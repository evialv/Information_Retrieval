relating to the excess medical expense deduction. The changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will simplify the means by which households with elderly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled members claim deductions from income for verified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective, non-reimbursed medical expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have retroactive effect unless so specified in the

challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are as follows: (1) for Program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant
to 7 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 2014(e)) which is reflected in this rule was enacted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 as section 1717 of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relief Act (1990 Leland Act), Title XVII, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624 (104 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stat. 3783, Nov. 28, 1990). This amendment was effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 1, 1992. The provisions of this rule are required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented not later than October 1, 1994, in order to assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all State agencies are in full compliance with the amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as soon as possible. For this reason, Ellen Haas, Assistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has determined pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 5 U.S.C. 553 that public comment on this rule prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation is impracticable and that good cause exists for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making this rule effective less than 30 days after its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication. However, because we believe the administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule may be improved by public comment, comments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicited on this rule for 60 days after publication. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received within the comment period will be analyzed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any appropriate changes will be incorporated in the subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of a final rule.

Section 351 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(102 Stat. 1645, September 19, 1988) (HPA) amended Section 5(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2014(e), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require State agencies to offer eligible households with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elderly or disabled member a method for claiming a deduction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recurring medical expenses in place of provisions that had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required households to report and verify expenses monthly. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 7, 1989, the Department published an interim rulemaking at

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1989 interim rule amended several provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations pertaining to the medical deduction, particularly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area of reporting and verification requirements for allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical expenses. Under the 1989 interim rule, households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to monthly reporting are given the option of either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and verifying all medical expenses monthly, or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and verifying changes in medical expenses in excess of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$25 occurring during the certification period, but they cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report under both procedures. The 1989 interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i) and (ii), (i)(1), and (j)(3)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to specify the household's options with regard to reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verifying medical expenses in a monthly reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrospective budgeting (MRRB) system. In addition, 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.12(a)(1)(vi) and 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3)(iii) were amended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 interim rule to simplify reporting changes in medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses. The 1989 interim rule required that changes in total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical expenses greater than $25 must be reported, as opposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a $25 change in each individual allowable medical expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the 1989 interim rule, the 1990 Leland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act was enacted. Regulations published to implement provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that Act superseded some of the changes made in the 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule. Section 1724 of the 1990 Leland Act delegated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each State agency the responsibility for design of the monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report form, including the determination of what information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to eligibility and benefits was to be included on that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. These provisions of section 1724 were implemented by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting Amendments and Mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes final rule, published on December 4, 1991 at 56 FR 63597. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming amendments to verification requirements associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the monthly report were also made at that time. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory amendments in the December 4, 1991 final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superseded the changes made to 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i), (ii), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii), and (i)(1) by the 1989 interim rule, because the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions concerned the information that the Department mandated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be contained on the monthly report form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments made to the regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(a)(vi) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.21(j)(iii) (C) and (D) by the 1989 interim rule were neither 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finalized nor superseded by subsequent regulations. As explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below, however, the Department is now making new amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1717 of the 1990 Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Stamp Act to provide for a simplified means for eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households to claim the excess medical expense deduction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recurring medical costs. Section 1717 requires State agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate at certification a recipient's recurring medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses for the certification period based upon the recipient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current verified medical expenses, as well as available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the recipient's medical condition, and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or private medical insurance coverage. The household's medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction would be based on these estimates, and further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification would not be required. In a proposed rule entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Miscellaneous Provisions of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hunger Relief Act and Food Stamp Certification Policy,'' published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on June 28, 1991 (56 FR 29594), the Department stated that food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stamp regulations at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8) and 273.12(a)(6) already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected the intent of the statute and that, therefore, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change to the regulations was required. No comments disputing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this position were received, and the position was reiterated in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule published on December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63594). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has come to the attention of the Department that some State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may not be properly applying section 1717. This may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to confusion on the part of State agencies with regard to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's decision not to issue regulations in connection with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1717. To ensure that State agencies are in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 1717, the Department issued three memoranda to FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional offices, dated February 3, 1994, April 1, 1994, and May 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12, 1994. In the memoranda, the Department instructed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional offices to remind State agencies that they must be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the provisions of section 1717. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also offered direction as to how the State agencies can implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of section 1717. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a further effort to insure that State agencies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the provisions of section 1717, the Department is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending food stamp regulations that concern the medical expense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction. These changes will clarify current regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better express the intent of section 1717. Accordingly, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule amends 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i), 273.10(d)(4), 273.12(a)(vi), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.21 (h), (i), and (j)(iii) (C) and (D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the amendments, the household will be required to report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and verify all medical expenses at certification and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recertification. The household's monthly medical deduction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its certification period will be based on the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported and verified by the household, and any anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the household's medical expenses that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably expected to occur during the certification period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on available information about the recipient's medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition, public or private insurance coverage, and current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified medical expenses. If the household reports a medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense at certification but cannot verify the expense at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, and if the amount of the expense cannot be reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated based on available information about the recipient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical condition, public or private insurance coverage, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current verified medical expenses, the expense will be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time the amount of the expense or reimbursement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported and verified. The household will not be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file reports about its medical expenses during the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. If the household voluntarily reports a change in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical expenses, the State agency will act on the changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with current regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(c).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also making a related amendment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(c) for changes in medical expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are discovered from a source other than the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, those regulations require the State agency to act on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all changes in a household's circumstances, including those it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovers from a source other than the household. Often times, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the State agency must contact the household to verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such unreported changes. Since the intent of section 1717 is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid recurrent reporting and verification on the part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households receiving the medical expense deduction, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is amending 7 CFR 273.12(c) to require that the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency act on those changes in medical expenses it learns of from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a source other than the household only if it can act without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contacting the household for further information or verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The household will be informed about the changes in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the notice requirements at 7 CFR 273.13. Those changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learned from a source other than the household which are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified upon receipt and therefore necessitate contact with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household for verification purposes shall not be acted upon until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household is recertified.

This rule is effective and must be implemented no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1994. For quality control purposes, any variances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the implementation of the rule shall be excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, in accordance with 7 CFR 275.12(d)(2)(vii). The provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be implemented for all households that newly apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program benefits on or after the required implementation date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current caseload shall be converted to these provisions at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's request, at the time of recertification, or when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case is next reviewed, whichever occurs first. The State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency must provide restored benefits to such households back to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required implementation date or the date of application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is later. If for any reason a State agency fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement on the required implementation date, restored benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be provided, if appropriate, back to the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation date or the date of application whichever is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As part of the Department of Commerce initiative to streamline export licensing requirements for exports to countries

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are demonstrating increased ability to safeguard reexports of U.S.-origin strategic goods and technology,
the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is extending to Taiwan export licensing benefits available under the provisions
of section 5(k) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA). This action will lessen the administrative
burden on U.S. exporters and their foreign customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, BXA is: Providing shorter processing times for license applications for Taiwan; and amending General
License GCG to authorize certain shipments of U.S.-origin commodities to Taiwan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to include new requirements based on the implementation
of Import Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV) procedures for Taiwan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The address for the authority administering the IC/DV system within Romania is also revised by this rule.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April, 1994, Taiwan implemented an island-wide IC/DV system. This system extends the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park IC/DV system and makes Taiwan eligible for general license GCG and 15 day/15 day license processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) requires a foreign importer to file an International Import Certificate
(IC) in support of individual validated license applications to export certain commodities controlled for national
security reasons to specified destinations. The commodities are identified by the code letter ``A'' following the
Export Control Classification Number on the Commerce Control List, which identifies those items subject to Department
of Commerce export controls. An IC is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking by the government of the country of ultimate destination to exercise legal control over the disposition
of those commodities covered by an IC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BXA also requires a Delivery Verification Certificate (DV) on a selective basis, as described in 15 CFR 775.3(i).
A DV is issued by the government of the country of ultimate destination after the exported commodities have either
entered the export jurisdiction of that country or are otherwise accounted for by the importer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New documentation practices adopted by Taiwan warrant the inclusion of that country in the IC/DV procedure. This
rule amends the EAR by revising Taiwan's entry within the list of countries that issue Import Certificates and by revising
the name and address of the Taiwan authorities in the list of foreign offices that administer the IC/DV systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main authority for administering the Taiwan IC/DV program is the Board of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic
Affairs. There are also two satellite offices: the Science-Based Industrial Park Administration and the Export
Processing Zone Administration. If the destination of the export is within the Science-Based Industrial Park or
the Export Processing Zone, then one should apply for the IC/DV at the appropriate satellite office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises the Romanian IC/DV authority address to the ``Authorities Administering Import Certificate/Delivery
Verification System in Foreign Countries'' table, Supplement No. 1 to Part 775. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and
the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994.

1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control numbers 0694&hyph;0001,
0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0007, 0695&hyph;0010, and 0694&hyph;0016. Licensing requirements under OMB control
numbers 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0007, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0694&hyph;0010 will be reduced as a result of this rule, while there will be a small increase under 0694&hyph;0001
and 0694&hyph;0016, thereby reducing overall the paperwork burden on the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Import Certificate issued by the Government of Taiwan does not constitute a collection of information under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in
the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subpart D of 24 CFR part 791 provides the procedures for allocating budget authority under section 213(d) of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1974 among the HUD Field Offices for certain programs specified in 24 CFR 791.101(a).
The regulations currently provide that budget authority for the Indian housing program under 24 CFR part 905 shall
be allocated on the basis of the relative housing needs of the Indian tribal population, ``as measured by the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, and by data for non-BIA recognized groups served by the Indian housing program.'' (See 24 CFR 791.402(c)(2).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) no longer provides data upon which HUD can make its determination. This rule amends
&sect;791.402(c)(2) to provide that HUD will base its determination upon data from the most recent, available decennial
census and, where appropriate, more recent data from the Bureau of the Census or other Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Justification for Final Rule Making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10, the Department generally publishes a rule for
public comment before issuing a rule for effect, unless to do so would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary
to the public interest. This rule is being published for effect without prior public comment because the Department
believes to do so would be unnecessary. The decennial census is the source of data used in making determinations for
allocating budget authority in non-Indian housing programs, and therefore, is one the Department has confidence
in as a reliable and objective source.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to internal administrative procedures
whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project areas or building
sites and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this document before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule revises existing procedures for the allocation of housing assistance funds, but
will make no change in the economic impact of these procedures on small entities.

The Family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

not have Federalism implications. Specifically, the rule will not substantially alter the established roles of
HUD and the States and local governments, including IHAs, in administering affected programs. As a result, the rule
is not subject to review.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides two alternative methods that taxpayers may use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for research or experimental expenditures. A taxpayer may either deduct the expenditures in the year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they are paid or incurred, or treat the expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as deferred expenses, amortizable over a period of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 months. In 1957, the IRS adopted &sect;1.174&hyph;2(a)(1), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures which represent research and development costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the experimental or laboratory sense (22 FR 7901 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(October 4, 1957)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the IRS proposed amendments to &sect;1.174&hyph;2(a)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clarify the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 15819 (March 24, 1993)). The amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also provide guidance regarding section 174(e), which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to the Code by the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 174(e) provides that the accounting rules of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
174 apply to a research or experimental expenditure only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent that the amount of the expenditure is reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS received comments on the proposed amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both in writing and at a public hearing on June 18, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Treasury decision adopts the proposed amendments with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several revisions in response to public comments.

A. Clarification of Uncertainty Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the 1957 regulations define 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as expenditures which represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research and development costs in the experimental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory sense. The proposed amendments provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures represent research and development costs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental or laboratory sense if they are for activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to discover information that would eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Under the proposed amendments, the requisite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty exists if the information reasonably available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the taxpayer does not establish the capability or method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for developing or improving the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commentators expressed concern that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty test provided in the proposed amendments could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be construed to limit unduly the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental expenditures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In particular, the commentators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that the test could exclude expenditures incurred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the appropriate design of a product if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer knows at the outset that the procedure will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful. In such a case, the taxpayer is not uncertain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to either its capability to develop the product or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method by which it will develop the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's knowledge that a product development project will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be successful does not preclude the process of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate design of the product from qualifying as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research. The Treasury Department and the IRS also agree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the language of the uncertainty test provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments could be construed to reach a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrary to that intended. The final amendments thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify the uncertainty test. Under the final amendments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requisite uncertainty exists if the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the taxpayer does not establish either (i) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability or method for developing or improving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, or (ii) the appropriate design of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The uncertainty test, as clarified in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments, reflects the dual purposes of section 174. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress enacted section 174 not only to encourage research, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but also to avoid the difficult tax accounting questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would arise regarding research expenditures in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of special tax accounting rules. See H. Rep. 1337, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954), reprinted in 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4017, 4053. These difficult tax accounting questions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be limited to cases in which the success of a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development project is in doubt. If a given line of inquiry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proves to be unfruitful, questions could arise regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the costs involved could be deducted, or whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge gained from the inquiry might contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently to the ultimate design of the product that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs must be capitalized. In short, the tax accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions that section 174 was meant to resolve can arise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever the taxpayer is uncertain as to the capability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for developing or improving the product, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate design of the product.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments apply the uncertainty test with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to ``the information reasonably available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer.'' The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commentators that the meaning of the phrase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is unclear. Further, the phrase could be read to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose an unintended restriction on the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research or experimental expenditures. Information could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably available
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to a taxpayer if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer can obtain the information through procedures that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while not particularly involved, are nonetheless in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of research activities. To avoid the ambiguities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the application of the uncertainty test with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the information actually available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer. The removal of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to expand the information considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Validation Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1957 regulations exclude from the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for quality control. Several commentators on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments asked for clarification that research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes validation testing to ensure that a product design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets its intended objectives. In response to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the final amendments clarify that the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion for quality control testing does not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing to determine if the design of a product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final amendments retain the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments, and thus apply to taxable years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning after October 3, 1994. Some commentators requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed amendments apply to all open taxable years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the amendments merely clarify the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental expenditures,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retroactive application of the amendments is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Return positions consistent with the amendments will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the existing regulations and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized as such by the IRS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on their impact on small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Definition of research and experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental expenditures,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as used in section 174, means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures incurred in connection with the taxpayer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade or business which represent research and development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs in the experimental or laboratory sense. The term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally includes all such costs incident to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development or improvement of a product. The term includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the costs of obtaining a patent, such as attorneys' fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expended in making and perfecting a patent application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expenditures represent research and development costs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental or laboratory sense if they are for activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to discover information that would eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Uncertainty exists if the information available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer does not establish the capability or method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing or improving the product or the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design of the product. Whether expenditures qualify as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research or experimental expenditures depends on the nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the activity to which the expenditures relate, not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the product or improvement being developed or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of technological advancement the product or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of this section, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
product
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes any pilot model, process, formula, invention, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique, patent, or similar property, and includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to be used by the taxpayer in its trade or business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as products to be held for sale, lease, or license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not include expenditures for_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ordinary testing or inspection of materials or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for quality control (quality control testing); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Efficiency surveys; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Management studies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Consumer surveys; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Advertising or promotions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The acquisition of another's patent, model, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production or process; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Research in connection with literary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical, or similar projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, testing or inspection to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular units of materials or products conform to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified parameters is quality control testing. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality control testing does not include testing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if the design of the product is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) See section 263A and the regulations thereunder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cost capitalization rules which apply to expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid or incurred for research in connection with literary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical, or similar projects involving the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property, including the production of films, sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordings, video tapes, books, or similar properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section 174 applies to a research or experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditure only to the extent that the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditure is reasonable under the circumstances. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, the amount of an expenditure for research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental activities is reasonable if the amount would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ordinarily be paid for like activities by like enterprises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under like circumstances. Amounts supposedly paid for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research that are not reasonable under the circumstances may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be characterized as disguised dividends, gifts, loans, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar payments. The reasonableness requirement of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(6) does not apply to the reasonableness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type or nature of the activities themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) This paragraph (a) applies to taxable years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning after October 3, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income housing credit under section 42 of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code. The regulations provide rules relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order in which housing credit dollar amounts are allocated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each State's housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination of which States qualify to receive credit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a national pool of credit under section 42(h)(3)(D). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations affect State and local housing credit agencies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayers receiving credit allocations, and provide them with

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 29, 1993, the IRS published a notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 68799) proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments provide guidance on several requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income housing tax credit relating to determinations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit dollar amount available to housing credit agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for allocation in any given year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written comments responding to the notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking were received. A public hearing was scheduled for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 26, 1994, pursuant to a notice of public hearing published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously with the notice of proposed rulemaking. The IRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received one request to speak at the public hearing. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request was withdrawn before the hearing date. On April 14, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, the IRS published a notice (59 FR 17747) cancelling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearing on the proposed regulations. After consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the comments received, the proposed regulations are adopted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised by this Treasury decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42 provides for a low-income housing credit that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be claimed as part of the general business credit under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. In general, the credit is allowable only if the owner of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified low-income building receives a housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation from a State or local housing credit agency (Agency) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the jurisdiction where the building is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aggregate housing credit dollar amount that an Agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocate for any calendar year is limited to the State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling apportioned to the Agency for that year. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 42(h)(3)(C), the State housing credit ceiling of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State for any calendar year is an amount equal to the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) $1.25 multiplied by the State population (the population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); (b) the unused State housing credit ceiling, if any, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the State for the preceding calendar year (the unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component); (c) the amount of State housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ceiling returned in the calendar year (the returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); plus (d) the amount, if any, allocated to the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D) from a national pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of unused credit (the national pool component). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations set forth the rules governing the order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which credit is allocated from the various components of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C) (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stacking rules). In general, under the stacking rules, credit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated first from the sum of the population and returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit components, then from the unused carryforward component, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and finally from the national pool component. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations also reflect the statutory rule that unallocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit attributable to the national pool component cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried forward, and, therefore, is not included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component for the following year. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations provide that no credit allocated prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year 1990, and no credit allowable under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(h)(4) (relating to the portion of credit attributable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible basis financed by certain tax-exempt obligations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 103), may be returned for reallocation. Thus, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is not included in the returned credit component for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator requested clarification of the rule in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations that if the terms of the allocation violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any requirement of section 42, the allocation is not valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the commentator expressed concern that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misrepresentation by a taxpayer to an Agency would result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation being treated as not valid and as if it had never been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made and ineligible for treatment as a returned credit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations do not include this statement. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of whether an allocation is valid is not within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope of these regulations. Second, given the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that an allocation must be valid to qualify as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit, it is unnecessary to include the additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that, if the terms of the allocation violate any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of section 42, the allocation is not valid and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as if it had not been made. However, for all purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 42, including qualification as a returned credit, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation must be validly made. See, for example, &sect;&sect;1.42&hyph;1T and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.42&hyph;6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations adopt the provision of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations requiring that if a credit is returned within 180 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days following the close of the first taxable year of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building's credit period and a Form 8609,

Low-Income Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit Allocation Certification,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been issued for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building, an Agency must notify the IRS that the credit has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned. One commentator requested that the procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying the IRS be clarified. Accordingly, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations clarify that if all of the credit is returned, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency must follow the procedures in &sect;1.42&hyph;5(e)(3) for filing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form 8823, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncompliance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In situations where the credit is only partially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned, the Agency must follow the procedures prescribed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing an amended Form 8610, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual Low-Income Housing Credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations permit an Agency to treat credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned from a project to the Agency after October 31 of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year and not reallocated by the Agency by the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the year as returned at the beginning of the succeeding calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year (the two-month rule). One commentator suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-month rule of the proposed regulations be changed to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more time to reallocate credits before the close of the calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Accordingly, the final regulations provide that credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the Agency after September 30 of any calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and not reallocated by the close of the year may be treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned at the beginning of the succeeding calendar year. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to another comment, the final regulations clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Agency, in its discretion, may treat a portion of a credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is so returned and that is not reallocated before the close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the calendar year as returned in the next calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, to the extent any portion of a credit returned after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 30 of any calendar year is allocated by the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year in which it is returned, that portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is included as part of the returned credit component of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State housing credit ceiling for the year in which the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide that, if an allocation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancelled by mutual consent, a signed and dated written agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Agency and the allocation recipient (or its successor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interest) must indicate the amount of the allocation returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the date on which the credit is returned. Commentators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that, if the terms of an allocation state that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused amounts are automatically returned to the Agency by mutual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement, the regulations should not require a signed and dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written agreement. If this suggestion were adopted, neither the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IRS nor the Agency would know with enough precision the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit returned and the date on which the credit is returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information is necessary to determine with certainty the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component of the State housing credit ceiling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to avoid discrepancies in the amount of credit allocated to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular project. Thus, the final regulations do not adopt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this suggestion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under section 42(h)(3)(D), States that have unused housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit carryovers must assign them to the Secretary for inclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a national pool of unused housing credit carryovers (National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pool), and the Secretary must allocate National Pool credit among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether there is any unallocated credit within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State at the close of a calendar year, the housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amounts apportioned to all Agencies within the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including Agencies of constitutional home rule cities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State) and the allocations of all Agencies within the State are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered. One commentator suggested that a constitutional home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule city be considered alone rather than in combination with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other constitutional home rule cities or Agencies within a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining access to the National Pool. Section 42(h)(3)(E) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does provide special rules for apportioning credits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutional home rule cities. Under these rules, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits are apportioned to these cities from the State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling. There is no provision in the Code that permits a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutional home rule city to receive credit that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apportioned from the State housing credit ceiling. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final regulations do not adopt this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to a de minimis exception for States that have 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or less of unallocated credit remaining in their State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling at the close of a calendar year (de 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimis rule), the proposed regulations provide that, in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances where relief is deemed appropriate, the IRS may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine that a State is a qualified State eligible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the National Pool. One commentator requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that cannot allocate their entire ceiling as a result of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural disaster be allowed to participate in the National Pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This type of relief exceeds the scope and intent behind the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited exception provided in the proposed regulations. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this type of relief would be inequitable to other States that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for the National Pool. Thus, the final regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not adopt this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentator suggested that the de minimis rule provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an alternative fixed dollar amount measurement of de minimis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount to reflect unallocated amounts that are, as a practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, insufficient to provide an allocation to a project. Due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to variations in construction and housing costs across the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, this suggestion was not adopted. Similarly, a suggestion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the final regulations provide a separate de minimis rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the set-aside for nonprofit organizations was not adopted. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations, however, these situations can be addressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the IRS on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, if appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional safe harbors could be provided in the future (e.g., to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to other common situations not addressed by the 1 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations also amend &sect;1.42&hyph;5 to provide a cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to section 42(g)(8)(B), as added by section 13142(b)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Section 42(g)(8)(B) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that on application by the taxpayer, the Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waive any annual recertification of tenant income (the Waiver) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of section 42(g), if the entire building is occupied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by low-income tenants. Instructions on how to obtain the Waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be contained in a forthcoming revenue procedure.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State housing credit ceiling for a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any calendar year after 1989 is comprised of four components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four components are_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) $1.25 multiplied by the State population (the population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The unused State housing credit ceiling, if any, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State for the preceding calendar year (the unused carryforward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The amount of State housing credit ceiling returned in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year (the returned credit component); plus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The amount, if any, allocated to the State by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D) from a national pool of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused credit (the national pool component). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The population component. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The population component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State housing credit ceiling of a State for any calendar year is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined pursuant to section 146(j). Thus, a State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population for any calendar year is determined by reference to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most recent census estimate, whether final or provisional, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resident population of the State released by the Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Census before the beginning of the calendar year for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State's housing credit ceiling is set. Unless otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by applicable revenue procedure, determinations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population are based on the most recent estimates of population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the Bureau of the Census publication, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projections, Estimates of the Population of States. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convenience, the Internal Revenue Service publishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population estimates annually in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The unused carryforward component. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component of the State housing credit ceiling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any calendar year is the excess, if any, of the sum of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and returned credit components, over the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit dollar amount allocated for the year. Any credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts attributable to the national pool component of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling that remain unallocated at the close of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year are not carried forward to the succeeding calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year; instead, the credit expires and cannot be reallocated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The returned credit component_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component of the State housing credit ceiling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any calendar year equals the housing credit dollar amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned during the calendar year that was validly allocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the State in a prior calendar year to any project that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not become a qualified low-income housing project within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period required by section 42, or as required by the terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation. The returned credit component also includes credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated in a prior calendar year that is returned as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cancellation of an allocation by mutual consent or by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's determination that the amount allocated is not necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the financial feasibility of the project. For purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, credit is allocated within a State if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated from the State's housing credit ceiling by an Agency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State or of a constitutional home rule city in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitations and special rules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and special rules apply for purposes of this paragraph (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this paragraph (d), returned credit does not include any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit that was_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Allocated prior to calendar year 1990; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Allowable under section 42(h)(4) (relating to the portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of credit attributable to eligible basis financed by certain tax-exempt bonds under section 103); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Allocated during the same calendar year that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received back by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Credit period limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of this paragraph (d), an allocation of credit may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be returned any later than 180 days following the close of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first taxable year of the credit period for the building that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received the allocation. After this date, credit that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise be returned expires, and cannot be returned to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reallocated by any Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Three-month rule for returned credit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Agency may, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its discretion, treat any portion of credit that is returned from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a project after September 30 of a calendar year and that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reallocated by the close of the calendar year as returned on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1 of the succeeding calendar year. In this case, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit becomes part of the returned credit component of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State housing credit ceiling for the succeeding calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Any portion of credit that is returned from a project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after September 30 of a calendar year that is reallocated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close of the calendar year is treated as part of the returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit component of the State housing credit ceiling for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year that the credit was returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Returns of credit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to the limitations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (d)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, credit is returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Agency in the following instances in the manner described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building not qualified within required time period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is not a qualified building within the time period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by section 42, it loses its credit allocation and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is returned. For example, a building is not qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the required time period if it is not placed in service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the period required by section 42 or if the project of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the building is a part fails to meet the minimum set-aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of section 42(g)(1) by the close of the first year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the credit period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncompliance with terms of the allocation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not comply with the terms of its allocation, it loses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit allocation and the credit is returned. The terms of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation are the written conditions agreed to by the Agency and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allocation recipient in the allocation document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Mutual consent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Agency and the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient cancel an allocation of an amount of credit by mutual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consent, that amount of credit is returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amount not necessary for financial feasibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency determines under section 42(m)(2) that an amount of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated to a project is not necessary for the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility of the project and its viability as a qualified low-income housing project throughout the credit period,
that amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of credit is returned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manner of returning credit_(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Taxpayer notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After an Agency determines that a building or project no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifies under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A), (B), or (D) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section for all or part of the allocation it received, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide written notification to the allocation recipient, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its successor in interest, that all or part of the allocation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer valid. The notification must also state the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allocation that is no longer valid. The date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification is the date the credit is returned to the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an allocation is cancelled by mutual consent under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, there must be a written agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed by the Agency, and the allocation recipient, or its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successor in interest, indicating the amount of the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is returned to the Agency. The effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement is the date the credit is returned to the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Internal Revenue Service notification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a credit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned within 180 days following the close of the first taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year of a building's credit period as provided in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

has been issued for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building, the Agency must notify the Internal Revenue Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the credit has been returned. If only part of the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been returned, this notification requirement is satisfied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the Agency attaches to an amended Form 8610,

Form 8609 reflecting the correct amount of credit attributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the building together with an explanation for the filing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended Forms. The Agency must send a copy of the amended Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8609 to the taxpayer that owns the building. If the building is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not issued an amended Form 8609 because all of the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated to the building is returned, notification to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Service is satisfied by following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements prescribed in &sect;1.42&hyph;5(e)(3) for filing a Form 8823,

(e) The national pool component. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The national pool component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the State housing credit ceiling of a State for any calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year is the portion of the National Pool allocated to the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Secretary for the calendar year. The national pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component for any calendar year is zero unless a State is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
qualified State. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(See paragraph (i) of this section for rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the National Pool and the description of a qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State.) Credit from the national pool component of a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling must be allocated prior to the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year or the credit expires and cannot be reallocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by any Agency. A national pool component credit that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated during a calendar year and returned after the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year may qualify as part of the returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component of the State housing credit ceiling for the calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year that the credit is returned.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apportionment for projects involving qualified nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations described in section 42(h)(5) and &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(c)(5), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State housing credit ceiling for any calendar year is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined at the close of the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stacking order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 42(h)(3)(C), credit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as allocated from the various components of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling in the following order. The first credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated for any calendar year is treated as credit from the sum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the population and returned credit components of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling. Once all of the credit in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components has been allocated, the next credit allocated is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as credit from the unused carryforward component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State housing credit ceiling. Finally, after all of the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the population component, returned credit component, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused carryforward component has been allocated, any further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit allocated is treated as credit from the national pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component.

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 42(h)(5) and &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(c)(5), at least 10 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State housing credit ceiling in any calendar year must be set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aside exclusively for projects involving qualified nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations (the nonprofit set-aside). However, credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated from the nonprofit set-aside in a calendar year and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned in a subsequent calendar year does not retain its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit set-aside character. The credit becomes part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component of the State housing credit ceiling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year that the credit is returned and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in determining the nonprofit set-aside of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling for that calendar year. Similarly, credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts that are not allocated from the nonprofit set-aside in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year and are returned in a subsequent calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become part of the returned credit component of the State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling for that year and are also included in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the set-aside for that year.

An Agency may allocate credit from any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component of the State housing credit ceiling as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit set-aside and need not reserve 10 percent of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component for the nonprofit set-aside. Thus, an Agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the nonprofit set-aside requirement of section 42(h)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(c)(5) in any calendar year by setting aside for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation an amount equal to at least 10 percent of the total

National Pool even though the State's unallocated credit is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the 1 percent safe harbor set forth in paragraph (A) of

this section. The Internal Revenue Service will make this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination based on all the facts and circumstances, weighing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavily the interests of the States who would otherwise qualify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the National Pool. The Internal Revenue Service will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated to a qualified State in any calendar year is an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that bears the same ratio to the aggregate unused housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryovers of all States for the preceding calendar year as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's population for the calendar year bears to the population

of all qualified States for the calendar year.

of this section are complied with. For example, the Filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency of a State must ensure that all Agencies within the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were apportioned a credit amount for the calendar year have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated all of their respective credit amounts for the calendar

Agency A had allocated $80 of the State M housing credit ceiling.

Of the $80 allocated, $16 was allocated to projects involving

qualified nonprofit organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of stacking rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The first credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated is treated as allocated from the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components of the State housing credit ceiling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the extent of those components. In this case, the $80 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit allocated is less than the sum of the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components. The excess of the sum of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and returned credit components over the total amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated for the calendar year ($110^80=$30) becomes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused carryforward component of State M's 1995 State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling. Because Agency A did not allocate credit in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the sum of the population and returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, no credit is treated as allocated from State M's $50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused carryforward component in 1994. Because none of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component may be carried forward, all $50 is assigned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool. Under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from

the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonprofit set-aside
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Agency A allocated exactly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of credit to projects involving qualified nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations as necessary to meet the nonprofit set-aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement ($16, 10% of the $160 ceiling).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. By the close of 1994, Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A had allocated $130 of the State M housing credit ceiling. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $130 allocated, $20 was allocated to projects involving

qualified nonprofit organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of stacking rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The first $110 of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated is treated as allocated from the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components. In this case, because all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and returned credit components are allocated, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount is included in State M's 1995 State housing credit ceiling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an unused carryforward component. The next $20 of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated is treated as allocated from the $50 unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component. The $30 remaining in the unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component is assigned to the Secretary for inclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. Under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonprofit set-aside
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Agency A allocated $4 more credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to meet the nonprofit set-aside requirement. This does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reduce the application of the 10% nonprofit set-aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to the State M housing credit ceiling for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
succeeding year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional fact
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. None of the applications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit that Agency A received for 1994 are for projects involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified nonprofit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonprofit set-aside
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because at least 10% of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling must be set aside for projects involving a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified nonprofit organization, Agency A can allocate only $144 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the $160 State housing credit ceiling for calendar year 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
($160^16=$144). If Agency A allocates $144 of credit, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is treated as allocated $110 from the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components and $34 from the unused carryforward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component. The $16 of unallocated credit that is set aside for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations is treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the balance of the unused carryforward component, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for credit from the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The $10 of returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component was returned prior to October 1, 1994. However, a $40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit that had been allocated in calendar year 1993 to a project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving a qualified nonprofit organization was returned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency by a mutual consent agreement dated November 15, 1994. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the close of 1994, Agency A had allocated $160 of the State M 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling, including $16 of credit to projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving qualified nonprofit organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of three-month rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the three-month rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, Agency A may treat all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or part of the $40 of previously allocated credit as returned on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1995. If Agency A treats all of the $40 amount as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having been returned in calendar year 1995, the State M housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling for 1994 is $160. This entire amount, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $16 nonprofit set-aside, has been allocated in 1994. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M qualifies for the

. If Agency A treats all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $40 of previously allocated credit as returned in calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1994, the State housing credit ceiling for the 1994 calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year will be $200 of which $50 will be attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component ($10+$40=$50). Because credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts allocated in a prior calendar year that are returned in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent calendar year do not retain their nonprofit character, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nonprofit set-aside for calendar year 1994 is $20 (10% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$200). The $160 that Agency A allocated during 1994 is first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as from the population and returned credit components, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which total $150. The next $10 of credit allocated is treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the unused carryforward component. The $40 of unallocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit from the unused carryforward component includes the $4 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unallocated nonprofit set-aside. The entire $40 of credit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the carryforward component is assigned to the Secretary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. State

M does not qualify for credit from the National Pool for the 1995

calendar year.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of the Canadian National Railway Company, the Coast Guard is changing the operating regulations governing
the Canadian National railroad bridge at mile 3.8 across the Black Rock Canal in Buffalo, New York, by not requiring
bridgetenders to be in constant attendance at the bridge during periods of time when there is little or no significant
navigation on the Canal. This action will relieve the bridge owner of the burden of having a bridgetender in constant
attendance and will provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. Additionally, this rule adjusts the hours of
the Ferry Street bridge at mile 2.6 across the Black Rock Canal when the bridge is not required to have a bridgetender
in attendance.

Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 1, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbrige Operation Regulations;
Black Rock Canal, NY, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 28324 and 28325). On June 17, 1994, the commander, Ninth Coast Guard District published the proposed rule as
a Public Notice (PN 09&hyph;03/94). Interested persons were given until August 1, 1994, and July 18, 1994, respectively,
to submit comments. Two letters were received commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one
was not held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Presently, the Canadian National railroad bridge is required to have bridgetenders in constant attendance at all
times. The owner requested that they be allowed to remove bridgetenders from the bridge between the hours of 11 p.m.
and 7 a.m., seven days a week, from April 15 through November 30, with a requirement to open the bridge on signal when
notice is given at least two hours in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draw. From December
1 through April 14, the bridge would be unattended at all times with a requirement to open the bridge on signal if notice
is given at least four hours in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draw. At all times, the bridge
will be required to open as soon as possible for the passage of public vessels of the United States, State or local government
vessels used for public safety, and vessels in distress.

Discussion of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received from the notice of proposed rulemaking requesting that the hours when the bridges are unattended
be changed. The commenters requested the unattended periods for the bridges listed in the proposed rule, 11 p.m. to
7 a.m., be changed to conform with the period of time when the Black Rock Locks are unattended, between the hours of 12
midnight and 8 a.m., seven days a week. In addition, the regulations contained in 33 CFR 117.769 do not require the Ferry
Street bridge across the Black Rock Canal to be manned from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. The requested change of time is a reasonable
request and will benefit marine traffic using the Black Rock Canal by bringing the time period for the bridges and locks
in line when a vessel owner/operator is required to give an advance notice to transit the Canal. Therefore, section
117.769(a) of the proposed rule has been changed in the final rule by not requiring the bridges to be manned between
the hours of 12 midnight to 8 a.m.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. The Coast Guard concludes this because the rule which is being changed allows for the removal
of bridgetenders during a period of time when there is little or no significant navigation on a waterway. In addition
this rule establishes a consistent period of time when an advance notice is required to have the bridges manned which
is less confusing to the person requesting passage through the locks and draws of the bridges.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this action will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time period addressed by this regulation is consistent with the time period when most traffic using the Black Rock
Canal is already controlled by the operation of the Black Rock Locks and when there is little or no significant vessel
traffic on the waterway. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically
excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination Statement has been
prepared and placed in the docket.

1. Section 3507(f) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, 44 U.S.C. 3507(f), requires agencies to display
a current control number assigned by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for each agency
information collection requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 0.408 of the Commission's Rules displays the OMB control numbers assigned to the Commission's non-form
information collection requirements. OMB control numbers assigned to Commission forms are not listed in this section
since those numbers appear on the forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This Order amends Section 0.408 to remove listings of information collections which the Commission has eliminated
and to add listings of new information collections which OMB has approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Authority for this action is contained in Section 4(i) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 154(i)), as amended,
and Section 0.231(d) of the Commission's Rules. Since this amendment is a matter of agency organization procedure
or practice, the notice and comment and effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply.
See 5 U.S.C. Section 553(b)(A)(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Accordingly, it is ordered, that &sect;0.408 of the Rules is amended as set forth in the Amendatory text, effective
on the date of publication in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a technical amendment to clarify regulations that prohibit a vessel from participating in the Gulf of
Alaska (GOA) directed sablefish hook-and-line gear fishery when hook-and-line gear was deployed from that vessel
within 72 hours prior to the opening of that fishery. This technical amendment clarifies this prohibition by stating
that it applies only to vessels that deployed hook-and-line gear in the GOA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 72 hours prior to the start of that fishery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS published a final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 28520, May 14, 1993) that prohibits participation in the GOA directed sablefish fishery by a vessel that has
deployed hook-and-line gear within 72 hours prior to the opening of that fishery. The rule was intended to apply only
to vessels that deployed gear in the GOA in advance of that fishery. As written, the rule implied that a vessel is prohibited
from participating in the GOA directed sablefish fishery if the vessel deployed hook-and-line gear in any fishery
within 72 hours prior to that opening. This interpretation is inconsistent with the preamble to the proposed rule,
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17193), which explains that the prohibition applies only to vessels that deploy hook-and-gear
in the GOA within 72 hours prior to the opening. Because hook-and-line vessel operators participating in fisheries
in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area have expressed uncertainty as to the regulatory intent, &sect;672.7(k)
is clarified to specify that this prohibition applies only to vessels that fished in the GOA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for Atka mackerel was established by the final 1994
specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1,000 metric tons (mt) for the Central Regulatory Area. At the same
time, the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the GOA was closed under &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii) in the final 1994
specifications in order to reserve amounts anticipated to be needed for incidental catch by other fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that, as of September 17, 1994, 995 mt of Atka mackerel in the Central
Regulatory Area of the GOA remains unharvested. This amount is in excess of the amount necessary as incidental catch
for other groundfish fisheries. Therefore, NMFS is terminating this closure and opening directed fishing for Atka
mackerel in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994, until 12 midnight,
A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other closures remain in full force and effect.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing regulations on certain requirements governing the submission,
review, and approval of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's). Specifically, these new regulations pertain
to patent issues, certification and notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent by ANDA
applicants, effective date of approval of an application under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act),
and new drug product exclusivity. These regulations are intended to complete FDA's implementation of Title I of the
Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 24, 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) (the
1984 amendments) was enacted. The law consisted of two different titles. Title I authorized the approval of duplicate
versions of approved drug products (other than those reviewed and approved under section 507 of the act (21 U.S.C.
357)) under an ANDA procedure. Title II authorized the extension of patent terms for approved new drug products (including
antibiotics and biological drug products), some medical devices, food additives, and color additives. Congress
intended these provisions to provide a careful balance between promoting competition among brand-name and duplicate
or ``generic'' drugs and encouraging research and innovation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title I also amended section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) by requiring all New Drug Application (NDA) applicants and
holders to provide certain patent information, requiring ANDA applicants to certify as to the status of patents claiming
the drug product they intend to copy, providing for the submission and approval of applications for which the investigations
relied on by the applicant to satisfy the ``full reports'' of safety and effectiveness requirements were not conducted
by the applicant or for which the applicant had not obtained a right of reference or use from the person who conducted
the investigations, establishing rules for disclosure of safety and effectiveness data submitted as part of an NDA,
and providing specific time periods during which an NDA or an ANDA cannot be submitted or approved. The 1984 amendments
also required FDA to promulgate new regulations implementing the statute. In the

II. Highlights of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Patent Information, Certification, and Notice of Certification to Patent Owner and Certain Application Holders

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute prohibits the agency from making effective the approval of an ANDA or an application described by section
505(b)(2) of the act (referred to as a 505(b)(2) application) before all relevant product and use patents for the listed
drug (a drug product listed in an approved drug product list published by the agency) have expired, except where the
generic applicant asserts either that its product will not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. In the
latter case, approval of the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application may not be made effective until the patent owner and
the NDA holder have been notified and have had an opportunity to litigate the issue of patent infringement or validity.
To facilitate the patent protection provisions, the statute requires that applications submitted under section
505(b) of the act include the patent number and expiration date of all relevant patents that claim the drug (including
product and formulation patents) in the application or use patents that claim a method of using the drug. The agency
publishes this patent information in its approved drug product list (``Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic
Equivalence Evaluations,'' also known as the ``Orange Book'') for each listed drug for which patent information
has been submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A generic drug applicant submitting an ANDA that refers to a listed drug must include a certification as to the status
of all patents applicable to the listed drug. Similarly, an applicant submitting a 505(b)(2) application must make
certifications with respect to patents claiming any listed drug or claiming a use for such listed drug. If a generic
applicant certifies that a relevant patent expires on a specified date, the effective date of approval of the ANDA
or 505(b)(2) application will be delayed until the expiration of the patent. Thus, for example, if the patent expired
on January 1, 1995, the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application would be January 1, 1995. The
agency regards drug products with delayed effective dates as having tentative approvals; it does not consider the
approval to be final until the effective date and the issuance of a final approval letter (see 57 FR 17950 at 17956).
When a generic applicant certifies that any product or use patent is invalid or will not be infringed, the applicant
must give notice of such certification to the patent owner and appropriate approved application holder for the listed
drug. The generic applicant must include in the notice the factual and legal basis for the applicant's opinion that
the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. Finally, a patent owner has 45 days from receipt of the notice of certification
to file suit against the generic applicant to defend the patent. If the patent owner files suit within 45 days, the effective
date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be delayed up to 30 months pending resolution of the lawsuit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule describes: (1) The requirements for the submission of patent information by an NDA holder or applicant,
(2) the patent certification requirements applicable to generic applicants, and (3) the content of a patent certification
notice. The final rule also specifies: (1) When and to whom the notice is to be sent, and (2) the effect of each type of
patent certification on the effective date of approval of an application for a generic drug product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Exclusivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 505(c)(3)(D) and (j)(4)(D) of the act protects certain listed drugs, or certain changes in listed drugs,
from generic copying for specified periods by placing a moratorium on the submission, or by delaying the effective
date of approval, of ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications for those listed drugs. These so-called ``exclusivity provisions''
provide the following periods of protection from generic competition: (1) A 10-year period of exclusivity for new
chemical entities approved during the period January 1, 1982, to September 24, 1984, the date of enactment of the 1984
amendments; (2) a 5-year period of exclusivity for new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984; (3) a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3-year period of exclusivity for drugs that are not new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984, if the
applicant submitted an application containing reports of ``new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability
studies) essential to approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant''; (4) a 3-year period of exclusivity
for certain changes made after September 24, 1984, if the applicant submitted a supplement containing reports of
``new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to approval and conducted or sponsored
by the person submitting the application''; and (5) a 2-year period of exclusivity for drugs that are not new chemical
entities, or for certain changes made to already approved drug products, approved during the period January 1, 1982,
to September 24, 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is codifying the provisions regarding 5- and 3-year exclusivity; FDA is not codifying the other exclusivity
provision because they have expired. The final rule also defines certain terms used in the regulations, and clarifies
the agency's interpretation of each of the provisions.

III. Comments on the Proposed Rule

A. Section 314.50_Content and Format of an Application (21 CFR 314.50) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contained several additions to the existing requirements in &sect;314.50. The proposed additions
focused on patent information and certifications and claimed exclusivity. Under proposed &sect;314.50(i), for
example, a 505(b)(2) applicant would be required to include in its application one of four possible certifications:
(1) That patent information on the reference listed drug had not been submitted to FDA; (2) that the patent had expired;
(3) the date on which the patent will expire; or (4) that the patent was invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture,
use, or sale of the proposed drug product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Two comments objected to the provision regarding use patents (patents that claim a use for the patented invention)
under proposed &sect;314.50(i). The comments explained that the provision would permit applicants to decide whether
a use would infringe a patent and whether the patent owner should be notified. Both comments asked FDA to require applicants
to send a certification of invalidity or noninfringement to all patent owners whose patents claim the active ingredient
involved in the proposed drug product. One comment would also revise the provision to withhold approval of an application
if the patent owner disagreed with the patent certification in order to give the patent owner an opportunity to initiate
a lawsuit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation corresponds to the statutory language at section 505(b)(2)(B) of the act. The statute does not require
a patent certification with respect to a use patent if the applicant is seeking approval for a drug product that does
not claim a use protected by the patent. FDA also declines to revise the provision to have FDA withhold approval of an
application under these circumstances. The statute provides express and specific grounds for delaying an effective
date of approval (see section 505(c)(3) of the act). These do not include any express authority to delay an effective
date of approval based on an inadequate notice, and the agency is not prepared to infer such authority. NDA holders
are advised, however, to notify FDA of the patented uses that appear in the approved labeling for their products; this
will enable the agency to provide some guidance to applicants required to submit either a patent certification under
section 505(b)(2)(A) or (j)(2)(A) of the act, or a statement under section 505(b)(2)(B) or (j)(2)(A)(viii) of the
act. These uses will be listed in the Orange Book. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. One comment noted that ``United States Office of Patent and Trademark'' in proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i) should
be ``United States Patent and Trademark Office.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has revised the provision accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. One comment asked FDA to give examples of patent certifications under proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to (i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). As proposed, these provisions would require an applicant to certify that: (1) No patent information had been submitted
to FDA, (2) the patent has expired, or (3) the patent would expire on a specific date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, most applicants making paragraph I, II, or III patent certifications simply paraphrase the language
used in &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to (i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for each patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agency, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A) to replace the reference to a patent that
claims ``the drug or drugs'' with a patent that claims ``a drug (the drug product or drug substance that is a component
of the drug product).'' The agency has made this amendment to clarify the types of patents for which a certification
should be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The agency, on its own initiative, has also amended &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (21 CFR 314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)) to include a reference to unenforceable patents. As proposed, these provisions would have required applicants
to certify that a patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product that
is the subject of the application. The agency has revised these certification statements to clarify how an applicant
challenging a patent as unenforceable should word its paragraph IV certification. Although the agency realizes
that courts have, in patent cases, distinguished invalid patents from unenforceable patents, the only court addressing
the issue of unenforceable patents in the context of the provisions of section 505 of the act interpreted the phrase
``invalid or not infringed'' to include an unenforceable patent. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 873 F.2d 1418 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (applying section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act).) The agency agrees with the court's
construction of the act. The alternative interpretation, precluding applicants challenging patents as unenforceable
from filing certifications under paragraph IV, would be contrary to Congress' obvious intent in allowing patent
challenges under section 505 of the act and would lead to absurd results. Subsequent to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also made corresponding changes to other provisions, such as the notice requirements in &sect;&sect;314.52
and 314.95, to include certifications for ``unenforceable'' patents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Two comments disagreed with proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii), which would require an applicant to state that,
in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge, there are no patents that claim the drug or drugs on which investigations
that the applicant relied upon in its application were conducted or that claim a use for the drug or drugs. One comment
said applicants should only be required to certify that there are no listed patents. The other comment suggested deleting
the provision and combining this patent certification with a paragraph I (no patent information submitted) certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes the comments have misconstrued proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii). The provision would require a ``no
relevant patents'' certification if, ``in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge,'' there are
no patents described in the patent certification section (&sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)). In other words, if an applicant
made one of the four patent certifications under &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i), the applicant would not make another certification
under &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. One comment strongly objected to proposed &sect;314.50(i)(4). The provision would require section 505(b)(2)
applicants whose applications were submitted after the late patent information is filed, or did not contain an appropriate
patent certification at the time of the late submission, to submit a patent certification on such patents. The comment
explained that section 505(d)(6) and 505(e)(4) of the act authorizes the agency, after providing an opportunity
for a hearing, to refuse to approve an application or to withdraw approval of an NDA for failure to provide patent information.
Thus, the comment argued that proposed &sect;314.50(i)(4) conferred a benefit on NDA applicants by permitting late
patent information submissions without applying the statutory requirements for timely submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered this and other comments which suggest regulatory approaches for handling patents that
are filed outside the statutory time limits. Congress clearly intended to enforce timely submission of patent information.
The statute requires that patent information be submitted with the application, by amendment prior to approval of
the application, or within 30 days after the patent issues. (See 21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1) and (c)(2)). For the most extreme
example of untimely patent filing_when a pioneer fails to file required patent information within 30 days of notice
from the agency_Congress has provided the extreme remedy of withdrawal of approval of the new drug application. (See
21 U.S.C. 355(e)(4)). Congress did not directly address the question of patent filings that occur more than 30 days
after issuance of the patent and for which the agency does not provide notice of the deficiency. The agency could treat
these filings in a number of ways. The agency could refuse to publish in the list the untimely patent information. This
approach has been rejected because it would provide no notice to subsequent 505(b)(2) or ANDA applicants that a patent
exists that the NDA holder believes is applicable to the pioneer drug product. Absence of publication could lead an
applicant to submit a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA that it would not have submitted had the patent been listed.
As a result, the applicant and the agency may expend resources unnecessarily. In addition, 505(b)(2) or ANDA applicants
could thereby subject themselves and the NDA holder to unnecessary patent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to publication of the proposed rule, the agency was asked to consider regulatory language designed to allow
a pioneer holder to update, at any time, its patent information. This approach has been rejected because it would allow
for manipulation of the patent filing system by the holder of the NDA and could result in delays in approval of otherwise
approvable ANDA's. For example, if patents could be filed at any time after issuance, the holder of the NDA could delay
the filing of a patent, and subsequent publication, until within 30 months prior to the expiration of the latest-expiring
patent. Even if the ANDA applicant does not believe the patent is applicable to the pioneer drug, it will then be required
either to file a paragraph III certification and wait until the patent expires, or to file a paragraph IV certification
and therefore initiate the procedure set out at section 505(c)(3)(C) and (j)(4)(B). This procedure requires that
the agency wait at least 30 months, unless a shorter or longer period is judicially ordered, before it makes effective
approval of the application. Even if the NDA holder is unsuccessful in defending the late-filed patent, it will have
extended its period of market monopoly in a manner inconsistent with the intent of Congress when it struck the balance
between protecting the patent rights of innovators and encouraging prompt and efficient entry of generics onto the
market. By requiring timely filing of patent information, the agency hopes to permit judicial resolution of patent
disputes without unduly extending the innovator's period of patent protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach adopted by the agency as best embodying the compromise adopted by Congress requires that if an NDA applicant
submits required patent information on an approved drug product more than 30 days after issuance of the patent, FDA
will publish the untimely information, but will not require ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants with pending applications
who have previously submitted a certification, i.e. those applicants who would be prejudiced by the late submission,
to recertify to the new patent. Only applicants who initially submit ANDA's or 505(b)(2) applications after the submission
of the patent information or whose pending applications do not contain a valid certification at the time of submission
would be required to submit a certification as to that patent. (See &sect;&sect;314.50(i)(4) and 314.94(a)(12)(vi).)
While this could result in two categories of ANDA's for a pioneer drug, those without certifications for the late-filed
patent and those with certifications for that patent, this approach is the best means for discouraging manipulation
of the patent filing scheme and providing optimum notice of applicable patents. Disputes over patent issues arising
from this approach will be resolved by Federal courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the agency's opinion that this remedy may also prove suitable in certain instances when an NDA holder fails to
respond to an agency request for patent information within the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30-day period. It is a less severe sanction than withdrawing the approval of the NDA, but nonetheless effectuates
congressional intent to encourage timely filing and protect patent rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. One comment asked FDA to clarify supplemental patent certifications under proposed &sect;314.50(i)(6)(i).
The comment noted that the provision would have applicants submit new patent certifications if a patent were found
valid and infringed, but does not instruct applicants what to do if a patent is found to be infringed, but also invalid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has revised &sect;&sect;314.50(i)(6)(i) and 314.94(a)(12)(vii)(A) to state that an applicant does not have
to provide an amended patent certification if a court finds a patent to be invalid and infringed. FDA recognizes that
courts have the discretion to focus on patent infringement issues and not decide patent validity. However, court
decisions have also recognized the desirability of a court ruling on patent infringement even if the patent is held
invalid. (See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Medtronic, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 721 F.2d 1563 at 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1983).) (``Though an invalid claim cannot give rise to liability for infringement,
whether it is infringed is an entirely separate question capable of determination without regard to its validity.
Because both validity and infringement involve construction of a claim, and because the construction must be the
same in determining both, it is desirable to decide both questions at the same time.'') Moreover, in such instances,
the Supreme Court has indicated that ``of the two questions, validity has the greater public importance.'' (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sinclair &amp; Carroll Co. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Interchemical Corp
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 325 U.S. 327, 330 (1945).) Consequently, if a court finds a patent to be invalid and infringed, FDA will attach more
importance to the finding of invalidity, and will not require an amended patent certification even if the patent is
also found to be infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The agency, on its own initiative, has also revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(ii) regarding patent certifications
when a patent is removed from the list of patents for any reason other than a declaration of invalidity. Section 314.50(i)(6)(ii),
as proposed, would have required an applicant to certify that there are no patents that claim the drug or, if other relevant
patents claim the drug, to submit a request to withdraw the paragraph IV (patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will
not be infringed) certification. FDA has revised this section so that an applicant must certify that there are no patents
that claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, to provide an appropriate patent certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. On its own initiative, the agency has also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (now renumbered as &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(B)). As proposed, this provision would not require an applicant to
amend a patent certification ``when information on an otherwise applicable patent is submitted after the 505(b)(2)
application is approved, whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective.'' Because an approval
with a delayed effective date is tentative and is not final (see 57 FR 17950 at 17956), the agency has revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(B)
to require section 505(b)(2) applicants to amend their patent certifications until the effective date of approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. FDA received five comments on proposed &sect;314.50(j) and the applicant's obligations when claiming marketing
exclusivity for a product. One comment would change proposed &sect;314.50(j) to have an applicant submit exclusivity
information ``with'' its application rather than ``to'' its application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees, in part, with the comment. In general, applicants should submit exclusivity information with their NDA's.
If the NDA has been submitted, but has not been approved, the applicant should submit exclusivity information as an
amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.50(j)(3) to have an applicant state that, ``to the best of its knowledge
or belief, a drug has not been approved.'' The comment said proposed &sect;314.50(j)(3) would require applicants
to ``prove a negative'' because they would have to show that ``no drug has previously been approved under section 505(b)
of the act containing any active moiety in the drug for which the applicant is seeking approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has amended the rule accordingly.

13. Proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) contained a typographical error. As originally drafted, the provision interpreted
``new clinical investigations'' as a certification that, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, the clinical
investigations included in the application ``meet the definitions of `new' and `clinical investigations' set forth
in &sect;314.108(a).'' Proposed section 314.108(a), however, only defined ``new clinical investigation.'' The
agency has corrected &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) to refer to ``new clinical investigation.'' The agency has also replaced
the reference to ``the clinical investigations'' with ``each of the clinical investigations.'' This change is intended
to clarify that each clinical investigation, as opposed to some clinical investigations, must meet the definition
of a ``new clinical investigation'' in &sect;314.108. The agency has also made a minor grammatical change to &sect;314.50(j)(4)
to simplify its sentence structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) interpreted the phrase ``essential to approval'' as:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A list of all published studies or publicly available reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant through
a literature search that are relevant to the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval, a certification
that the applicant has thoroughly searched the scientific literature and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge,
the list is complete and accurate and, in the applicant's opinion, such published studies or publicly available reports
do not provide a sufficient basis for the approval of the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval without
reference to the new clinical investigation(s) in the application, and an explanation as to why the studies or reports
are insufficient.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments would revise proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) to have FDA declare whether a study is ``essential
to approval'' before the applicant begins the study or at the applicant's request. Another comment would consider
the agency's rejection of a suitability petition or ANDA as conclusive evidence that studies are ``essential to approval.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated elsewhere in this final rule, determining whether a study is essential for approval before a firm submits
an application or even begins the study is not always feasible. Research goals and objectives often change during
clinical investigations. Moreover, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, one cannot determine what studies
will be essential to approval of an application by a review of protocols without knowing what drugs have been approved
and what is in the published literature at the time the application is approved. If published reports of investigations,
other than those conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are sufficient to approve a drug product, no additional
studies would be essential to approval of that drug product as of the date of approval, and no exclusivity would be granted
(see 54 FR 28872 at 28900 and 28901). Thus, it is far more practical for FDA to decide whether a study is essential for
approval at the time the application is approved. FDA also believes that, if a pivotal study that could form the basis
for approval were published by someone other than the applicant after submission but before approval of the application,
there would be no exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also declines to treat its rejection of a suitability petition or ANDA as conclusive evidence that studies
are ``essential to approval.'' FDA may refuse to approve a suitability petition or ANDA for a variety of reasons. For
example, under 21 CFR 314.93(e)(1)(ii), the agency may not approve a suitability petition that seeks to change an
active ingredient if the drug product that is the subject of the petition is not a combination drug. Under 21 CFR 314.127(a),
the agency may refuse to approve an ANDA if the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,
processing, and packing of the drug product are inadequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality,
and purity. Thus, the agency's refusal to approve a suitability petition or ANDA does not necessarily mean that studies
conducted or sponsored by the applicant are ``essential to approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment also interpreted the terms ``scientific literature'' in proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) as literature
existing at the time the application was submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) only requires applicants to provide a list of all published studies or publicly
available reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant at the time the applicant submits the application.

B. Section 314.52_Notice of Certification of Invalidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Noninfringement of a Patent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.52 described the process whereby an applicant would provide notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of a patent. Proposed &sect;314.52(a) would have required applicants to provide notice to each
patent owner that is the subject of the certification and the holder of the approved application. Proposed &sect;314.52(b)
instructed applicants to provide notice after receipt of a letter from FDA stating that the application has been filed.
Proposed &sect;314.52(c)(6) specified the content of a notice, including a ``detailed statement of the factual
and legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed.'' Proposed &sect;314.52(d)
would have required an applicant who amended its application to contain a patent certification to provide notice
of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. Proposed &sect;314.52(e) would have required applicants
to document receipt of notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. FDA received two comments on proposed &sect;314.52(a). One comment agreed with the provision, but stated that
notice to the holder of the approved application should be considered only as informational ``with no legal ramifications
since the NDA holder has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
no
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 patent rights by reason of its NDA.'' (Emphasis added in original.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legal ramifications under patent law, if any, of this notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of a patent are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. One comment objected to proposed &sect;314.52(a)(3). The comment explained that the provision would permit
an applicant whose application did not cover any use claimed in a patent to refrain from making any patent certifications
or providing any notice. The comment would require all applicants to provide notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of a patent to all patent owners whose patents claim the active ingredient that is the subject of
the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 505(b)(2)(A) of the Act, an application must contain a certification with respect to each patent which
claims the listed drug or which claims a use for such listed drug for which the 505(b)(2) applicant is seeking approval.
One of these patent certifications is that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or
sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted. (See section 505(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act). If an applicant
makes a ``paragraph IV'' certification, it must give notice to the patent owner and the NDA holder. (See section 505(b)(3)(A)
of the Act.) If, however, the applicant is not seeking approval for a use that is covered by a use patent, the statute
does not require a ``paragraph IV'' certification or notice to that patent owner and NDA holder. (See section 505(b)(2)(B)
and (b)(2)(A) of the Act.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, &sect;314.52(a) is consistent with the statute, and FDA declines to revise it as suggested by the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. FDA received three comments on proposed &sect;314.52(c) regarding the content of a notice of certification of
invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. Two comments favored extremely detailed statements of the factual and
legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed. These comments would require
the applicant to list all components used in the proposed drug product, the proportions of each component, and list
all grounds supporting its opinion that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. One comment opposed disclosure
of the proposed drug product's formulation and also objected to the use of a ``designated intermediary'' in proposed
&sect;314.52(c)(6)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the statute requires a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent to state that
an application has been submitted and to include ``a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis of the applicant's
opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed.'' (See section 505(b)(3)(B) and 355(j)(2)(B)(ii).)
The proposed rule listed the type of information FDA considered necessary to enable patent owners to decide whether
to sue for patent infringement. The list at proposed &sect;&sect;314.52(c) and 314.95(c) generated substantial
debate, as reflected in the comments, as to the details to be included in a notice. The agency is neither prepared nor
required to become involved in issues concerning sufficiency of notice for purposes of enforcing patent law. Therefore,
FDA has revised both &sect;&sect;314.52(c) and 314.95(c) so that the detailed statement of the factual and legal
basis behind the applicant's opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed must include:
(1) For each claim of the patent alleged not to be infringed, a full and detailed explanation why the claim is not infringed;
and (2) for each claim of a patent alleged to be invalid or unenforceable, a full and detailed explanation of the grounds
supporting the allegation. These provisions, as revised, paraphrase the statutory language. The sufficiency of
the notice, for purposes of patent enforcement, is an issue to be resolved by the applicant and the patent owner or the
holder of the approved application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has also revised &sect;&sect;314.52(c)(6) and 314.95(c)(6) by removing paragraphs (c)(6)(iii) entirely.
FDA is making this change due to the numbers of comments that objected to the use of a ``designated intermediary'' and
the ``referee'' concept in proposed &sect;&sect;314.52 and 314.95. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.52(e) pertaining to documentation of receipt of notice of certification
of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. The comment would include a signed receipt or delivery manifest as documentation
of notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 314.52(e) clearly states that documentation of notice may be a copy of the return receipt or ``other similar
evidence of the date the notification was received.'' The provision also states that FDA will accept as adequate documentation
of the date of receipt a return receipt or ``a letter acknowledging receipt by the person provided the notice.'' Thus,
&sect;314.52(e) does not limit an applicant to a particular form of documentation of notice. Applicants are required,
however, to obtain agreement from FDA in advance if they intend to use a form of documentation other than return receipt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The agency has also revised &sect;314.52(f) to state that the 45-day period provided for in section 505(c)(3)(C)
of the Act will begin on the day following the date of receipt of the notice by the patent owner or its representative
and by the approved application holder. The reasons for this change are described in comment 62 below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency, on its own initiative, has also revised &sect;314.52(f) to state that the agency may begin the 45-day period
on a later date if the applicant has amended its application to state that a later date should be used. This could occur,
for example, where the applicant has amended its notice to the patent owner to provide more information regarding
the applicant's notice of invalidity or noninfringement. This revision is also consistent with the corresponding
provision for ANDA's.

C. Section 314.53_Submission of Patent Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.53 contained general requirements for the submission of patent information by NDA applicants
and NDA holders. For example, proposed &sect;314.53(b) would have required an NDA applicant to submit information
on each patent that claims the drug or drug product for which the applicant is seeking approval or a method of using the
drug that is the subject of the NDA or amendment or supplement and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement
could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or
sale of the drug product. Proposed &sect;314.53(c) described general reporting requirements, such as information
on the type of patent and the name of the patent owner, and also required applicants to submit ``certifications'' with
respect to formulation or composition patents (proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2)) and method of use patents (proposed
&sect;314.53(c)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. One comment addressed patent information and amendments of patent information under proposed &sect;&sect;314.50(h)
and 314.53. These provisions would require each application under section 505(b) of the act to contain specific information
about each patent that claimed the drug product or a method of using the drug product. The provisions also would require
applicants to amend patent information or patent certifications and would permit the agency to disclose patent information.
The comment said FDA should only publish patent information filed by NDA applicants at the time FDA approves the NDA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A drug product does not necessarily have a patent by the time FDA approves the NDA. The statute expressly recognizes
that a patent might issue after NDA approval, and, under such circumstances, instructs the NDA holder to file patent
information within 30 days of the patent's issue date. Once FDA receives this information, the agency is obliged to
publish it (see section 505(c)(2) of the act). Patent information might also change after NDA approval. For example,
the patent term restoration provisions at 35 U.S.C. 156 give patent holders the opportunity to extend patent terms.
The extended patent term may be as long as 5 years. However, patent owners cannot apply for patent term extension until
FDA approves the product for marketing (see 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1)). Thus, patent term restoration (also known as ``patent
term extension'') always occurs after NDA approval, and patent owners who obtain such extensions usually notify
FDA of the new patent expiration date. The new expiration date will be important to ANDA applicants because section
505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act requires ANDA applicants to submit patent certifications. Consequently, FDA does
not accept the comment's suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.53 to establish a mechanism ``for review of submitted patent information
to determine, at least on a very general basis, applicability to the particular NDA in question.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the comment. As stated elsewhere in this final rule, FDA does not have the expertise to review
patent information. The agency believes that its scarce resources would be better utilized in reviewing applications
rather than reviewing patent claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.53(b) by replacing the phrase, ``such patents consist of drug
(ingredient) patents'' with ``such patents consist of drug substance (ingredient) patents.'' The final rule also
replaces the phrase ``For patents that claim a drug or drug product'' with ``For patents that claim a drug substance
or drug product.'' These changes are intended to clarify the type of patents involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.53(b) by requiring an applicant to declare that it holds each patent
or is the exclusive licensee of the patent owner or is authorized to submit patent information on behalf of the patent
owner. The comment would also prohibit an applicant from submitting patent information and would prohibit the agency
from listing any patent information if the applicant did not make any of these declarations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to amend the provision. Under &sect;314.53(c), the applicant must provide the name of the patent
owner or, if the patent owner or applicant does not reside or have a place of business within the United States, the name
of an agent or representative who resides or maintains a place of business within the United States and is authorized
to receive notice of patent certification. Requiring an applicant to declare that it is the patent owner or exclusive
licensee or is authorized to submit patent information would go beyond the statutory language at section 505(b)(1)
of the act and would not serve any statutory purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to amend the rule to prohibit the applicant from submitting patent information or to prohibit the
agency from listing patent information without a declaration of ownership or license. Such an amendment would be
contrary to section 505(b)(1) of the act and may result in less published patent information, thereby causing applicants
to question the accuracy and validity of any patent information listed by FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. FDA received two comments that objected to proposed &sect;314.53(b) and (c) regarding the submission of patent
information by NDA applicants. Both comments claimed that the 1984 amendments only require NDA applicants to provide
patent numbers and patent expiration dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comments. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires an applicant to file ``the patent number and
the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application * * * and with
respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged
in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug.'' The requirement in &sect;314.53(b) and (c) that applicants provide
information on the type of patent and the name of the patent owner or authorized representative is consistent with
the purpose of section 505(b)(1) of the act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. One comment objected to proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) and (c)(3). Proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) would have required
an applicant to provide a patent certification for each formulation or composition patent in addition to certain,
general patent information. Proposed &sect;314.53(c)(3) would have required applicants to provide similar certifications
for method of use patents. The comment said that a patent may contain formulation, composition, and method of use claims.
The comment suggested deleting the proposed rule's classification of patents and replacing it with a general certification
that the patents listed by the applicant contain claims with respect to which the applicant could reasonably assert
a claim of infringement against a person engaged in the unlicensed manufacture, use, or sale of the drug for which the
application was submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA acknowledges that a patent may contain a variety of claims, and has revised proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) by creating
a single certification statement. The new certification statement would have an applicant state that, ``The undersigned
declares that Patent No. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 covers the formulation, composition, and/or method of use of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
name of drug product
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This product is (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
currently approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) [or] (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXXXXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' However, because section 505(b)(1) of the act specifically requires applicants to ``file with the application
the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the
application or which claims a method of using such drug,'' and because FDA lacks patent law expertise, the agency strongly
encourages applicants to identify, to the best of their ability, the type of patent covering the drug or drug product.
This information will help FDA determine which claims cover the drug or drug product and which claims cover a method
of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. One comment said FDA should not list formulation patents. Proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) would require applicants
under section 505(b) of the act to provide information on formulation or composition patents, and FDA would publish
this information under &sect;314.53(e). The comment said this would increase the number of generic drug applications
by avoiding difficult questions of exclusivity for ``patentably distinct formulations'' and noted that patent
owners can always resort to patent law to halt possible patent infringement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. The statute expressly requires applicants to file ``the patent number and the expiration
date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section
505(b)(1) of the act). Thus, if the formulation patent claimed the drug product in the application, the applicant
must file information on that patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2)(i), (c)(3)(i), and (c)(4) to refer to a ``declaration''
rather than ``certification.'' The comment explained that the 1984 amendments used the word ``certification''
with respect to patent information to be submitted by applicants under section 505(b)(2)(A) and (j)(2)(A)(vii)
of the act, so use of the word ``certification'' in proposed &sect;314.53(c) would be confusing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees and has revised these and other sections of the rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. One comment would delete proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii). The comment said that the provision
for the correction of patent information at proposed &sect;314.53(f) would ensure that patent information is correct.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions cited by the comment serve different purposes. As revised, &sect;314.53(c)(2)(ii) requires an applicant
to provide patent information about a product within 30 days after the date of approval; these provisions contemplate
the possibility that the patents pertaining to a product's formulation, composition, and uses may change between
the time the application is initially submitted and the time the application is approved (see 54 FR 28872 at 28909).
Although &sect;314.53(f) enables any person to dispute the accuracy or relevance of the patent information submitted
to FDA, it is the responsibility of the applicant, not the general public or the applicant's competitors, to ensure
that the information provided by the applicant is accurate. These provisions for amending patent information are
necessary for maintaining an accurate list of patent information and useful for applicants who must comply with the
patent certification requirements. Therefore, FDA declines to adopt the comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. FDA received two comments on proposed &sect;314.53(c)(4) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(c)(3)), which would
enable an applicant to claim that there are no relevant patents that claim the drug product or a method of using the drug
product. One comment supported the provision; the other recommended deleting it entirely, stating that the only
party that would be injured by the failure to list a patent is the NDA applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to delete the provision as suggested. The agency disagrees with the assertion that the NDA applicant
would be the only party injured by the failure to list a patent. The patent holder may be a person other than the NDA applicant
and may be injured if the patented invention is made, sold, or used without the patent owner's knowledge or consent.
Failure to list a patent may also result in injury to other applicants who devote resources towards submitting applications
for duplicate products without realizing that those products may be covered by the patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. FDA, on its own initiative, has reorganized &sect;314.53(d) to clarify further when and where patent information
should be submitted. As revised, &sect;314.53(d)(1) pertains to patent information requirements for original
applications. New &sect;314.53(d)(2), formerly &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii), applies to patent information requirements
for supplements, and a new &sect;314.53(d)(3), formerly &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i), applies to patent information
submitted after an application has been approved. The agency has renumbered the remaining paragraphs accordingly.

32. Proposed &sect;314.53(d) instructed applicants when and where to submit patent information in an original application
and in a supplement and would require an applicant to provide patent information within 30 days if a patent issues for
a drug, drug product, or method of use after the application had been approved. Three comments asked FDA to extend the
30-day period in proposed &sect;314.53(d) to 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comment. The 30-day period is consistent with section 505(c)(2) of the act and permits the
agency to include the latest patent information in supplements to the Orange Book. If FDA provided for a longer time
period, the Orange Book and its supplements might be less likely to contain current patent information for each product,
and potential applicants might be misled by outdated patent information. FDA has, on its own initiative, clarified
&sect;314.53(d)(1) and (d)(3) to mention the 30-day deadline.

33. Proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)) would require an applicant to submit
patent information for a patent that claims the drug, drug product, or a method of using the product if the applicant
sought approval of certain, listed changes through a supplemental application. One comment would revise proposed
&sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii) to require an applicant to provide a patent declaration for each supplement. The comment
explained that this would ``eliminate the risk that the four types of supplements described in the proposal do not
comprise the entire universe of supplements that may affect the patent information filed with the FDA.'' The comment
would also require an NDA applicant to submit information on patents that claim the formulation or composition each
time the NDA applicant submits a supplement to revise the formulation or composition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires an applicant to submit information on each patent
that claims the drug or a method of using a drug product for which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be
asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug. The supplements
listed in new &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)_supplements to change a formulation, to add a new indication or other condition
of use, to change the strength, or to make any other patented change regarding the drug, drug product, or any method
of use_are those that concern the drug product or a method of using the drug product. Additionally, new &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(D)
provides for the submission of patent information for any other type of patented change. Requiring an applicant to
provide patent information for all supplements, even if the supplement did not involve a change to the drug product
or a method of using the product (i.e., a change in the site of manufacturing), would increase the workload on applicants
and the agency without a significant benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestion that FDA require an applicant to submit information on patents that claim the formulation or composition
each time the NDA applicant submits a supplement to revise the formulation or composition is apparently based on a
misreading of proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii)(A) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(A)). This section
already requires an applicant to provide such information. Thus, the comment's suggestion is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii)(D) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(D))
to require the submission of patent information if the applicant submits a supplement to make any other patented change
``except patented manufacturing processes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggested revision is unnecessary because &sect;314.53(b) clearly states that, ``Process patents are not covered
by [&sect;314.53] and information on process patents may not be submitted to FDA.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. One comment would delete proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(v) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(iv)), which
would require an applicant to comply with the requirements for amending formulation, composition, or method of use
patent information. The comment said applicants are already required to comply with such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. Section 314.53(d)(2)(iv) requires applicants to amend the patent information to
account for changes proposed in supplemental applications whereas &sect;314.53(c)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(ii) require
an applicant to amend patent information when there have been changes in status, or there is other new information
regarding the relevant patents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. Proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(4)) would require an applicant to submit two
copies of each submission of patent information. One copy would go to the archival copy of the application and the other
copy would go to the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the review copy. One comment would delete the
phrase ``of the review copy'' from proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3) on the grounds that the phrase appeared to be a typographical
error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment misreads proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3). An applicant is required to submit an archival
copy and a review copy of an application consisting of several separately bound technical sections. New &sect;314.53(d)(4)
requires an applicant to provide two copies of each submission of patent information. One copy will go to the archival
copy of the NDA; the other will go to the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls technical section of the review copy
of the NDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.53(e) regarding public disclosure of patent information.
As originally proposed, &sect;314.53(e) stated that, for each use patent, FDA would publish the ``approved indications
or other conditions of use covered by a patent and any unapproved indications or condition of use to which the applicant
certified.'' The agency is deleting the reference to ``any unapproved indications or condition of use'' to be consistent
with the patent information requirements in &sect;314.53(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38. FDA received two comments on proposed &sect;314.53(f) regarding corrections of patent information errors.
The proposed provision would require a person disputing the accuracy or relevance of patent information submitted
to and published by FDA to first notify the agency in writing stating the grounds for the disagreement. The agency would
then ask the NDA holder to confirm whether the patent information was correct, but would not change the patent information
listed in the Orange Book unless the NDA holder withdrew or amended that information. If the NDA holder did not change
the patent information, a 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant would be required to make a certification for the
listed patent despite any disagreement as to its correctness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both comments said that FDA should ensure that patent information submitted to the agency is complete and applies
to a particular NDA. One comment would also amend the rule to have FDA confirm, upon request from any person, the accuracy
or relevance of the patent information submitted to the agency. One comment said the agency should not provide applicants
the grounds for a disagreement on the accuracy or relevance of patent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated elsewhere in this rule, FDA does not have the resources or the expertise to review patent information for
its accuracy and relevance to an NDA. Therefore, the agency declines the comment's requests to ensure that patent
information is complete and relevant to an NDA and to confirm, upon request, the validity of patent information submitted
to the agency. The agency believes that the declaration requirements under &sect;314.53(c), as well as an applicant's
potential liability if it submits an untrue statement of material fact, will help ensure that accurate patent information
is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to amend the rule to prevent the agency from providing applicants the grounds for a disagreement
on the accuracy or relevance of patent information. Absent such information, a patent owner will be unable to evaluate
the disagreement or to explain whether the patent information is correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. One comment noted that proposed &sect;314.53(f) does not require applicants to correct patent listings. The
comment would revise the provision to permit applicants to ``make otherwise pertinent certifications while a listing
dispute is pending.'' The comment would also require FDA to notify the NDA holder of the disagreement within 15 days
of notification and require patent owners or NDA holders to respond to a disagreement on patent information or to withdraw
or amend the patent information within 30 days. The comment would then require FDA to immediately send the NDA holder's
response to the party that began the disagreement and inform the party whether the patent would remain listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As originally proposed, &sect;314.53(f) expressly required an applicant to make ``an appropriate certification
for each listed patent'' notwithstanding any disagreement as to the correctness of the listed patent information.
If, as FDA assumes, the proposed reference to ``otherwise pertinent certifications'' means ``appropriate certifications,''
the proposal is unnecessary. If the proposed reference is to negate any responsibility to file an appropriate certification
for a patent that is subject to a dispute over listing, FDA rejects the proposal. Until the dispute is resolved, the
patent is listed within the meaning of the act. FDA also declines to amend the rule to impose deadlines for resolving
patent disagreements. The agency believes that such deadlines would be impractical, considering the agency's lack
of expertise in patent matters and the volume of applications FDA receives, and agency resources would be better spent
on reviewing applications rather than exchanging disputed patent information among parties as proposed by the comment.
The agency also notes that it has not had any significant problems with the informal procedures described in proposed
&sect;314.53(f) as most NDA holders have amended or corrected their patent information after FDA has informed them
of a dispute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has, however, revised &sect;314.53(f) to provide a new address for the submission of written statements
disputing the relevance or accuracy of patent information. Such statements should now be directed to the Drug Information
Services Branch in the Division of Drug Information Resources. This change reflects current FDA operations.

F. Section 314.94_Content and Format of an Abbreviated Application (21 CFR 314.94)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12) contained the patent certification requirements for ANDA's. For example, under
proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i), an ANDA applicant would provide a patent certification with respect to each patent
that claims the reference listed drug or that claims a use of the reference listed drug for which the ANDA applicant
is seeking approval. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) would permit an ANDA applicant to certify that there are
no relevant patents that claim the listed drug or a method of use of the listed drug. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii)
would permit an ANDA applicant to state that the use for which the applicant is seeking approval is not covered by a patent
claiming a use for the listed drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. One comment claimed that proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A) was inconsistent with the statute because the
statute only requires ANDA applicants to make certifications for listed patents rather than patents issued by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. Two comments added that the suggestion regarding patent searches that
FDA made in the preamble to the proposed rule was irrational and legally insupportable. One company, however, agreed
that ANDA applicants should submit patent certifications with respect to all patents, including those that had not
been submitted to FDA for listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule simply paraphrases the statutory language in section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act. The rule does not require
ANDA applicants to conduct patent searches. If the applicant believes that no patent exists, the applicant is to submit
a patent certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) that no relevant patents exist. If the applicant believes
that a patent exists but that the patent owner has not filed patent information at FDA, the ANDA applicant would certify
that, ``in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge,'' no patent information has been submitted (i.e., make a paragraph
I certification). FDA, however, believes it would be prudent for applicants to conduct patent searches if possible.
A patent search could reveal the existence of an unlisted, but valid, patent and thus prevent an unnecessary expenditure
of resources by applicants and FDA on a product that might not be marketable. A patent search might also enable ANDA
applicants to avoid unnecessary patent infringement litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. One comment suggested that FDA publish all patent information, including descriptions of the patents and patent
numbers, in the Orange Book. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Orange Book already contains an addendum listing both patent and exclusivity information. This section provides
patent numbers and patent expiration dates as well as exclusivity codes and expiration dates. In addition, for a use
patent, FDA includes in the Orange Book a code identifying the indication covered by the patent. As for patent descriptions,
FDA lacks the expertise to review and summarize patents and individual patent claims and does not believe that expanding
the Orange Book to include patent descriptions would be an efficient use of FDA resources. However, persons who wish
to obtain a synopsis of a particular patent can consult the Official Gazette for Patents, which is published by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Official Gazette for Patents contains short descriptions of patents
and is publicly available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. One comment asserted that FDA should list patents that claim drug products for which the patent owner is not seeking
or has not obtained approval. The comment explained that the statute requires NDA holders and applicants to submit
information on ``any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application'' (section 505(b)(1)
of the act). The comment, citing &sect;314.50(d)(1), claimed that ``drug'' means the active ingredient while ``drug
product'' denotes a marketed product composed of active and inactive ingredients. Thus, because section 505(b)(1)
of the act uses the term ``drug,'' the comment continued, any patent that claims the active ingredient is a patent that
claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application and should be listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment's interpretation of section 505(b)(1) of the act. The statutory provision states
that patent information is to be filed on patents that claim the drug ``for which the applicant submitted the application.''
Similarly, the House Report accompanying the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act indicates that
the patent information to be filed ``includes the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims
the drug 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in the NDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted *&blank;*&blank;*.'' H. Rept.
857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 31&hyph;32 (1984) (emphasis added). Thus, both the statute and its legislative history
reveal that Congress intended the term ``drug'' to mean ``drug product'' rather than ``active ingredient'' because
NDA's are granted only for drug products and not for active ingredients. FDA's interpretation of this provision has
been upheld by a United States magistrate in

43. Several comments sought clarification regarding the interaction between proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v), 180-day exclusivity periods under section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act, and licensees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because patent licensees are subject to 180-day exclusivity that has been granted to another applicant, the only
instance in which proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) would apply would be where a patent licensee would seek to have
an effective approval of its ANDA or 505(b)(2) application within 45 days of its receipt or filing (because the patent
holder has 45 days to file a lawsuit against an ANDA applicant making a paragraph IV certification). Because the agency
does not anticipate approving an ANDA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
505(b)(2) application in 45 days, FDA, on its own initiative, removed the provisions in &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v)
and &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv) related to consent by a patent owner to an immediate effective date of approval for a
licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. Two comments disagreed with proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii), which would require ANDA applicants to certify
that there are no relevant patents that claim the listed drug referred to in the ANDA. One comment said that ANDA applicants
should only be required to certify that no listed patents claim the listed drug referred to in the ANDA. The second comment
suggested deleting the provision and revising proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) so ANDA applicants would certify that no patent information had been filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comments. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, an applicant makes a patent certification
under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) if ``in the applicant's opinion and to the best of its knowledge, no relevant patents
claim the listed drug or a method of using the listed drug'' (54 FR 28872 at 28885). The applicant makes the patent certifications
under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i) when it is aware of or believes that a patent covers the listed drug. (Id.) FDA believes
that &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) will enable FDA to ensure that each applicant has complied with the patent certification
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
45. One comment asked FDA to define ``relevant'' for proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii). The word ``relevant'' refers
to those patents defined by section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act for which a patent certification would be required,
i.e., patents that claim the listed drug, or drug substance component thereof, referred to in the ANDA or that claim
a use of the listed drug or drug substance for which the ANDA applicant seeks approval and for which patent information
is required to be filed under section 505 (b) and (c) of the act and &sect;314.53. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although patents that are held to be invalid or unenforceable in a judicial decision may be removed from the list by
FDA, a patent that has been declared invalid or unenforceable in a lawsuit resulting in 180-day exclusivity will be
deemed relevant under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) and will not be removed from the list until the end of the 180-day exclusivity
period. This will ensure that 180-day exclusivity cannot be avoided by changing a patent certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46. Several comments objected to proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii), which would require ANDA applicants to provide
a patent statement if the listed patent is for a method of use and that applicant does not intend to claim any of the patented
uses. The comments recommended that such ANDA applicants certify, under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), that the listed use patent would not be infringed, thereby giving the patent owner notice of possible patent infringement.
One comment asked how proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii) would affect eligibility for the 180-day exclusivity
period. The comment explained that the statute requires ANDA applicants to make patent certifications under section
505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act and statements for method of use patents under section 505(j)(2)(A)(viii) of the act.
However, the comment stated, for method of use patents, the proposed rule could be interpreted as giving ANDA applicants
the option of making a patent certification of noninfringement under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or a statement that the applicants' drug products do not involve a patented claim under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not intend &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to authorize certifications with respect to patents that claim a use for the listed drug for which the applicant is
not seeking approval. The statute requires patent certifications only if the patent ``claims a use for [the] listed
drug for which the applicant is seeking approval *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act). The
statute requires an applicant to make a patent statement when a method of use patent ``does not claim a use for which
the applicant is seeking approval *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 505(j)(2)(A)(viii) of the act).) The proposed
rule recognized this distinction. FDA stated that if a patent claims a method of using the listed drug, and labeling
for the ANDA applicant's proposed drug product does not contain any indications covered by the method of use patent,
the ANDA applicant ``should not submit a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A) for such a patent'' (54
FR 28872 at 28886). The preamble also indicated that if the labeling for the ANDA applicant's product did contain an
indication that was claimed by a patent, the applicant should make a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A).
(Id.) Thus, the two provisions cited by the comment are not overlapping, and an applicant does not have the option of
making a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in lieu of, or in addition to, a statement under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, there are listed patents that present both a product and method of use claim, the applicant may file a paragraph
IV certification with respect to the product patent or patent claim and a statement that the product that is the subject
of the application does not involve a patented method of use with respect to the method of use patent or patent claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
47. One comment recommended revising proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) to provide NDA holders the opportunity to
consent to licensing agreements between ANDA applicants and patent owners. As written, proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v)
did not address this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the statute nor the legislative history suggests that NDA holders should be given such a right, and the agency
is not prepared to infer such a right to interfere in the patent holder's enjoyment of its right to license. However,
as stated earlier, FDA has elected to remove the language in &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) regarding consent by the patent
owner.

48. One comment objected, in part, to proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vi), which would require an ANDA applicant to
provide a patent certification in response to an untimely submission of patent information if the ANDA was submitted
after the untimely submission of patent information or did not contain an appropriate patent certification at the
time the patent information was submitted. The comment correctly noted that FDA may refuse to approve or may even withdraw
approval of an application for failure to submit patent information (see section 505 (d)(6) and (e)(4) of the act).
The comment said these sanctions emphasize the importance of filing patent information, and FDA ``should not provide
any benefit to the NDA applicant who ignores the statutory requirement for timely submission of such information.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 314.94(a)(12)(vi) is intended to effectuate Congress' intent to enforce timely submission of patent information.
As discussed more fully in the response to comment 7 above, FDA believes a less severe sanction than the withdrawal
of NDA approval for late submission of patent information would ordinarily effectuate congressional intent. For
the reasons discussed in response to comment 7 FDA has concluded that if an NDA applicant submits required patent information
on an approved drug product more than 30 days after issuance of the patent, the agency will publish the untimely information
but will not require ANDA applicants with pending applications who have previously submitted a certification that
was correct at the time it was submitted, i.e., those applicants who would be prejudiced by the late submission, to
recertify as to the new patent. Applicants who initially submit ANDA's after the submission of the patent information
or whose pending applications do not contain a valid certification at the time of the submission would be required
to submit a certification as to that patent. The agency, therefore, declines to revise this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that, if an ANDA applicant with a pending application voluntarily makes a patent certification for
an untimely filed patent, the ANDA applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed patent.
The agency, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii) to make this clear. Additionally, if the
patent certification for the untimely filed patent was a paragraph IV certification (claiming that the patent is
invalid or would not be infringed), the agency would not consider the withdrawn paragraph IV certification to preclude
FDA from granting 180-day exclusivity to another ANDA applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vii) would permit an ANDA applicant to seek confirmation of the correctness of
patent information, but would also require an ANDA applicant to submit the appropriate patent certification if the
disputed patent information was not amended or withdrawn. One comment suggested amending proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vii)
to declare the end of the error correction process for patent information to be final agency action. The comment explained
that this section permits challenges to listed patents but, in conjunction with proposed &sect;314.53(f), neglects
to contain a process to require patent owners to withdraw or modify patent listings. The comment said that declaring
the end of the error correction process to be final agency action would enable ANDA applicants to seek judicial review
rather than wait for the patent owner to voluntarily correct the patent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. Disputes between ANDA applicants and patent holders regarding the validity or correctness
of the listed patent information must be resolved among the ANDA applicants and the patent holders rather than by agency
action. FDA stated this position in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 54 FR 28872 at 28910). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50. One comment addressed proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii) and asked FDA to permit applicants to amend their
patent certifications if a patent is declared invalid. The comment proposed that any amendment, with the exception
of a paragraph IV certification being changed to a paragraph III certification, be considered nunc pro tunc (now for
then). If a patent were declared invalid, the comment suggested that an amendment from paragraph IV to paragraph III
be considered ``as if a III were originally filed, subject to a prior IV certificant's exclusivity rights during the
remaining lifetime of the patent.'' Finally, the comment said that applicants should be permitted to make a paragraph
I certification if the patent were removed from the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees in part with the comment. An applicant may change its certification at any time. Although there is no need
for the agency to pronounce such changes in certification nunc pro tunc, the agency agrees that the protection offered
by 180-day exclusivity should not be undermined by changes from paragraph IV certification or by the filing of original
certifications other than paragraph IV certifications. If a patent were removed from the list immediately upon a
court decision that the patent is invalid or unenforceable, an applicant with a subsequently filed application might
seek to certify that there is no relevant patent and seek an immediately effective approval. To ensure that this does
not occur, the agency has required that a patent remain on the list after being declared invalid or unenforceable until
the end of any applicable 180-day exclusivity period. This means that a patent is deemed to be relevant under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii)
until the end of the term of the patent or applicable 180-day exclusivity period, whichever occurs first. Thus, where
there is a patent that has been challenged by a paragraph IV applicant, a subsequent applicant will not be able to file
a certification that there is no relevant patent or seek an immediately effective approval until either the patent
or the 180-day exclusivity period expires. The agency has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(B) and made a similar
change to &sect;314.50(i)(6)(ii) to reflect this position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also notes that an applicant may withdraw its patent certification at any time. However, as stated earlier,
if an ANDA applicant made a paragraph IV certification and later withdraws that certification, the agency will not
regard the withdrawn paragraph IV certification as precluding the agency from granting 180-day exclusivity to a
subsequent ANDA applicant.

51. One comment suggested that ANDA applicants amend their patent certifications to a paragraph I certification
if FDA or the NDA holder ``delists'' a patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency believes that a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii),
stating that no relevant patents claim the listed drug, would be more appropriate if a patent is ``delisted'' (see
54 FR 28872 at 28886). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52. One comment asked FDA to clarify proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(A) so that an amended patent certification
would be required if a patent were held valid and infringed but not required if a patent were held infringed, but not
valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a claim is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the patent will ordinarily be removed from the list, and applicants
with pending applications containing certifications with respect to that patent must amend their certifications
accordingly to certify that no relevant patents claim the drug or, if another relevant patent claims the drug, to make
an appropriate certification regarding that patent. In the amendment, the applicant must state the reason for the
change in certification (that the patent has been removed from the list). A patent that is the subject of a lawsuit under
&sect;314.107(c) will not be removed from the list until FDA determines either that no delay in effective dates of
approval is required as a result of the lawsuit or that any such period of delay in effective dates of approval is ended.
The agency has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(B) to clarify its position regarding certifications and patents
removed from the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also advises applicants to submit any patent certification changes by letter if the applicant has not received
a ``not approvable'' letter from the agency. If the applicant has received a ``not approvable'' letter, it may include
the amended certification along with the complete response to the deficiencies in the ``not approvable'' letter.
This will enable FDA to process amendments more efficiently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
53. Six comments addressed amended certifications under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) which would not require applicants to amend their patent certifications when patent information is submitted after
the abbreviated application's approval ``whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective.''
One comment would require amended patent certifications only if a new patent issued after the ANDA had been submitted
and make supplements optional after ANDA approval. Five comments would require ANDA applicants to amend patent certifications
until the effective date of their ANDA approvals because the existence of a patent would affect the ANDA's effective
date of approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 28, 1992 (57 FR 17950 at 17953), FDA stated that it had clarified its policies with respect to drug products
with delayed effective dates of approval. The agency stated that an approval with a delayed effective date is tentative
and does not become final until the effective date. Therefore, FDA has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by deleting the phrase ``whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective,'' and, consistent
with this change, and in response to the comments, by requiring an ANDA applicant to amend its patent certifications
until the effective date of ANDA approval.

G. Section 314.95_Notice of Certification of Invalidity or Noninfringement of a Patent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.95 described an ANDA applicant's obligations with respect to a notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of a patent. Proposed &sect;314.95(a), for example, would require an ANDA applicant to provide
notice to the patent owner and the NDA holder. Proposed &sect;314.95(b) would require an ANDA applicant to send the
notice when it receives an acknowledgment letter from FDA stating that the ANDA is sufficiently complete for review
to begin. Proposed &sect;314.95(c) prescribed the contents of a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of a patent, including ``a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent
is not valid or will not be infringed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54. One comment recommended that FDA revise the regulation by adding a mechanism whereby FDA or the United States Patent
and Trademark Office would review notices of certification of invalidity or noninfringement. The comment would
have FDA suspend the 45-day period provided by section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act until FDA or the United States
Patent and Trademark Office determined that the notice was sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the comment. As stated elsewhere in this preamble, FDA lacks expertise in patent law. Moreover,
neither FDA nor the United States Patent and Trademark Office currently has access to the additional resources that
would be necessary to review these notices, and a patent certification review system would subject the agency's decisions
to questioning that would require further resource expenditures and create delays in the statutory patent certification
and challenge process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency does note, however, that in cases where the notice was deemed inadequate by the patent owner or exclusive
patent licensee and where the ANDA applicant subsequently amends the notice, the agency may, if the applicant amends
its ANDA with a written statement that the date of receipt of the amended notification should be considered the date
of receipt of notice, use the date of the amended notification to begin the 45-day statutory period for institution
of an action for patent infringement (see 54 FR 28872 at 28888; see also &sect;314.95(f)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55. Two comments addressed return receipts under proposed &sect;314.95(a). One comment would amend the rule to provide
for signed receipts while the second would revise the rule to permit reliance on ``any appropriate federal rule for
transmitting notice to another party or for receipt of such notice.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;314.95(e), applicants are required to document receipt of a notice of invalidity or noninfringement
by submitting ``a copy of the return receipt or other similar evidence of the date the notification was received.''
The rule states that FDA will accept return receipts, letters acknowledging receipt by the person provided the notice,
or ``another form of documentation only if FDA has agreed to such documentation in advance.'' Thus, the rule provides
several methods for documenting receipt of a notice, so the comment's recommendations are unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. One comment asked FDA to clarify when multiple notices might be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 314.95(a) requires applicants to send notices to each patent owner and each holder (or its attorney, agent,
or other authorized official) of the approved application under section 505(b) of the act for the listed drug that
is claimed by the patent and for which the applicant is seeking approval (&sect;314.95 (a)(1) and (a)(2)). Consequently,
applicants could be obliged to send multiple notices under several situations. For example, a patent owner is usually
an individual whereas the holder of an approved application is often a corporation. The applicant, therefore, would
send one notice to the patent owner and another to the firm holding the approved application. If several patents cover
the listed drug, there may be several different patent owners, so the applicant would be required to provide separate
notices to each patent owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57. Two comments suggested revising proposed &sect;314.95(a)(1) to include the patent owner's name and address
in the Orange Book. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The patent owner's name and address are printed on each patent. As a result, whenever a prospective applicant examines
a patent to determine whether its proposed product would infringe any of the patent claims, the applicant would have
access to the patent owner's name and address. The comment's suggestion, therefore, is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58. Several comments asked when and how applicants should send notices under proposed &sect;314.95(b). Two comments
would have an applicant provide a statement to FDA declaring that the applicant ``will give,'' rather than ``has provided,''
notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. These comments explained that the statute
does not specify a time for the notice, so the rule should permit applicants to decide when to send such notices. One
comment would revise the rule to give FDA 30 days to determine whether the ANDA was complete before the applicant would
be required to send a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history discussing a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent clearly
states that ANDA applicants should provide notice ``simultaneously with the submission of an ANDA'' and that Congress
did ``not intend that applicants be permitted to circumvent this notice requirement by filing sham ANDA's or ANDA's
which are substantially incomplete'' (see H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 24 (1984)). Thus, to permit applicants
to state that they ``will provide'' notice to the patent owner and holder of the approved application would be contrary
to congressional intent. Moreover, such a statement would be redundant relative to that required under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)
and would not inform FDA whether notice has, in fact, been provided. With regard to the suggestion of a 30-day deadline
for FDA to respond before an applicant sends notice, FDA believes such a requirement would be impractical. The time
required to review an application may vary depending upon the application's complexity, the review division's workload,
the timing and scope of an applicant's response to FDA's questions or requests, etc. Although FDA intends to review
applications expeditiously, current resources and priorities may not, in all instances, enable the agency to determine
whether an application is sufficiently complete for review to begin within 30 days after receiving the application.
Consequently, FDA declines to adopt the comments.

59. One comment argued that proposed &sect;314.95(b) creates a delay that is detrimental to ANDA applicants and is
contrary to the 1984 amendments and the legislative history. The comment said that proposed &sect;314.95(b) would
deprive ANDA applicants of ``statutory rights'' associated with the 45-day period and the 30-month period for the
effective date of an ANDA approval and could present problems among competing ANDA applicants. The comment said FDA
should permit ANDA applicants to provide notice upon submission of an application or have ANDA applicants await an
initial FDA determination (presumably as to whether the application is received) before providing notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. As stated above, the legislative history expressly states that notice of certification
of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent must be given simultaneously with the submission of an ANDA and that the
ANDA cannot be a ``sham'' ANDA or one that is substantially incomplete (see H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 24 (1984)).
As written, &sect;314.95(b) is consistent with the legislative history because it requires the ANDA applicant to
provide notice once FDA has determined that the ANDA is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. To
permit an ANDA applicant to provide notice before FDA has determined whether the ANDA is sufficiently complete would
be contrary to the legislative history because it would only encourage ANDA applicants to file incomplete or ``sham''
ANDA's and to supplement them later to secure a place in the review queue in an attempt to secure the first ANDA approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. FDA received five comments regarding the exact contents of a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of a patent. Two comments would revise the rule to require applicants to disclose all components, including active
and inactive ingredients, in the applicant's prospective formulation, the proportions of those components, and
all grounds supporting the applicant's assertion that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. Three comments
opposed disclosure of the applicant's formulation or composition information or a detailed statement of the applicant's
legal reasoning. These comments explained that such information and statements might compromise the applicant's
trade secrets and adversely affect the applicant's ability to engage in litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above in comment 18, the agency did not anticipate that the list in proposed &sect;314.95(c) would generate
the debate reflected in the comments and, again, reiterates that the agency does not have the expertise or the desire
to become involved in issues concerning patent law and sufficiency of notice. Therefore, FDA has revised &sect;314.95
to require that the detailed statement of the factual and legal basis behind the applicant's opinion that the patent
is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed include the following: (1) For each claim of a patent alleged not
to be infringed, a full and detailed explanation why the claim is not infringed; and (2) for each claim of a patent alleged
to be invalid or unenforceable, a full and detailed explanation of the grounds supporting the allegation (see &sect;&sect;314.52(c)(6)(i)
and (c)(6)(ii) and 314.95(c)(6)(i) and (c)(6)(ii)). Disputes involving the sufficiency of the notice must be resolved
by the applicant, patent owner, and holder of the approved application rather than by action on the part of FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. FDA also received five comments opposing the use of a referee or designated intermediary under proposed &sect;314.95(c)(6)(iii).
The proposal would have required an ANDA applicant to describe a mechanism for disclosing the formulation or composition
of the proposed drug product to the patent owner or to a ``designated intermediary who will act as a referee'' on the
subject of patent invalidity or noninfringement. The comments said that the concept was legally unauthorized and
interfered with the traditional judicial process for resolving patent disputes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that traditional processes for resolving patent disputes, which do not involve the agency's regulations,
are appropriate under these circumstances. Therefore, the agency has deleted the provision in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
62. Proposed &sect;314.95(f) would presume a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement to be complete
and sufficient if the ANDA applicant complied with the regulatory requirements under &sect;314.95(a) through (e)
and would start the 45-day clock for filing a patent infringement suit on the date following receipt of the notice.
One comment challenged the presumption that a notice is complete and sufficient to permit the statutory 45-day period
to begin. The comment would revise the rule to require applicants to file a complete copy of the certification and notice
of service with FDA and delay the start of the 45-day period if any dispute over the certification's sufficiency arose.
A second comment argued that an approved application holder who is also an exclusive patent licensee might have different
interests than the patent owner. The comment would revise the rule to require notice to both the patent owner and to
the licensee or approved application holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to FDA's presumption that a notice is complete and sufficient to begin the 45-day period, &sect;314.95(c),
as amended, paraphrases the statutory language concerning notices and does not attempt to establish more detailed
requirements for ``sufficiency'' of a notice. FDA has revised &sect;314.95(f) to state that it will begin the 45-day
period on the first day after the documented date of receipt by the person(s) receiving the notice. FDA will be able
to determine this date because &sect;314.95(e) requires applicants to submit documentation of receipt of notice.
FDA may, if the applicant amends its ANDA with a written statement that a later date should be used, count from the later
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also agrees that an exclusive patent licensee's interests may differ from those of the patent owner. Therefore,
FDA has revised &sect;&sect;314.52(f) and 314.95(f) to start the 45-day period on the day following the date of receipt
of the notice by the patent owner or its representative and by the approved application holder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
63. The agency, on its own initiative, is revising &sect;314.101(e) to add a new paragraph stating that the agency
will refuse to file a 505(b)(2) application or receive an ANDA if the drug product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2)
application or ANDA is protected by a 5-year exclusivity period under section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii)
of the act. This amendment is consistent with the statutory language and &sect;314.108(b)(2).

I. Section 314.107_Effective Date of Approval of a 505(b)(2) Application or Abbreviated New Drug Application Under
Section 505(j) of the Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.107 was intended to codify the requirements under section 505(c)(3) and (j)(4) of the act regarding
the effective dates of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA. For example, if the 505(b)(2) applicant or
ANDA applicant certified that there are no relevant patents, that patent information has not been submitted, that
the patent has expired, or that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the patent owner has not
brought suit for patent infringement, proposed &sect;314.107(b)(1) would treat the date FDA issues an approval
letter as the effective date of approval. If the 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant certified that the patent would
expire on a specific date, proposed &sect;314.107(b)(2) would treat that specific date as the effective date of approval.
Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3) described several situations in which the effective date of approval could vary,
depending upon the disposition of patent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;314.107 also implemented the ``180-day exclusivity period'' described in section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv)
of the act. In brief, section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act states that if an ANDA contains a paragraph IV patent certification
(declaring the patent to be invalid or not infringed) and the ANDA is for a drug for which a previous ANDA containing
a paragraph IV patent certification has been submitted, approval of the subsequently submitted ANDA will be made
effective 180 days after the date FDA receives from the previous ANDA applicant notice of the first commercial marketing
of the drug or the date a court holds the patent that is the subject of the patent certification to be invalid or not infringed,
whichever date is earlier (see section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act). Proposed &sect;314.107(c) provided that an
applicant must be the first ANDA applicant to submit a substantially complete application with a paragraph IV certification
and must have been sued for patent infringement in order to qualify for 180-day exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. One comment asked FDA to permit any person to contact FDA informally to determine whether the listed patent information
was correct and later petition the agency to correct any errors. As proposed, &sect;314.107 did not provide for inquiries
concerning patent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 314.53(f) and 314.94(a)(12)(vii) describe the procedures that an applicant can use to question the validity
of patent information. In brief, if an applicant disputes the accuracy or relevance of patent information, it should
first notify FDA in writing and state the reasons for the disagreement. FDA will then request that the relevant NDA
holder confirm the validity of the patent information, but will not change the patent information itself unless the
NDA holder withdraws or amends the patent information. The agency believes that these procedures for determining
the validity of patent information are sufficient, and, therefore, declines to adopt the change suggested by the
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.107(b)(1) to state that an approval will become effective on
the date FDA issues an approval letter except as provided under paragraphs (b)(3), pertaining to approvals resulting
from the disposition of patent litigation; (b)(4), pertaining to approvals where an applicant has submitted multiple
certifications; and (c), regarding subsequent ANDA submissions. These changes are to clarify that there are other
situations that may make an approval effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
66. Two comments would revise proposed &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv) regarding a certification that a patent is ``invalid
or will not be infringed.'' The comments would have this certification state that the patent is ``invalid and will
not be infringed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the suggested language. The provision simply paraphrases the statutory language for a paragraph
IV certification (see section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of the act). The agency has, however, amended the provision
to account for a certification that a patent is unenforceable and, as stated earlier, removed the language regarding
consent from the patent holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67. One comment asked FDA to amend proposed &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv)(B)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to require NDA holders to have a role in or consent to licensing agreements between patent owners and ANDA applicants.
The proposed rule would consider the effective date of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA to be the date
FDA issues an approval letter if, among other things, the drug product is covered by a patent licensing agreement and
the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA contains a statement that the applicant has been granted a patent license and a statement
from the patent owner that it has a licensing agreement with the applicant for the proposed drug product and that the
patent owner consents to an immediate effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated elsewhere in this final rule, FDA believes that the negotiations surrounding licensing agreements and
the parties entering into such agreements are outside the scope of this rule. Additionally, as stated in the response
to comment 43 above, the agency has deleted the provisions in &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv) relating to consent by a patent
owner to an immediate effective date of approval for a licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68. The agency, on its own initiative, has made minor grammatical changes and other revisions to &sect;314.107 (b)(2)
and (b)(3). These revisions replace ``Upon patent expiration'' with ``Patent Expiration'' and ``Upon disposition
of patent litigation'' with ``Disposition of patent litigation.'' Additionally, the changes specify that the patent
owner must receive the notice of certification and clarify, in &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i)(B), the effective date of
approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
69. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3) described the effective date of approval of a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA upon
disposition of patent litigation. Under proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i)(A), if an applicant certified that the
relevant patent was invalid or would not be infringed, and the patent owner or its representative brought suit for
patent infringement, the effective date of approval for the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA would be 30 months after
the date of receipt of the notice of certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement by the patent owner or its
representative unless a court extended or reduced the 30-month period. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i)(B) described
the effective date of approval of a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA upon disposition of patent litigation when the
patented drug product also qualified for 5 years of market exclusivity. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(ii) through
(b)(3)(iv) represented additional modifications to the effective date of approval due to court decisions or orders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment concerned the proposed language in &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i) regarding the 30-month period. The comment
would amend this provision to shorten or lengthen the 30-month period pursuant to a court order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The suggested change is unnecessary because &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) explains how the 30-month
period may be changed due to court decisions or orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also emphasizes that disposition of patent litigation will not result in automatic approval of a pending
application. FDA notes that section 505(c)(3)(C) and (j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act describe when approval of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
505(b)(2) application or an ANDA shall be made effective if an applicant submitting a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA
has made a paragraph IV certification and has or has not been sued for patent infringement. For example, if the applicant
made a paragraph IV certification, was sued for patent infringement, and the court hearing the patent infringement
suit decided that the patent was either invalid or not infringed, section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) and (j)(4)(B)(iii)(I)
of the act state, respectively, that approval of the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA may ``be made effective on the date
of the court decision.'' However, the agency interprets these provisions of the act as requiring, as a preliminary
matter, final agency approval of the application in order for any approval to be made effective. Thus, an applicant
with a tentative approval may not begin marketing its drug product until it has received an approval letter from the
agency because a tentative approval letter does not constitute a final ``approval'' of the application. In such cases,
the agency will examine the application to determine whether there have been any changes in the conditions under which
the application was tentatively approved. The tentative approval would become final and, therefore, effective
only when the agency sends an approval letter to the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, an applicant that has not yet received a tentative approval letter may not begin marketing its drug product
in the event that a court reaches a decision in any related patent infringement litigation because there is no final
``approval'' by FDA that could be made ``effective'' within section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) or (j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other provisions of the act support this interpretation of section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) and 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the
act as they relate to the expiration of the 30-month period or the date of the court decision. For example, section 505(j)(3)
of the act states that the agency shall approve an ANDA unless certain circumstances are found to exist. Section 505(j)(3)((A)
of the act prevents the agency from approving an ANDA if the agency finds that ``the methods used in, or the facilities
and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are inadequate to assure and preserve
its identity, strength, quality, and purity.'' Consequently, until FDA assesses the available information, often
from an additional current good manufacturing practices inspection, it cannot determine whether the applicant's
methods and controls used for the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are adequate to assure and preserve
the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity and therefore, under section 505(j)(3) of the act, whether the
ANDA should be approved. Thus, unless FDA has formally approved an ANDA under section 505(j)(3) of the act, there is
no ``approval'' that could be made effective under section 505(j)(4)(B) of the act upon resolution of the patent litigation.
(Section 505(d) of the act establishes an analogous approval requirement for 505(b)(2) applications.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history provides additional support for FDA's interpretation. In describing the provisions regarding
effective dates of approval and court decisions, the House Report states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee wishes to emphasize that the court 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
may not order an ANDA approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 under this provision. These are times when approval of an ANDA may be made effective 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
if the FDA has approved the ANDA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess., Part 1, 27&hyph;28 (1984) (emphasis added). The same concept is applicable
to 505(b)(2) applications (see id. at 34). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation of section 505(j)(4)(B) of the act reflects current FDA practice and revises the agency's previous
policy that was stated in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 54 FR 28872 at 28894). It also clarifies the agency's
position on delayed effective dates of approvals as expressed in the preamble to the final rule on ANDA content and
format that was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 28, 1992 (57 FR 17950 at 17956). Consequently, FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.107(b)(3)
to clarify when approval of an application may become effective and by adding a new paragraph (b)(3)(v) to state that,
in order for an approval to become effective under paragraph (b)(3), the applicant must first receive a final approval
letter from the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70. One comment would restrict proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(ii) to district court orders. The comment would revise
the rule to state: ``If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the district
court decides such patent is invalid or not infringed, the approval will be made effective on the date of the district
court order or judgment.'' The comment would also replace the words ``a final order'' in proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(iii)
and (b)(3)(iv) with ``an order or judgment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to limit the rule to district court orders. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA interprets
the requirement of a ``court decision'' to mean ``a final decision of a court from which no appeal can or has been taken''
(see 54 FR 28872 at 28895). Beginning the 180-day exclusivity period before the resolution of the appeals process
would render the exclusivity valueless to a prudent applicant who delayed marketing until the issues were resolved
on appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, however, revised &sect;314.107(b)(3)(iii) and (b)(3)(iv) to refer to an ``order or judgment'' because
both terms are sometimes used to refer to actions that terminate an action or decide a matter in litigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
71. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(4) concerned applicants who made multiple patent certifications. In essence, the
proposed provision would consider the approval of a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA to be effective on the last applicable
date. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.107(b)(4) by adding a new sentence stating: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If the applicant has submitted certifications under &sect;314.50(i) or &sect;314.94(a)(12) and has submitted
notice to the owner of the patent pursuant to &sect;314.95, and FDA subsequently receives a stipulation or order by
the district court notifying it that the applicant has amended its answer to add new arguments, not included in that
notice, in any ensuing suit for patent infringement, the date of approval will be calculated based on a 30-month period
starting at the date of receipt by FDA of each such stipulation or order, and the approval will become effective on the
last applicable date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, the comment suggested that an ANDA applicant who amended its answer to a patent infringement suit
to include arguments that were not in the notice to the patent owner under &sect;314.95 would be considered to have
been uncooperative in expediting the lawsuit. The comment explained that these revisions would prevent generic
drug companies from amending their answers during patent infringement litigation to delay completion of a trial
and also delay the start of the 30-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA declines to adopt the comment's suggestion. As stated above, FDA has revised the notice requirements in &sect;&sect;314.52(c)
and 314.95(c) to parallel the statutory language rather than specify notice requirements. The agency has neither
the resources nor the expertise to engage in patent disputes or questions regarding sufficiency of notice. The statute
leaves the issue of extending the 30-month period (based on a lack of cooperation between the parties in patent litigation)
to the discretion of the trial court. The agency believes that the trial court should make determinations of cooperation
on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the agency declines to amend the rule to consider an applicant to be uncooperative
and to extend the 30-month period if the applicant amends an answer to a complaint in patent litigation to include an
argument not reflected in the notice to the patent holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
72. FDA received several comments on proposed &sect;314.107(c) and the 180-day exclusivity period against subsequent
ANDA's. As proposed, &sect;314.107(c) would provide 180-day exclusivity to the first ANDA applicant that made a
paragraph IV patent certification (that the patent was invalid or not infringed) and was sued for patent infringement.
Seven comments said the language requiring an ANDA applicant to have been sued in order for the 180-day exclusivity
period to become effective was contrary to the statute and to a judicial ruling in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act can be applied straightforwardly only when an applicant who seeks the 180-day
period of exclusive marketing has been involved in a patent infringement lawsuit. To apply the section where there
has been no lawsuit would require that the agency ignore the textual relationship between section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii)
and (j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act and assume that Congress intended, contrary to the goals it stated in the legislative
history, to create an incentive for delay in generic competition, without any countervailing benefit to society.
Moreover, it would provide a windfall to an applicant who has not devoted the considerable time and money necessary
for patent litigation. Thus, consistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of the act, &sect;314.107(c)
applies only when the first applicant has been sued. Although, as the comments state, one Federal district court reached
a contrary conclusion, the agency appealed that decision and, on appeal, the decision was vacated as moot (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, however, revised &sect;314.107(c) to clarify other issues, such as the start and end of the 180-day exclusivity
period, and to make minor editorial changes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
73. One comment suggested revising proposed &sect;314.107(c) to state that the 180-day exclusivity period does
not apply to delay the effective date of approval of licensees to the NDA holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, FDA does not believe that an ANDA applicant who has made a paragraph IV certification and obtained
a patent license should be able to circumvent a 180-day exclusivity period. Consequently, the agency declines to
amend the provision as requested by the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74. Two comments would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c) to extend the 45-day period in which patent owners have to
file suit against an ANDA applicant. The proposal referred to the statutory 45-day period in which a patent owner would
have to file suit against an ANDA applicant. The comments would extend the 45-day period upon request or when the ANDA
applicant and the patent owner agree to an extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comments' suggestion. The 45-day period for filing a lawsuit against an ANDA applicant
is fully consistent with section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act, and the agency finds that there are sound policy reasons
that outweigh extensions of the 45-day period. For example, if an ANDA applicant has provided notice to a patent owner
stating that the ANDA applicant believes that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed (a paragraph IV certification),
the patent owner may elect to bring suit against the ANDA applicant for patent infringement. If the suit is brought
within 45 days from the date the ANDA applicant provided the notice, section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act precludes
the agency from granting a final approval of the ANDA. If suit is not brought within 45 days, FDA could grant a final approval
of the ANDA upon expiration of this time period, assuming that the ANDA met all applicable requirements for approval.
Thus, amending the rule to provide the patent owner an extension to file suit beyond the 45-day period would not prevent
the agency from approving ANDA's during the extension (because the statutory restriction against making an approval
effective would no longer apply), even if the patent owner later decided to bring suit against the ANDA applicant and
prevailed in that lawsuit. Such a result would waste agency and industry resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that, in situations where an ANDA applicant has amended its notification to the patent owner and approved
NDA holder to make it more complete, the agency may, under &sect;314.95(f), consider the 45-day period to begin on
the day after the date of receipt of the amended notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c) to begin the 180-day exclusivity period ``on the first day
that a court would allow non-infringing marketing (unless that decision were stayed)'' or ``30 months from receipt
of notice.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to revise the rule as suggested. The rule, which paraphrases the statutory language at section
505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act, better reflects the plain meaning of the act. Revising the rule as requested by the comment
would begin the 180-day exclusivity period at the end of the 30-month period without regard to whether the applicant
had commenced marketing on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
76. Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) would provide 180-day exclusivity to the first ANDA applicant to submit a complete
ANDA with a paragraph IV patent certification and ``to be sued within 45 days of the patent owner's receipt of notice.''
One comment said the rule, as drafted, created an incentive for frivolous claims of patent invalidity or noninfringement
because it would give ANDA applicants exclusivity even if the applicant was unsuccessful in defending against the
patent owner's lawsuit. The comment would replace the phrase ``to be sued within 45 days'' with ``and to successfully
defend a suit brought within 45 days.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has amended &sect;314.107(c) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
77. FDA received several comments regarding proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii). These provisions
concerned the start of the 180-day exclusivity period. Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) would begin the 180-day
exclusivity period on the date of the first commercial marketing of the drug product by the first ANDA applicant who
submitted a substantially complete ANDA containing a certification that the patent was invalid or not infringed
and who was sued for patent infringement within 45 days after providing notice to the patent owner. Alternatively,
proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) would begin the 180-day exclusivity period on the ``date a decision of the court
holding the relevant patent invalid or not infringed'' if that date was earlier than the date of the first commercial
marketing. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) to include a cross-reference to the language
in &sect;314.107(b)(3) on patent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the suggested revision. The agency believes that the meaning of &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) is
sufficiently clear so that the court referred to in &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) is the court deciding the patent infringement
suit. However, for reasons stated elsewhere in this document, the agency has amended this provision to include a reference
to unenforceable patents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
78. One comment would amend &sect;314.107(c), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(1)(ii) to permit an ANDA applicant to decide whether
to start the 180-day exclusivity period on the date it notifies the agency that the applicant has begun commercial
marketing of the drug product or to wait to see whether the court decision is appealed. If an appeal did result, the comment
would permit the ANDA applicant to have the 180-day period begin when a court issues a decision on the appeal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA declines to amend the provision as suggested by the comment. The provision is consistent with section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv)
of the act by beginning the 180-day period on the date the first ANDA applicant has notified the agency that it has begun
commercial marketing of the drug product or the date of a court decision holding the patent to be invalid or not infringed,
``whichever is earlier'' (see section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act).) Allowing an applicant to begin marketing before
the commencement of the 180-day exclusivity period would, in effect, extend the exclusivity period in a manner that
is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the act. FDA also notes that the court decision must be a final decision from
which no appeal can be or has been taken (see 54 FR 28872 at 28895). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79. FDA received four comments regarding ``substantially complete'' applications under proposed &sect;314.107(c)(2).
Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(2) would consider an ANDA to have been ``previously submitted'' with respect to another
application for the same listed drug ``if the date on which the first application was both substantially complete
and contained a certification that the patent was invalid or not infringed is earlier than the date on which the second
application was both substantially complete and contained the same certification.'' The proposal also stated that
a ``substantially complete'' application ``must contain the results of any required bioequivalence studies, or,
if applicable, a request for a waiver of such studies.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked FDA to provide information as to which ANDA was the first ``substantially complete'' ANDA. The comment
suggested that disclosing such information did not present any confidentiality problems because the ANDA applicant
would have revealed the existence of the ANDA when it provided notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of the patent to the patent owner and NDA holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees, in part, with the comment. Disclosing whether an ANDA had been received for a specific listed drug would
enable manufacturers to decide whether to develop a generic version of that drug and perhaps conserve the manufacturer's
resources. Such knowledge could, in turn, effectively reduce the number of applications for the same product and
thus also conserve agency resources. The agency, therefore, will disclose whether an ANDA has been received for a
particular drug, but, in order to preserve the confidentiality of the applicant, will not disclose when the application
had been received or the applicant's identity. Potential applicants who wish to inquire whether an ANDA for a specific
drug has been received can contact the Regulatory Support Branch (HFD&hyph;615), Food and Drug Administration,
7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0315. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80. Two comments disagreed with the language regarding ``substantially complete'' applications. One comment said
FDA should only determine whether an ANDA contains a bioequivalence test or waiver request and not focus on the results
of any required bioequivalence studies. The second comment suggested that a ``substantially complete'' ANDA be
one that contained a paragraph IV patent certification and a bioequivalence study that is ultimately approved. The
comment said this change would deter ANDA applicants from submitting ``superficial'' bioequivalence tests. The
comment also suggested that the agency establish criteria as to whether changes to an ANDA were so substantial that
the ANDA could no longer be considered as the first to be filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the proposed rule, FDA has clarified its policies regarding the submission of incomplete ANDA's.
Under the earlier policy, ANDA applicants could submit ANDA's with bioequivalence study protocols and could provide
bioequivalence study data at a later date. This policy resulted in a significant and unwarranted expenditure of resources
in reviewing applications that had little potential for approval. Thus, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 28, 1992, FDA announced that it would no longer accept an ANDA that does not contain complete bioequivalence
study data if such data are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for approval (see 57 FR 17950 at 17959). A ``substantially complete'' application, therefore, should have
a complete bioequivalence study, or other information to show bioequivalence that could support approval of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. FDA will examine the bioequivalence information upon submission and, if the agency determines that
the bioequivalence information is facially insufficient to support a finding of bioequivalence, the agency will
not review the application under &sect;314.101(d). A decision by the agency after receipt of an application that
the bioequivalence information is inadequate for approval does not necessarily mean that the application was not
substantially complete at the time of submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to establish criteria to establish whether changes to an ANDA were so substantial that it could not
be considered to have been filed. While certain changes in an ANDA (e.g., a change in the listed drug) would amount to
a new filing for purposes of &sect;314.107(c)(2), other changes (e.g., minor labeling changes) would not. The agency
believes a case-by-case approach is preferable because many products and manufacturers may be unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
81. The agency, on its own initiative, has revised the provisions in &sect;314.107 (c)(2) and (c)(3) to clarify their
intent. These provisions address the issues of the ``applicant submitting the first application'' for exclusivity
purposes, what constitutes a ``substantially complete'' application, and the effective dates of approval for subsequently
submitted applications if the first applicant is not ``actively pursuing'' approval. FDA has made similar editorial
changes at &sect;314.107(c)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
82. Four comments addressed proposed &sect;314.107(c)(3). The proposed provision would make an ANDA that had been
received after FDA had already received an ANDA for the same drug immediately effective if the agency concluded that
the first ANDA applicant ``is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application.'' Three comments asked
FDA to define the phrase ``actively pursuing approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this rule, the phrase ``actively pursuing approval'' is intended to encompass a drug sponsor's good
faith effort to pursue marketing approval in a timely manner. In determining whether a sponsor is actively pursuing
marketing approval, FDA will consider all relevant factors, such as the sponsor's compliance with regulations and
the timeliness of its responses to FDA's questions or application deficiencies during the review period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
83. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c)(3) to make a subsequently received ANDA immediately effective
upon a finding that the first applicant is not actively pursuing approval ``if [the subsequent application is] otherwise
eligible for an immediately effective approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees and has amended the provision accordingly. This change will remind applicants that FDA will make
approval of a subsequent abbreviated application immediately effective if it satisfies all applicable requirements

84. FDA received five comments regarding the interpretation of ``the court'' and court judgments in proposed &sect;314.107(e)(1).
Proposed &sect;314.107(e)(1) stated that ``the court'' in &sect;314.107(b) and (c) referred to ``the court that
enters final judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken.'' Three comments supported the proposal, but two
comments argued that FDA had misconstrued the 1984 amendments. One comment argued that the court finding a patent
to be invalid or not infringed should be ``the court of first instance'' or district court because a decision that a
patent was invalid or not infringed or a decision to issue an injunction would be done by a district court. Another comment
argued that interpreting ``the court'' to mean the court that enters final judgment ``effectively gives a patent
owner an additional extension of the patent *&blank;*&blank;* for the duration of the appeal'' and delay generic
competition. The comment would revise the rule to permit an ANDA applicant to market its drug product after it had prevailed
at the trial court level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to amend &sect;314.107(e)(1) as suggested by the comments. To construe ``the court'' as a district court,
regardless of any appeal of the district court decision, would deny the benefits of exclusivity to a prudent applicant
that delayed marketing its product until resolution of an appeal by the patent holder (see 54 FR 28872 at 28894). Moreover,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the patent holder appealed the district court decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and were able to obtain a stay or an injunction against the marketing of the applicant's product, the applicant could
lose the entire 180-day exclusivity period before the stay or injunction were lifted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these considerations, FDA believes that any reference to ``the court'' must be the court that enters final judgment
from which no appeal can be or has been taken. (The reference to ``appeals'' does not include the certiorari process.
The likelihood of an appellate court decision being heard and overruled by the Supreme Court is too remote to warrant
delaying marketing and exclusivity pending resolution of a petition for writ of certiorari.) This interpretation
avoids potentially premature decisions on the effective date of ANDA approval and the loss of 180-day exclusivity.
FDA has, however, also revised &sect;314.107(e)(2) to clarify which court decisions will represent the ``final''
judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(e)(2) to refer to a court order or judgment rather than simply
a court judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As amended, &sect;314.107(e)(2) refers to a court ``decision,'' which could be in the form of either an order or a judgment.
The agency has also made minor changes to &sect;314.107(e)(2) to clarify that the court decisions involve patent
issues and that a higher court can hold or affirm a lower court decision that a patent is invalid, unenforceable, or
not infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86. A second comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(e)(2) to require applicants to submit copies of a court
order or judgment to the Division of Generic Drugs or ``New Drug Evaluation Division (where applicable).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees with the comment, and has added &sect;314.107(e)(2)(iv) to require applicants to send a copy of a final
decision to the Office of Generic Drugs, or to the appropriate division in the Office of Drug Evaluation I or the Office
of Drug Evaluation II, whichever is applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
87. Proposed &sect;314.107(f) described how the 45-day period for filing a patent infringement suit would be determined.
In brief, under proposed &sect;314.107(f)(1), the 45-day period would begin on the day after the date the patent owner
or approved application holder, if an exclusive patent licensee, received a notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of the patent. Proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2) would require the 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant
to notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement had been filed. Several comments objected to language in proposed
&sect;314.107(f) that would consider notice to or actions by exclusive licensees to be equivalent to notice to or
actions by a patent owner. The comments said that exclusive licensees do not always share the patent owner's interests.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has revised the rule to remove language that would consider exclusive licensees to be equivalent to
patent owners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
88. One comment objected to proposed &sect;314.107(f)(1) because it would start the 45-day period on the day after
the date the patent owner or the approved application holder, if an exclusive patent licensee, received notice of
invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. The comment argued that the 45-day period should begin on the day after
the date that the patent owner and the approved application holder received notice and, if these dates differed, the
latest date should mark the start of the 45-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with the comment and has revised &sect;314.107(f)(1) to begin the 45-day period on the day after
the date the patent owner and the approved application holder have received the applicant's notice of certification
of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
89. FDA received several comments on proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2). Absent a notice of an action for patent infringement,
the proposal would make the approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective immediately upon the expiration
of the 45-day period for filing a patent infringement suit or upon FDA's completion of the review and approval process,
whichever is later. The comments noted that the regulation would have ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicants notify FDA whether
a patent infringement suit had been filed and asked FDA to permit, by regulation, patent owners to notify FDA whether
it had brought suit. Alternatively, some comments would require the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certify that it had
not been sued. The comments explained that these changes were necessary because ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants would
have no interest in notifying FDA whether suit had been filed because, without such notice, they could immediately
secure effective approval of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has amended &sect;314.107(f)(2) to permit patent owners or their representatives to notify FDA whether
a patent infringement suit has been filed. The statute does not require applicants to certify that they have not been
sued, and the agency does not believe such a burden to be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has also made minor revisions to &sect;314.107(f)(2) to place more emphasis on an applicant's obligation
to notify FDA immediately of the filing of any legal action within 45 days of receipt of a notice of certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the agency has made a grammatical change in &sect;314.107(f)(2) to clarify that applicants must send
the notification to the Office of Generic Drugs or to the appropriate division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research reviewing the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
90. One comment addressed the requirement in proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2) that a 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant
notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement had been filed ``before the expiration of the 45-day time period
or the completion of the agency's review of the application, whichever occurs later.'' The comment argued that a patent
owner had 45 days to file a lawsuit after receiving a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a
patent and, therefore, a party should have an additional time period beyond the 45-day period for filing an action
for patent infringement for notifying the agency whether an action had been filed. The comment would revise the rule
to give a party an additional 15 days beyond the 45-day period to notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement
had been filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to revise the rule as suggested. FDA believes it is important to learn immediately if an action
for patent infringement is filed before the completion of the 45-day period to avoid an erroneous approval with an
immediate effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, therefore, amended &sect;314.107(f)(2) to require applicants to notify FDA immediately whether any legal
action has been filed. The agency has also amended this subsection to clarify the identity of the ``applicant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
91. FDA has, on its own initiative, clarified its notification requirements in &sect;314.107(f)(2)(iii). As proposed,
&sect;314.107(f)(2)(iii) would have required parties to identify a drug by its established name, but would not have
expressly required any identification of the drug if no established name existed. The agency has amended this provision
to require identification of the drug product by its established name or, if no established name exists, its active
ingredient(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92. One comment asked FDA to publish information regarding the status and progress of patent infringement suits so
other ANDA applicants could decide whether to intervene in the suit ``and ask that the 30-month period be shortened
or lengthened in the event that it feels that one or both of the litigants are not reasonably cooperating in expediting
the action.'' Alternatively, the comment asked FDA to permit any interested party to petition the agency ``to remove
an ANDA from exclusivity considerations if it has not proceeded with due diligence_either in prosecution of its ANDA
or defense of an infringement suit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that ANDA applicants are capable of monitoring the progress of patent litigation without imposing the
additional burden of acquiring and publishing information on patent litigation on FDA. The agency, therefore, declines
to adopt the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to amend the rule to permit third parties to petition the agency to deny exclusivity to an ANDA due
to the ANDA applicant's actions during litigation. Under the statute, the reduction or enlargement of the 30-month
period is left to the trial court's discretion. Intervention by the agency is unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93. One comment suggested replacing the words, ``action to defend,'' in proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2)(iv) with
the words, ``action for patent infringement.'' The comment said that ``action to defend'' was not a term of art. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has adopted the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94. FDA, on its own initiative, has modified the language regarding waivers in &sect;314.107(f)(3). The change is
intended to clarify that the patent owner does not object to FDA's approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application with
an immediate effective date and to account for those situations where the ANDA applicant or 505(b)(2) applicant and
the patent owner have agreed to extend the 45-day period.

J. Section 314.108_New Drug Product Exclusivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.108 was intended to implement the new drug exclusivity provisions under section 505(c)(3)(D)
and (j)(4)(D) of the act. This section of the act provides specific time periods, known as new drug product exclusivity
or market exclusivity, during which the effective date of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA must be delayed
or, in some cases, a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA cannot be submitted. For example, section 505(c)(3)(D)(i) and
(j)(4)(D)(i) of the act grant a 10-year period of exclusivity to new chemical entities that were approved during January
1, 1982, to September 24, 1984. Section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii) of the act grant a 5-year period of exclusivity
to new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984. These sections of the act expressly state that no 505(b)(2)
application or ANDA may be submitted during the exclusivity period except that such applications may be submitted
after 4 years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. Section 505(c)(3)(D)(iii),
(c)(3)(D)(iv), (j)(4)(D)(iii), and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act grant a 3-year period of exclusivity to an application
or supplemental application that is approved after September 24, 1984, and contains ``reports of new clinical investigations
(other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval'' of the application or supplemental application
and ``conducted or sponsored by'' the person submitting the application or supplemental application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(c)(3)(D)(v) and (j)(4)(D)(v) of the act granted a 2-year period of exclusivity to drugs that are not chemical
entities or for certain changes to already approved products that were approved during January 1, 1982, to September
24, 1984. FDA did not propose any regulations for this 2-year period because it expired on September 24, 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusivity provisions of the act do not provide any protection from the marketing of a generic version of the same
drug product if the generic version is the subject of a full NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4) would provide 3 years of exclusivity to an application that was submitted under
section 505(b) of the act, was approved after September 24, 1984, was for a drug product containing an active moiety
that had been previously approved in another application under section 505(b) of the act, and contained reports of
new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that
were essential to approval of the application. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(5) would provide 3 years of exclusivity
to a supplemental application that was approved after September 24, 1984, and contained reports of new clinical investigations
(other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of
the application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments addressed the scope of new drug exclusivity. Two comments said FDA should grant exclusivity for
any change to an approved drug product or, alternatively, should grant exclusivity based on specific types of studies,
such as studies intended to reduce drug dosing or drug efficacy study implementation (DESI) upgrade studies. One
comment disagreed with the preamble to the proposed rule, which stated, ``FDA expects that only those changes in an
approved drug product that affect its active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, route of administration or conditions
of use would be granted exclusivity'' (54 FR 28872 at 28899). Two comments asked FDA to clarify whether a clinical investigation
establishing new risks could be eligible for exclusivity. The preamble to the proposed rule had indicated that such
studies would not qualify for exclusivity because ``protection of the public health demands that all products' labeling
contain all relevant warnings'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28899). One comment said FDA should accept an applicant's claim
of exclusivity alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other comments sought to limit exclusivity or clarify its scope. One comment argued that the rule was too broad,
would confer ``an unearned windfall,'' and stifle generic competition. The comment explained that some variations,
such as reductions in dosage, require little effort but would nevertheless qualify for exclusivity. The comment
suggested that the rule define what types of changes would qualify for exclusivity. The second comment agreed with
the preamble that DESI upgrades should not qualify for exclusivity but asked FDA to create a procedure whereby parties
could contact FDA to determine whether exclusivity information was accurate. The comment said this would enable
third parties to decide whether to challenge decisions to grant or deny exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with those comments that would grant exclusivity for any change to an approved drug product or accept,
without question, an applicant's claim that it is entitled to exclusivity. Under the statute and this final rule,
certain drugs or changes to drugs can receive 3 years of exclusivity if the application or supplement to an application
``contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval
*&blank;*&blank;*'' (see section 505(j)(4)(D)(iii) and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act). The phrase ``essential to the
approval'' suggests that the clinical investigations that warrant exclusivity must be vital to the application
or supplement. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``to qualify for exclusivity, there must not be published
reports of studies other than those conducted or sponsored by the applicant, or other information available to the
agency sufficient for FDA to conclude that a proposed drug product or change to an already approved drug product is
safe and effective'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28900). For example, the agency would not consider studies to support a switch
from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status to be ``essential to approval'' if the agency already had sufficient
information to conclude that the OTC product would be safe and effective. (In OTC switch situations, FDA encourages
applicants to consult FDA to determine whether clinical investigations or any other actions are necessary to permit
FDA to approve a switch in a product's status.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to define in the regulation the kinds of supplemental applications that, if supported by clinical investigations,
would warrant 3-year exclusivity. Although the preamble to the proposed rule identified certain types of changes
in a product that would normally warrant exclusivity (changes in active ingredient, strength, dosage form, route
of administration, or conditions of use), the agency did not intend to suggest that other types of changes would not
qualify. For example, changes in dosing regimen have resulted in grants of 3-year exclusivity. Changes that would
not warrant exclusivity are, as discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, changes in labeling that involve warnings
or other similar risk information that must be included in the labeling of generic competitors. Applicants obtaining
approval for such changes in labeling would, in any event, have no valid interest in precluding such information from
the labeling of other products. Furthermore, FDA does not consider a study to be ``essential to approval'' simply
because the applicant conducted it and submitted the study for agency review (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's interpretation is supported by statements that were made during the congressional debates surrounding the
3-year exclusivity provisions. Senator Orrin Hatch described the 3-year exclusivity provisions upon approval
of certain supplemental applications as protecting ``some changes in strength, indications, and so forth, which
require considerable time and expense in FDA required clinical testing'' (130 Congressional Record S10505, August
10, 1984) (statement of Senator Hatch)). Representative Henry Waxman said 3-year exclusivity was intended to ``encourage
drugmakers to obtain FDA approval for significant therapeutic uses of previously approved drugs'' (130 Congressional
Record H9114, (September 6, 1984)). Thus, an applicant is not entitled to 3-year exclusivity merely because it supplements
an approved application based in part on a clinical investigation or because it certifies to FDA that the clinical
investigation is essential to approval of the application or supplement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to create a new procedure whereby a party could contact FDA to determine whether exclusivity information
is accurate. Interested parties can obtain information on exclusivity decisions through the Freedom of Information
Act process (21 CFR part 20). Parties who wish to challenge an exclusivity decision can utilize the citizen petition
procedures (21 CFR 10.30).

96. One comment suggested that products whose labeling may not include certain therapeutic indications (due to exclusivity
or patent protection) be listed in the Orange Book as not being therapeutically equivalent to the innovator product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FDA addressed this comment in its response to a citizen petition submitted by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
(PMA). The response stated, in pertinent part:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In drafting the 1984 Amendments, the only mechanism that Congress provided for enforcing the exclusivity accorded
a new indication is the requirement that ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications be given delayed effective approval for
the exclusive indication. During the period that ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications may not be made effective, pioneers
thus have the exclusive right to promote and label their products for the exclusive indication. Nothing in the language
of the amended statute or its legislative history, however, suggests that Congress intended the granting of exclusivity
for a new indication to alter therapeutic equivalence ratings. Moreover, it would be inconsistent with the established
standards for making therapeutic equivalence determinations to rate two products as not therapeutically equivalent
simply because one is labeled with fewer than all the approved indications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's standards for therapeutic equivalence determinations * * * have always been based upon scientific considerations
relevant to predicting the comparative pharmacological behavior of two products in or on the human body. There is
no scientific basis for concluding that differences in recommended indications are relevant to this prediction.
For example, the fact that a particular brand of drug is recommended in a medical journal article for an unlabeled use,
does not, from a scientific standpoint, render other brands of the same drug therapeutically or biologically inequivalent.
Similarly, the fact that a pioneer drug is labeled with a protected indication does not mean that generic copies of
the same drug are not therapeutically equivalent to the pioneer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In absence of any suggestion in the statute or legislative history that Congress intended FDA to alter the scientific
basis of therapeutic equivalence ratings to enforce exclusivity, FDA declines to consider non-scientific criteria,
i.e., the existence of exclusive indications, in making therapeutic equivalence decisions.

 (providing 10 years of exclusivity under section 505(j)(4)(D)(i) of the act for products offering the same therapeutic
moiety in different active ingredient forms if the salt or ester form was approved subsequent to the pure therapeutic
moiety form) was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Noting that such an interpretation
would award exclusivity to both an active moiety and a salt if the application containing the active moiety were submitted
first, but would award exclusivity only to the salt if the salt were submitted first, the court of appeals rejected
the interpretation as ``farfetched because it is not consistent with any legislative goal'' (see

 920 F.2d 984, 989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the court of appeals appeared to agree with the agency's conclusion that exclusivity should be limited to
the first approved product containing the active moiety, the court found the agency's parsing of the operative statutory
phrase ``active ingredient (including any salt or ester of the active ingredient)'' to be linguistically impermissible
as set forth in the agency's administrative decision denying 10-year exclusivity to Abbott. Rather than interpret
the term ``active ingredient'' broadly to include the concept of active moiety, the agency interpreted the term narrowly
to refer to the form of the moiety in the product, but interpreted the parenthetical phrase ``(including any salt or
ester of the active ingredient)'' broadly to include all active ingredients that are different but contain the same
active moiety. Although the court noted that the agency had, subsequent to the administrative decision, voiced the
more linguistically permissible construction (interpreting the term ``active ingredient'' to refer to active
moiety), the court found that it could not consider this construction because it was not relied upon in the administrative
decision. The court thus remanded the case to the district court with instructions to remand the issue to the agency
for further consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The agency has concluded that the term ``active ingredient,'' as used in the phrase ``active ingredient (including
any salt or ester of the active ingredient),'' means active moiety. Thus, the agency declines to adopt the comments
suggesting removal of the definition of, and references to, ``active moiety'' from &sect;314.108.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA disagrees with the assertion that the definition of ``active moiety'' should not exclude chelates, clathrates,
and other noncovalent derivatives. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, exclusivity is intended to provide
incentives for innovation (see 54 FR 28872 at 28898 and 28899). The addition of a chelate, clathrate, or other noncovalent
derivative generally does not affect the active moiety of a drug product. The agency, therefore, does not believe
that providing exclusivity for chelates, clathrates, and other noncovalent derivatives of a previously approved
active moiety would be consistent with the statutory intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
98. FDA received a number of comments regarding the term ``substantial support'' in the definition of ``conducted
or sponsored by the applicant'' in proposed &sect;314.108(a). The proposed rule stated, ``Ordinarily, substantial
support will mean providing 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28930). The comments
said the 50 percent figure was unrealistic, unnecessary, or unauthorized by law and argued that cost should not be
a controlling factor in determining new drug exclusivity. Other comments said the rule should permit firms to buy
studies because there is no basis to grant exclusivity to a firm that purchases an NDA and to deny exclusivity to a firm
that purchases a study. One comment asked how FDA would treat a publicly funded study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 50-percent contribution requirement reflects a reasonable interpretation of section 505 (j)(4)(D)(iii) and
(j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act. A study can be conducted by or for only one applicant. Exclusivity based on less than 50-percent
funding would allow multiple parties to claim exclusivity against ANDA applicants as well as each other. Moreover,
the legislative history indicates that Congress created 3-year exclusivity to protect products whose development
required a significant time commitment and ``an investment of some magnitude'' (see 130 Congressional Record S10504
(August 10, 1984) (statement of Senator Hatch); 130 Congressional Record H9124&hyph;H9125 (September 6, 1984)
(statement of Representative Waxman)). Obviously, if a sponsor provided 50 percent or more funding to a study, its
investment represents a substantial portion of the study's funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA acknowledges that there may be some rare circumstance in which less than 50-percent funding could constitute
``substantial support'' and merit exclusivity. FDA has, therefore, revised the rule to require: (1) A certified
statement from a Certified Public Accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting
the study; or (2) an explanation from the applicant why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored
the study if the applicant's financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent if the applicant did not sponsor
the investigational new drug application. The agency has made a corresponding change to &sect;314.50(j)(4)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to studies that the applicant has purchased and publicly funded studies, FDA agrees that an applicant
who has purchased exclusive rights to a study should be able to obtain new drug exclusivity. FDA, therefore, has revised
the definition of ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant'' to state that the purchase of nonexclusive rights to
an investigation does not satisfy the definition. FDA emphasizes that the applicant must have exclusive rights to
the purchased study in order to be deemed to have sponsored a study. The purchase of nonexclusive rights by different
parties could result in multiple claims of exclusivity for the same study. For these reasons, FDA also believes that
most, if not all, publicly funded studies will not qualify for exclusivity. These studies are usually publicly available,
so FDA will not give one applicant exclusive rights based on a study that, by virtue of its funding, belongs to the general
public and is publicly available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99. The agency, on its own initiative, has amended the definition of ``date of approval'' to note that the date of approval
``refers only to a final approval and not to a tentative approval that may become effective at a later date.'' This change
reflects FDA's position that drug products with delayed effective dates of approval are not listed drugs and that
an ``approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and does not become final until the effective date'' (see
57 FR 17950 at 17953). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100. One comment said proposed &sect;314.108(a) failed to correspond to proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i), which
states that &sect;314.108(a) defines ``new'' and ``clinical investigations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) contained an error. The proposed rule does not contain separate definitions for
``new'' and ``clinical investigations''; it does, however, define ``new clinical investigations'' at &sect;314.108(a).
FDA has corrected &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
101. One comment objected to the last sentence in the definition of ``new clinical investigation.'' The comment claimed
that the definition would ``unnecessarily, and contrary to the Statute, ``expand and award an exclusivity for a previously
submitted study; and it unjustifiably distinguishes between safety and effectiveness.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the statute, 3-year exclusivity is awarded if the application or supplemental application contained reports
of new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to the approval
of the application or supplemental application (see section 505(j)(4)(D)(iii) and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act). The
legislative history indicates that 3-year exclusivity is for investigations requiring a considerable investment
of time and money and that are necessary for approval of important innovations (see 54 FR 28872 at 28899). Thus, FDA
interprets ``new clinical investigation'' as a clinical investigation whose data have not been relied upon by FDA
to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved drug for any indication or safety
in a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation relied upon by FDA to demonstrate
a previously approved drug's effectiveness or safety in a new patient population. An applicant is not limited to recently
conducted clinical investigations; a clinical investigation that provides a ``new'' basis for drug approval can
qualify for exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
102. Two comments recommended revising the rule to address transfers of new drug exclusivity between an applicant
and all predecessors in interest, including licensors, assignors, joint venture partners, or other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New drug exclusivity is not a property right, but is rather a statutory obligation on the agency. This statutory obligation
is based on data and information in an approved application. Although an applicant may purchase an application or
rights to data and information in an application (i.e., exclusive rights to a new clinical investigation), from which
exclusivity would flow, there is no property right to exclusivity itself that can be transferred separately and apart
from the application or data upon which exclusivity is based. The agency does, however, permit the submission or approval
of an ANDA when the holder of the exclusivity permits FDA to receive or approve the ANDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that joint venture partners differ from licensees, assignors, etc., because joint venture partners share
in developing a drug product. Consequently, FDA suggests that joint venture partners carefully consider how they
will seek approval of an application and define their rights and interests in the application to avoid questions regarding
applicability of the exclusivity provisions of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, FDA has revised the definition of the phrase, ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant,'' to construe
a party who has purchased exclusive rights to a study to have ``conducted or sponsored'' the study. This change will
enable a party who has acquired exclusive rights to a study to seek exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103. Four comments asked FDA to create a mechanism that would determine whether a study was ``essential for approval''
either before an application would be submitted or before the study began. Proposed &sect;314.108(a) stated that
``essential to approval'' with regard to an investigation ``means that the application could not be approved by FDA
without that investigation, even with a delayed effective date.'' The proposal, however, did not discuss the procedure
by which FDA would determine a study to be ``essential to approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comments. FDA cannot determine whether a study is essential for approval until the application
is approved. Research goals and objectives often change during clinical investigations. For example, the results
from a study designed to support a new indication could generate interest in a completely different indication. The
product ultimately approved may be a different product from that characterized in the original application. It is
also possible that newly available data in the public domain will obviate the need for the study prior to approval.
Thus, FDA will decide whether a study is essential for approval at the time of approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has, however, amended the definition of ``essential to approval'' to delete the reference to a delayed
effective date. This change is necessary because the agency no longer regards an application with a delayed effective
date as being approved. Instead, FDA considers such applications as being tentatively approved (see 57 FR 17950 at
17953). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
104. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(2) would provide 5 years of exclusivity for a new chemical entity if a drug product
containing the new chemical entity was approved after September 24, 1984, in an application submitted under section
505(b) of the act. One comment said FDA should deny 5-year exclusivity to any section ``505(b)(2) application for
a new chemical entity that relies upon one or more investigations that are essential for approval of the application
but which were not conducted or sponsored by the applicant * * *.'' The comment explained that a 505(b)(2) applicant
could assemble literature demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a drug product marketed before 1962 (when
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was amended to require new drugs to be safe and effective for their intended
uses) or 1938 (when the Food and Drugs Act was amended to require new drugs to be safe for the conditions of their intended
use) and, under the rule, seek 5 years of new drug exclusivity. The comment said granting exclusivity to such drugs
would be inconsistent with statutory intent and the legislative history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute, a drug product may qualify for 5 years of exclusivity if its active moiety has not been previously
approved in any other application (see section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii) of the act). For some drug products
marketed before 1938 or 1962, the active moiety will have been the subject of an approved application (under prior
versions of the act or as part of a combination product approved under the act), so the active moiety will be ineligible
for 5-year exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that the statute provides 5-year exclusivity for applications approved under section 505(b) of the
act and that such applications are submitted by persons who wish to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate
commerce ``any new drug.'' (See section 505(a) and (c)(3)(D)(ii).) The term ``new drug'' is defined in section 201(p)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)). Drug products with active ingredients marketed before 1938 or 1962 may be ``new drugs,''
especially where there has been a change in the product's labeling, composition, or manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products falling within the definition of a ``new drug'' must be approved under section 505(b) of the act and, as a result,
may qualify for 5-year exclusivity under the language of the act and consistent with legislative history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
105. One comment said that FDA should provide 5 years of exclusivity for a single enantiomer of a previously approved
racemate. The comment asserted that FDA approval of a racemic drug mixture covers the mixture rather than the enantiomers
that compose the mixture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to revise the rule as requested by the comment. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the
agency's position is that ``a single enantiomer of a previously approved racemate contains a previously approved
active moiety and is therefore not considered a new chemical entity'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28898).

106. One comment asked FDA to interpret the phrase ``conditions of approval'' in proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4)(iv)
narrowly to limit exclusivity to studies conducted by the original applicant. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4) stated
that if an application: (i) Was submitted under section 505(b) of the act; (ii) was approved after September 24, 1984;
(iii) was for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved in another application
under section 505(b) of the act; and (iv) contained reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability
studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application, the agency will
not make effective for a period of 3 years after the date of approval of the application the approval of a 505(b)(2) application,
or an ANDA for the conditions of approval of the original application, or an ANDA submitted pursuant to an approved
petition under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act that relies on the information supporting the conditions of approval
of an original NDA. The comment said subsequent applicants who conduct their own studies to obtain approval should
not be subject to the original applicant's exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment misinterprets the scope of exclusivity. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule
and the preamble to this final rule, market exclusivity does not provide any protection from the marketing of a generic
version of the same drug product if the generic version is the subject of a full NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1)
of the act (see 54 FR 28872 at 28896). As discussed earlier, the statute does not require that the original applicant
``conduct'' the study to obtain exclusivity. FDA interprets the act to allow for exclusivity where the applicant
has supported the study by providing more than 50 percent of the funding or by purchasing exclusive rights to the study.

IV. Analysis of Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of this rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and,
when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential
economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The
agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the
Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order
and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact on small entities. Title I of Pub. L. 98&hyph;417 eliminated unnecessary regulatory barriers for generic
drug products and has resulted in generic competition on many important post-1962 drugs. Generic drug sales account
for a significant portion of total prescription drug sales, and many of these sales would not have occurred in the absence
of Pub. L. 98&hyph;417. This competition has saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars per year, and FDA concludes
that this impact is directly attributable to the statute. This rule will not affect the pace or magnitude of this economic
impact. The rule simply clarifies and facilitates implementation of the act. Thus, FDA certifies that this rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

to FDA in the form of applications, notices, and certifications. FDA will use this information to determine whether
patent information for a drug product has been submitted and whether an applicant is seeking market exclusivity for
a particular drug product.

4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section (``Paragraph IV Certification'') as to that patent and a statement that it has been granted a patent

After removal of a patent from the list. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a patent is removed from the list, any applicant with a pending application (including a tentatively approved application
with a delayed effective date) who has made a certification with respect to such patent shall amend its certification.
The applicant shall certify under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section that no patents described in paragraph (i)(1)(i)
of this section claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, shall amend the certification to refer
only to those relevant patents. In the amendment, the applicant shall state the reason for the change in certification
(that the patent is or has been removed from the list). A patent that is the subject of a lawsuit under &sect;314.107(c)
shall not be removed from the list until FDA determines either that no delay in effective dates of approval is required
under that section as a result of the lawsuit, that the patent has expired, or that any such period of delay in effective
dates of approval is ended. An applicant shall submit an amended certification as an amendment to a pending application.
Once an amendment for the change has been submitted, the application will no longer be considered to be one containing
a certification under paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Other amendments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(4) and (i)(6)(iii)(B) of this section, an applicant shall amend a submitted
certification if, at any time before the effective date of the approval of the application, the applicant learns that
the submitted certification is no longer accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) An applicant is not required to amend a submitted certification when information on an otherwise applicable patent
is submitted after the effective date of approval for the 505(b)(2) application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A statement that the applicant is claiming exclusivity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) If the applicant claims exclusivity under &sect;314.108(b)(2), information to show that, to the best of its knowledge
or belief, a drug has not previously been approved under section 505(b) of the act containing any active moiety in the
drug for which the applicant is seeking approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the applicant claims exclusivity under &sect;314.108(b)(4) or (b)(5), the following information to show
that the application contains ``new clinical investigations'' that are ``essential to approval of the application
or supplement'' and were ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant:'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``New clinical investigations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' A certification that to the best of the applicant's knowledge each of the clinical investigations included in the
application meets the definition of ``new clinical investigation'' set forth in &sect;314.108(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Essential to approval.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A list of all published studies or publicly available reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant through
a literature search that are relevant to the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval, a certification
that the applicant has thoroughly searched the scientific literature and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge,
the list is complete and accurate and, in the applicant's opinion, such published studies or publicly available reports
do not provide a sufficient basis for the approval of the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval without
reference to the new clinical investigation(s) in the application, and an explanation as to why the studies or reports
are insufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Conducted or sponsored by.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the applicant was the sponsor named in the Form FDA&hyph;1571 for an investigational new drug application (IND)
under which the new clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its application was conducted,
identification of the IND by number. If the applicant was not the sponsor of the IND under which the clinical investigation(s)
was conducted, a certification that the applicant or its predecessor in interest provided substantial support for
the clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its application, and information supporting
the certification. To demonstrate ``substantial support,'' an applicant must either provide a certified statement
from a certified public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study
or provide an explanation of why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant's
financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new
drug. A predecessor in interest is an entity, e.g., a corporation, that the applicant has taken over, merged with,
or purchased, or from which the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of nonexclusive rights to
a clinical investigation after it is completed is not sufficient to satisfy this definition.

Public disclosure of patent information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA will publish in the list the patent number and expiration date of each patent that is required to be, and is, submitted
to FDA by an applicant, and for each use patent, the approved indications or other conditions of use covered by a patent.
FDA will publish such patent information upon approval of the application, or, if the patent information is submitted
by the applicant after approval of an application as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as soon as possible
after the submission to the agency of the patent information. Patent information submitted by the last working day
of a month will be published in that month's supplement to the list. Patent information received by the agency between
monthly publication of supplements to the list will be placed on public display in FDA's Freedom of Information Staff.
A request for copies of the file shall be sent in writing to the Freedom of Information Staff (HFI&hyph;35), Food and
Drug Administration, rm. 12A&hyph;16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Correction of patent information errors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any person disputes the accuracy or relevance of patent information submitted to the agency under this section
and published by FDA in the list, or believes that an applicant has failed to submit required patent information, that
person must first notify the agency in writing stating the grounds for disagreement. Such notification should be
directed to the Drug Information Services Branch (HFD&hyph;84), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and
Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The agency will then request of the applicable new drug
application holder that the correctness of the patent information or omission of patent information be confirmed.
Unless the application holder withdraws or amends its patent information in response to FDA's request, the agency
will not change the patent information in the list. If the new drug application holder does not change the patent information
submitted to FDA, a 505(b)(2) application or an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the act submitted
for a drug that is claimed by a patent for which information has been submitted must, despite any disagreement as to
the correctness of the patent information, contain an appropriate certification for each listed patent.

Late submission of patent information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a patent on the listed drug is issued and the holder of the approved application for the listed drug does not submit
the required information on the patent within 30 days of issuance of the patent, an applicant who submitted an abbreviated
new drug application for that drug that contained an appropriate patent certification before the submission of the
patent information is not required to submit an amended certification. An applicant whose abbreviated new drug application
is submitted after a late submission of patent information, or whose pending abbreviated application was previously
submitted but did not contain an appropriate patent certification at the time of the patent submission, shall submit
a certification under paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this section or a statement under paragraph (a)(12)(iii) of this section
as to that patent.

Amended certifications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A certification submitted under paragraphs (a)(12)(i) through (a)(12)(iii) of this section may be amended at any
time before the effective date of the approval of the application. However, an applicant who has submitted a paragraph
IV patent certification may not change it to a paragraph III certification if a patent infringement suit has been filed
against another paragraph IV applicant unless the agency has determined that no applicant is entitled to 180-day
exclusivity or the patent expires before the lawsuit is resolved or expires after the suit is resolved but before the
end of the 180-day exclusivity period. If an applicant with a pending application voluntarily makes a patent certification
for an untimely filed patent, the applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed patent.
An applicant shall submit an amended certification by letter or as an amendment to a pending application or by letter
to an approved application. Once an amendment or letter is submitted, the application will no longer be considered
to contain the prior certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a patent is removed from the list, any applicant with a pending application (including a tentatively approved application
with a delayed effective date) who has made a certification with respect to such patent shall amend its certification.
The applicant shall certify under paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section that no patents described in paragraph (a)(12)(i)
of this section claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, shall amend the certification to refer
only to those relevant patents. In the amendment, the applicant shall state the reason for the change in certification
(that the patent is or has been removed from the list). A patent that is the subject of a lawsuit under &sect;314.107(c)
shall not be removed from the list until FDA determines either that no delay in effective dates of approval is required
under that section as a result of the lawsuit, that the patent has expired, or that any such period of delay in effective
dates of approval is ended. An applicant shall submit an amended certification. Once an amendment or letter for the
change has been submitted, the application will no longer be considered to be one containing a certification under
paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)(4) of this section.

patent infringement within 45 days of receipt by the patent owner of the notice of certification from the applicant
under &sect;314.52 or &sect;314.95, approval may be made effective 30 months after the date of the receipt of the notice
of certification by the patent owner or by the exclusive licensee (or their representatives) unless the court has
extended or reduced the period because of a failure of either the plaintiff or defendant to cooperate reasonably in
expediting the action; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the patented drug product qualifies for 5 years of exclusive marketing under &sect;314.108(b)(2) and the patent

(ii) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court issues a final order
that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court enters
judgment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court issues a final order
or judgment that the patent has been infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court determines that
the patent will expire or otherwise orders; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court grants a preliminary
injunction prohibiting the applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of the drug product until
the court decides the issues of patent validity and infringement, and if the court later decides that the patent is
invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court enters a final order
or judgment that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In order for an approval to be made effective under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the applicant must receive
an approval letter from the agency indicating that the application has received final approval. Tentative approval
of an application does not constitute ``approval'' of an application and cannot, absent a final approval letter from
the agency, result in an effective approval under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the applicant has submitted certifications under &sect;314.50(i) or &sect;314.94(a)(12) for more than one patent,
the date of approval will be calculated for each certification, and the approval will become effective on the last
applicable date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subsequent abbreviated new drug application submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If an abbreviated new drug application contains a certification that a relevant patent is invalid, unenforceable,
or will not be infringed and the application is for a generic copy of the same listed drug for which one or more substantially
complete abbreviated new drug applications were previously submitted containing a certification that the same
patent was invalid, unenforceable, or would not be infringed and the applicant submitting the first application
has successfully defended against a suit for patent infringement brought within 45 days of the patent owner's receipt
of notice submitted under &sect;314.95, approval of the subsequent abbreviated new drug application will be made
effective no sooner than 180 days from whichever of the following dates is earlier: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The date the applicant submitting the first application first commences commercial marketing of its drug product;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date of a decision of the court holding the relevant patent invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the ``applicant submitting the first application'' is the applicant
that submits an application that is both substantially complete and contains a certification that the patent was
invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed prior to the submission of any other application for the same listed drug
that is both substantially complete and contains the same certification. A ``substantially complete'' application
must contain the results of any required bioequivalence studies, or, if applicable, a request for a waiver of such
studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if FDA concludes that the applicant submitting the first application
is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application, FDA will make the approval of subsequent abbreviated
applications immediately effective if they are otherwise eligible for an immediately effective approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the applicant submitting the first application shall, if
sued for patent infringement, notify FDA of the date that it commences commercial marketing of its drug product. Commercial
marketing commences with the first date of introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce outside
the control of the manufacturer of a drug product, except for investigational use under part 312 of this chapter, but
does not include transfer of the drug product for reasons other than sale within the control of the manufacturer or
application holder. If an applicant does not promptly notify FDA of such date, the effective date of approval shall
be deemed to be the date of the commencement of first commercial marketing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Delay due to exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency will also delay the effective date of the approval of an abbreviated new drug application under section
505(j) of the act or a 505(b)(2) application if delay is required by the exclusivity provisions in &sect;314.108.
When the effective date of an application is delayed under both this section and &sect;314.108, the effective date
will be the later of the 2 days specified under this section and &sect;314.108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Court actions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) References to actions of ``the court'' in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are to the court that enters final
judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of establishing the effective date of approval based on a court judgment, the following dates shall
be deemed to be the date of the final decision of the court on the patent issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the decision
is not appealed, the date on which the right to appeal lapses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the decision
is appealed, the date of the first decision or order by a higher court holding or affirming the decision of the district
court that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is infringed, and the decision is appealed, the date on
which the district court enters a judgment that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed pursuant to
a mandate issued by a court of appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The applicant shall submit a copy of the entry of the order or judgment to the Office of Generic Drugs (HFD&hyph;600),
or to the appropriate division in the Office of Drug Evaluation I (HFD&hyph;100) or Office of Drug Evaluation II (HFD&hyph;500),
whichever is applicable, within 10 working days of a final judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computation of 45-day time clock. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The 45-day clock described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section begins on the day after the date of receipt of the
applicant's notice of certification by the patent owner or its representative, and by the approved application holder.
When the 45th day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the 45th day will be the next day that is not a Saturday,
Sunday, or a Federal holiday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The abbreviated new drug applicant or the 505(b)(2) applicant shall notify FDA immediately of the filing of any
legal action filed within 45 days of receipt of the notice of certification. If the applicant submitting the abbreviated
new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application or patent owner or its representative does not notify FDA in writing
before the expiration of the 45-day time period or the completion of the agency's review of the application, whichever
occurs later, that a legal action for patent infringement was filed within 45 days of receipt of the notice of certification,
approval of the abbreviated new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application will be made effective immediately
upon expiration of the 45 days or upon completion of the agency's review and approval of the application, whichever
is later. The notification to FDA of the legal action shall include:

court on a specified date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant of an abbreviated new drug application shall send the notification to FDA's Office of Generic Drugs
(HFD&hyph;600). A 505(b)(2) applicant shall send the notification to the appropriate division in the Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research reviewing the application. A patent owner or its representative may also notify FDA
of the filing of any legal action for patent infringement. The notice should contain the information and be sent to
the offices or divisions described in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the patent owner or approved application holder who is an exclusive patent licensee waives its opportunity
to file a legal action for patent infringement within 45 days of a receipt of the notice of certification and the patent
owner or approved application holder who is an exclusive patent licensee submits to FDA a valid waiver before the 45
days elapse, approval of the abbreviated new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application will be made effective
upon completion of the agency's review and approval of the application. FDA will only accept a waiver in the following
form:

Definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following definitions of terms apply to this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Active moiety 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt
(including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate,
or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approved under section 505(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means an application submitted under section 505(b) and approved on or after October 10, 1962, or an application that
was ``deemed approved'' under section 107(c)(2) of Pub. L. 87&hyph;781. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clinical investigation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means any experiment other than a bioavailability study in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used on,
human subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conducted or sponsored by the applicant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
with regard to an investigation means that before or during the investigation, the applicant was named in Form FDA&hyph;1571
filed with FDA as the sponsor of the investigational new drug application under which the investigation was conducted,
or the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in interest, provided substantial support for the investigation.
To demonstrate ``substantial support,'' an applicant must either provide a certified statement from a certified
public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study or provide an explanation
why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant's financial contribution
to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new drug. A predecessor in
interest is an entity, e.g., a corporation, that the applicant has taken over, merged with, or purchased, or from which
the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of nonexclusive rights to a clinical investigation after
it is completed is not sufficient to satisfy this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Date of approval 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the date on the letter from FDA stating that the new drug application is approved, whether or not final printed
labeling or other materials must yet be submitted as long as approval of such labeling or materials is not expressly
required. ``Date of approval'' refers only to a final approval and not to a tentative approval that may become effective
at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Essential to approval 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means, with regard to an investigation, that there are no other data available that could support approval of the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New chemical entity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other application submitted under section
505(b) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New clinical investigation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an investigation in humans the results of which have not been relied on by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence
of effectiveness of a previously approved drug product for any indication or of safety for a new patient population
and do not duplicate the results of another investigation that was relied on by the agency to demonstrate the effectiveness
or safety in a new patient population of a previously approved drug product. For purposes of this section, data from
a clinical investigation previously submitted for use in the comprehensive evaluation of the safety of a drug product
but not to support the effectiveness of the drug product would be considered new.

 This interim final rule implements recent amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) by amending
the regulations implementing the MMPA to authorize, pursuant to a General Authorization for Scientific Research,
the harassment of marine mammals in the wild for purposes of bona fide scientific research, that does not have the potential
to injure marine mammals (Level B harassment).

) places a moratorium on the taking and importing of marine mammals by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction with limited
exceptions. One exception is for the taking or importing of marine mammals for purposes of scientific research. The
MMPA Amendments of 1994 (1994 Amendments), enacted on April 30, 1994 (P.L. 103&hyph;238), among other things, require
that, within 120 days of enactment, NMFS issue a General Authorization for Scientific Research and implementing
regulations allowing takings of marine mammals in the wild for purposes of bona fide scientific research by no more
than Level B harassment (pursuit, torment, or annoyance of marine mammals that does not have the potential to injure
marine mammals). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 120-day deadline requires that this General Authorization be issued by interim final rule without prior notice
and opportunity for prior public comment. Comments on the General Authorization and implementing regulations are
invited and will be considered in issuing a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Level B harassment is defined as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to disturb a marine
mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited
to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering but does not have the potential to injure a marine
mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild. Level A harassment is defined as any act which has the potential to injure
a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild. In general, except for small take authorizations for harassment
under section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, a permit is required to take by Level A harassment. And, a permit is also required
to hunt, capture, or kill marine mammals for the purposes of scientific research, public display, or enhancing the
survival or recovery of a species or stock, or to take by Level B harassment for photography for educational or commercial
purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposed revised permit regulations published on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53320), NMFS proposed consolidating
three sets of permit regulations that have been implemented under the MMPA, the Fur Seal Act of 1966 (FSA) (16 U.S.C.
1151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). This interim final rule revises the permit sections of the implementing regulations of the FSA (50 CFR part 215)
to reference MMPA permit regulations (50 CFR part 216, subpart D) as the applicable regulations for the taking of North
Pacific fur seals for scientific research or exhibition purposes. The FSA permit regulations are also revised to
allow the taking of North Pacific fur seals involving only Level B harassment for the purpose of scientific research
under this interim final rule. (Note: North Pacific fur seals (Pribilof Island population) have been designated
as depleted under the MMPA.)

Collection of Certain Marine Mammal Parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In enacting the 1994 Amendments it was the apparent intent of Congress to allow under a General Authorization the conduct
of scientific research activities involving certain low-impact types of taking of marine mammals in the wild, with
the goal of making a permit unnecessary for scientific research involving types of taking that do not have the potential
to injure marine mammals or marine mammal stocks. NMFS believes that such types of low-impact taking include the collection
of tissues, fluids, or other marine mammal parts sloughed, excreted, or otherwise discharged naturally by marine
mammals in the wild, where such collection may not necessarily involve the harassment of living marine mammals in
the wild. Accordingly, NMFS is amending &sect;216.26 of the implementing regulations (50 CFR part 216) to allow for
purposes of bona fide scientific research, without issuance of a permit, the collection of any tissues, fluids or
other marine mammal parts naturally sloughed, excreted or otherwise discharged by a living marine mammal in the wild.
Section 216.26 is also amended to: (1) Ensure that requirements for the registration, identification, transfer,
or other possession of such marine mammal parts are consistent with those already established for parts salvaged
from beached or stranded marine mammals (&sect;216.22(c)); (2) require that, in registering such marine mammal
parts, the person collecting the part must also state the scientific research purpose for which the part was collected;
and (3) prohibit the sale or trade of any such marine mammal part for commercial purposes.

Discussion of General Authorization and Implementing Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The implementing regulations for the General Authorization are organized into five parts: (1) The General Authorization
and the types of activities covered; (2) letter of intent requirements; (3) procedures for confirming that the General
Authorization applies or notifying the applicant that a permit is required; (4) the terms and conditions applicable
to activities conducted under the General Authorization, including reporting requirements; and (5) the circumstances
under which NMFS may suspend, revoke, or modify the authority to conduct scientific research under the General Authorization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Activities Included Under the General Authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Research activities that are likely to involve only Level B harassment of marine mammals, and therefore that may be
conducted under the General Authorization consistent with the requirements of these regulations, include: Photo-identification
studies; behavioral observations; vessel surveys; and aerial surveys over water or land, and over pinniped rookeries
if flown at altitudes greater than 1,000 ft (305 meters (m)). These activities are listed in &sect;216.45(a)(3).
This list may be expanded as new information becomes available and NMFS determines that other types of research activities
are likely to involve only Level B harassment. Comment is requested regarding what other types of research activities
are likely to involve only Level B harassment (i.e., no potential to injure) and can be clearly and uniquely categorized
as such in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Authorization also applies to persons issued a scientific research permit under the ESA that authorizes
the taking by Level B harassment of marine mammals listed as threatened or endangered. An ESA permit holder authorized
to conduct Level B harassment is not required to submit a separate letter of intent. Such Level B activities are included
under the MMPA General Authorization for Scientific Research and no letter of confirmation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Activities Not Included Under the General Authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in section 2(b) of the 1994 Amendments, ``Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act is
intended to amend, repeal, or otherwise affect any other provision of law.'' Thus, marine mammals listed as endangered
or threatened under the ESA may be taken for purposes of scientific research only after issuance of a permit for such
activities pursuant to the ESA (50 CFR part 222). And, except for Level B harassment, other types of taking of marine
mammals listed as threatened or endangered that are authorized under an ESA permit for scientific research are not
authorized under the General Authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research activities involving the harassment of marine mammals in the wild that have the potential to injure a marine
mammal (Level A harassment) are not covered by the General Authorization. They may be conducted only pursuant to a
scientific research permit. Likewise, activities that involve the hunting, capturing, or killing of marine mammals
for the purposes of scientific research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock,
or taking by Level B harassment for photography for educational or commercial purposes, are not covered by the General
Authorization and require a permit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although most population surveys are likely to involve only Level B harassment or no harassment at all, pinniped rookeries
are an area of concern because many pinniped species stampede into the water when startled or otherwise threatened
by a potential predator or by human activity. When a stampede occurs in a haulout area (in the non-reproductive season),
it generally does not involve a potential injury, but in a rookery situation, a stampede has the potential to injure
pups. The 1,000 ft (305 m) threshold for aerial surveys over pinniped rookeries serves as an objective standard that
may be used to determine whether such research may be conducted under the General Authorization or may involve potential
injury to marine mammals (i.e., Level A harassment) and, therefore, require a permit. In this regard, NMFS is interested
in comments on whether different species-specific aerial survey altitudes or methods associated with minimal disturbance
have been established definitively in the scientific literature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of simplicity and predictability, the interim final rule limits research activities that may be conducted
under the General Authorization to only those types listed in &sect;216.45(a)(3). In preparing this interim final
rule, however, NMFS considered including provisions that would have allowed research activities other than those
types listed in &sect;216.45(a)(3) to be included under the General Authorization; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That in the letter of intent the applicant described the activity and furnished supporting documentation sufficient
for NMFS to determine that the activity likely would involve only Level B harassment. For example, although bleach
marking of pinnipeds in the wild is a type of research that could injure marine mammals (Level A harassment), if the
activity is being conducted by an experienced researcher using only non-toxic bleaching agents and proven direct
application methods on a species for which there is an established record of tolerance of such methods without any
disturbance with potential to injure (e.g., Northern elephant seals, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mirounga angustirostris
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), NMFS, upon receipt of a letter of intent containing sufficient documentation, could determine such activity likely
would involve only Level B harassment and that the activity could be conducted under the General Authorization. NMFS
is requesting comment on whether the final rule should include such flexibility; i.e., allow persons to conduct,
under the General Authorization, a research activity that has not been listed in the regulations as a type of research
likely to involve only Level B harassment, if sufficient documentation is submitted to NMFS to make a determination
that the activity is bona fide scientific research and does not involve the potential to injure marine mammals or marine
mammal stocks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant submitting a letter of intent to conduct scientific research under the General Authorization must be
the principal investigator, or the appropriate institution, government entity, or corporation responsible for
the supervision of the principal investigator. If the research involves co-investigators, a single principal investigator,
who will be primarily responsible for the research to be conducted under the General Authorization, must submit the
letter of intent, with all co-investigators identified as such. Identification of both principal and co-investigators
ensures accountability for activities conducted under the General Authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons conducting an activity under the authority of the General Authorization must possess qualifications
(e.g., education or experience) commensurate with their duties and responsibilities, or must be under the direct
supervision of a person with such qualifications. Applicants must enclose with the letter of intent, curricula vitae
for themselves and any co-investigators that may conduct research activities under the General Authorization.
NMFS will consider this information in determining whether the research as described in the letter of intent can be
expected to be conducted in a manner involving no more than Level B harassment of marine mammals or marine mammal stocks.

Letter of Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons intending to conduct a scientific research activity of the type listed in &sect;216.45 (a)(3) under the General
Authorization must submit, at least 60 days before commencement of such research, a letter of intent by certified
return/receipt mail to the Chief, Permits Division, F/PR1, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226. Persons issued an ESA scientific research permit authorizing the take
of marine mammals in the wild by Level B harassment, however, need not submit a letter of intent. Those Level B activities
are covered by the General Authorization, and no letter of confirmation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All letters of intent must include the name, address, telephone number, qualifications, and experience of the applicant
(i.e., principal investigator) and any co-investigator(s). Curricula vitae must be provided for each, including
a list of publications by such investigator relevant to the objectives, methodology, or other aspects of the proposed
research. Each letter of intent must be signed, dated, and include the certification statement specified at &sect;216.45(b)(3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each letter of intent must include brief statements responsive to the information requirements of section 104(c)(3)(C)
of the MMPA: The species or stocks of marine mammals (common and scientific names) that are the subject of the scientific
research and any other species or stock of marine mammals that may be harassed during the conduct of the research; the
geographic location(s) in which the research is to be conducted, e.g., geographic name or lat./long.; the period(s)
of time over which the research will be conducted (up to 5 years), including the field season(s) for the research, if
applicable; the purpose of the research, including a description of how the proposed research qualifies as bona fide
research; and the methods to be used to conduct the research.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No later than 30 days after receipt of a letter of intent, NMFS will issue a letter to the applicant either: Confirming
that the General Authorization applies, notifying the applicant that all or part of the proposed research does not
qualify for the General Authorization and that a scientific research permit is required, or notifying the applicant
that the letter of intent was insufficient to determine whether the General Authorization applies and identifying
the deficiencies to enable the applicant to revise and resubmit the letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and Committee of Scientific Advisors were established under Title II of the MMPA
to, among other things, review applications for permits for the taking or import of marine mammals and provide comment
and recommendations to NMFS. Although the 1994 Amendments do not provide for the involvement of either the MMC or the
Committee of Scientific Advisors in the General Authorization for Scientific Research, a copy of each letter of intent
and NMFS' response will be forwarded to the MMC. This will allow the MMC to review all research activities involving
marine mammals, including research conducted under the General Authorization.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to ensure that research activities conducted under the General Authorization do not either individually
or cumulatively result in takes other than by Level B harassment, NMFS plans to coordinate and monitor research activities.
Monitoring will be accomplished, in part, through NMFS and MMC review of required annual reports. Coordination of
research activities will be accomplished, in part, by requiring persons conducting research under the General Authorization
to notify the appropriate NMFS Regional Office(s) at least 2 weeks before initiation of on-site activities. The Regional
Office(s) will review these notifications and coordinate upcoming research to minimize adverse impacts on marine
mammals in the wild. Where appropriate, Regional Offices may convene meetings to coordinate research under the General
Authorization. In the event of any circumstance where research activities result in a taking which exceeds Level
B harassment, for example, in the case of potential or actual injury to or death of a marine mammal or marine mammal stocks
in the wild, research activities must be immediately discontinued and the principal investigator must notify NMFS.
NMFS will determine whether: The research activity in question may continue under the General Authorization; revision
of the research methodology is necessary to remove any potential to injure marine mammals or marine mammal stocks;
or, a permit is necessary to continue the research. The reporting of such incidents is a condition of conducting research
under the General Authorization. Similarly, in certain instances (e.g., reports of abuse of the General Authorization),
it may be necessary for a NMFS observer to monitor research activities directly. Therefore, a condition of conducting
research under the General Authorization is that, upon notification, the principal investigator must allow a NMFS
observer to observe research activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons conducting research under the General Authorization must submit annual reports of activity. This information
will be used to monitor the effects of the activities on individual animals and their populations, to assess possible
cumulative impacts, and to determine whether the activity is being conducted as described in the letter of intent.
Annual reports will also be used to track the progress of the research, to determine whether the research continues
to meet the bona fide requirement, and to allow for coordination with similar research in the same area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Photography (e.g., still photography, videotaping, and motion picture filming) often will be one of the methodologies
employed by researchers engaged in scientific research under the General Authorization. Such photography does
not require a photography permit issued under the MMPA provided the primary use of the resulting images will be for
the conduct of the research or presenting or publishing the results. In such case, such images may be incidentally
used for other scientific, educational, or commercial purposes provided the names of all photographers are disclosed
in the annual report and any photographs, videotape, or film obtained during the conduct of research under the General
Authorization are identified by a statement that refers to the General Authorization and includes the file number
provided by NMFS in the confirmation letter, the name of the photographer, and the date the image was taken. This statement
must accompany the image(s) in all subsequent uses or sales. The annual report must note incidental scientific, educational,
or commercial uses of the images. However, if the primary use of the images will be for educational or commercial use,
a separate photography permit must first be obtained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
NOAA, (AA) finds there is a good cause to waive prior notice and opportunity to comment on this rule. It is contrary to
public interest to provide prior notice and opportunity for comment because of the deadline for implementation mandated
by the 1994 Amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 553(d) of the APA, the AA finds there is good cause to waive the required 30-day delay in the effective
date. Any delay in this action would deny timely coverage by the General Authorization to qualified persons. This
General Authorization grants an exception from the MMPA requirement to obtain a scientific research permit for the
taking of marine mammals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule involves an existing collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act that has been approved by OMB (control number 0648&hyph;0084). The burden for collection of that information
was estimated to average 43 hours per response, including the time to complete permit applications, complete reporting
requirements, and request subsequent modifications or authorizations. The public reporting burden for the collection-of-information
associated with the General Authorization established under the current rule is estimated to average 17 hours per
response. Send any comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these requirements, including
suggestions for reducing the burden to NMFS and OMB (see

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments add comprehensive crash resistant fuel system design and test criteria to the airworthiness standards
for normal and transport category rotorcraft. Application of these standards will minimize fuel spillage near ignition
sources and potential ignition sources and, therefore, will improve the evacuation time needed for crew and passengers
to escape a post-crash fire (PCF). Implementation of these amendments will minimize the PCF hazard saving lives and
substantially reducing the severity of physiological injuries sustained from PCF's in otherwise survivable accidents.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments are based on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 90&hyph;24, issued September 27, 1990 (55
FR 41000, October 5, 1990). A correction to the NPRM was published on December 11, 1990 (55 FR 50931).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Post-crash fires (PCF's) are the primary cause of fatalities and injuries in otherwise survivable impacts resulting
from rotorcraft accidents. It is estimated that 5 percent of the occupants in survivable rotorcraft accidents are
killed or injured by PCF's annually. These types of fatalities and traumatic injuries will be substantially reduced
by the implementation of the design and test criteria of this amendment. Nearly all PCF's are caused by crash-induced
fuel leaks that quickly come in contact with ignition sources during or after impact. The fuel containment and hazard
elimination provisions contained in this amendment will, in the majority of cases, give occupants the time necessary
to escape a survivable crash before a post-crash fire (PCF) could become life threatening. A crash resistant fuel
system (CRFS) would not be expected to prevent all fires; however, a CRFS would, in the majority of survivable accidents,
either prevent a PCF or delay the massive fire, or fireball, long enough to allow the occupants to escape. These standards
have been validated by military safety statistics as significantly minimizing the PCF hazard and its associated
fatalities and injuries.

General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirteen commenters, including representatives from small and large U.S. helicopter manufacturers, foreign airworthiness
authorities, and foreign helicopter manufacturers, commented on the NPRM. All commenters agree with the FAA that
CFRS installations will improve occupant survivability in parts 27 and 29 rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters fully support all of the proposals. No commenter opposes adoption of the proposed amendments.
One commenter proposes adoption of more stringent standards, and several commenters offer other counterproposals
and recommendations for specific proposals.

General Comments on the Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless specifically noted otherwise, the comments and responses apply to both proposed &sect;&sect;27.952 and
29.952, since the requirements in both are identical.

The Use of the Term ``Flammable Fluid''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Flammable fluids other than fuel should not be included in the amendments, since all on-board light and heavy oil systems
are affected. Accordingly, the commenter proposes that ``flammable fluid'' be changed to ``fuel.'' The FAA agrees
with this comment, and appropriate changes have been made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questions the accuracy of the economic analysis but offers no specific recommendations or corrections.
The FAA has reevaluated the analysis and found no changes were necessary based on this comment.

Rigidity of the Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter states that the proposed amendments are ``too rigid'' in their approach and limit the designers' choices.
The FAA disagrees. Although the 50-foot drop height and certain strength requirements are specific, these and most
of the other requirements do not mandate specific designs. Objective rules allow flexibility in showing compliance.
An example of this flexibility is that bladders are not mandated; the rule specifies only freedom from leakage after
impact. The amendments are intended to be as flexible as possible to allow design innovation while at the same time
requiring a specific safety standard for a CRFS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter states that the amendments include some very detailed requirements that are more appropriate for a Technical
Standard Order (TSO). The FAA agrees that some of the details proposed for paragraphs 27.952 (e) and (f) and 29.952
(e) and (f) should not be regulatory requirements, are more appropriate for an advisory circular, and should not be
part of the proposed standard. Therefore, those details have been removed and placed in the draft advisory material.
However, the FAA disagrees with the commenter that the level of detail either in the proposals or in the advisory material
would necessitate a CRFS TSO.

The Standardized Approach of the Proposals

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter believes that the standardized design and test approach of these amendments to CRFS certification, while
acceptable, is not as valid as the establishment of individual design criteria on a case-by-case basis followed by
a design review and a test program. However, the commenter offered no specific data or case histories to substantiate
this position. Since all past successful civil and military experience has been with a standardized design and test
approach, the FAA finds no historical or technical basis to support the commenter. Moreover, the FAA has determined
that a standardized design and test approach, when properly applied, still allows for adequate use of individual
design features that meet the specific safety standards.

A commenter expresses concern that the proposals are less stringent than the corresponding military standard because
of perceived differences in the military and civil environments. The commenter is especially concerned that fuel
tank bladders are not mandated. The commenter proposes verbatim adoption of the military standards. The FAA disagrees.
Based on independent studies, the General Aviation Safety Panel (GASP) committee recommendations, and past civil
CRFS service experience, the FAA has determined that the proposals, while less stringent than the military standard,
provide an equivalent level of safety considering the differences (such as violent atypical flight maneuvers, landing
maneuvers, and gunfire hazards) in the civil and military environments. While it is anticipated that most successful
fuel cell designs will involve the use of bladders, bladderless rigid designs (that provide the same level of safety
as designs with bladders) may be approved under the new standard.

A commenter questions the need for the specification of load factors in proposed &sect;27.516(d), since similar
load factors are specified in proposed &sect;27.952(b)(3). The FAA has determined that load factors are needed in
both &sect;&sect;27.561(d) and 27.952(b)(3). Section 27.561(d) applies to fuselage structure, and &sect;27.952(b)(3)
applies to fuel tanks. Although the load factors are identical, they are specified for different parts of the rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter correctly states that the load factors are clearly specified for fuel cells by their location on
the rotorcraft but asks which load factors are to be used for other major fuel system components. The load factors used
for each fuel cell location should be used for fuel cell components of significant mass in the same locations. Therefore,
this amendment is adopted as proposed.

All commenters support the proposed drop test, and most commenters favor the 50-foot drop height. However, two commenters
propose a reduction in the drop height for a bare fuel cell from 50 to 25 feet. Another commenter proposed a reduction
in drop height of a fuel cell test article configuration (i.e., a fuel cell installed in its representative airframe
structure) from 50 to 15 feet. Another commenter contends that since the military fuel cell drop test (and nearly 20
years of associated, successful safety experience) is at a 65-foot drop height, the proposed drop height should be
65 feet, not 50 feet. The proposed 50-foot drop height is based, in part, on an analysis of nearly 20 years of combined
military and civilian design and operational data. (The 15-foot reduction in drop height from the military standard
to the proposed civil standard equates their level of safety because of the elimination of the additional risks associated
with the military environment.) A significant part of this 20 years of data is based on approximately 1,500 civil rotorcraft
that have been certificated (on a voluntary, nonhazard basis) to design standards (including a 50-foot drop test)
analogous to these proposals. This 20 years of data and experience (from both the military and voluntary civil unit
installations) have resulted in a good operational safety record. This good safety record indicates that fuel tank
installations designed to these proposals (including the practical standard of a 50-foot drop height) successfully
minimize the post-crash fire hazard. Therefore, no change to the 50-foot drop height is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter proposes deletion of the requirement to drop the fuel cell in its surrounding structure. The same
commenter asks if the bare tank drop test will follow the procedure of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B when the surrounding
structure is free of projections or design features likely to contribute to tank ruptures. Another commenter states
that the requirement to drop a representative structure should be fully defined. The same commenter states that no
mention is made of production drop test requirements that would be made necessary by postproduction design changes
to either the fuel system or its surrounding structure. The FAA considers these suggested changes unnecessary because
(under Part 21) a design review (precipitated by a proposed design modification that affects the fuel cell-airframe
interface) would automatically require a review of the interface with regard to these proposed standards. If that
design review shows the surrounding structure is free of projections and hazards, the fuel cell may be dropped alone.
Additionally, MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B procedures may be used, except that the drop height is reduced to 50 feet.
Further, major post certification design changes, such as major changes to the fuel system cells or their locations,
automatically require recertification in accordance with FAR 21.93(a). Therefore, the amendments are adopted
as proposed.

A commenter notes that the proposed drop test criteria require that the fuel cell test article be filled 80 percent
with water with no mention of the contents of the other 20 percent. The commenter states that this is different from
part 23 Notice No. 85&hyph;7A (55 FR 7280, February 28, 1990) in that the proposed rotorcraft amendments do not require
the air to be removed from the fuel cell prior to the drop test. The commenter suggests that the best method of compensating
for the difference between the density of fuel and water is to leave the tank 100 percent full of fuel and adjust the drop
height to a lower value.

The FAA notes that the drop test criteria proposed in Notice 90&hyph;24 are the same as those proposed in part 23 Notice
85&hyph;7A and the same as those used to comply with MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B. There are standard, acceptable methods
of configuring (i.e., properly removing the air from) a soft flexible fuel cell, and there are standard, acceptable
methods of configuring (i.e., properly removing the air from) the vents on a rigid fuel cell. The air removal methods
intended by these proposals are the same as those used to comply with MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B and are accepted, industry
practice. It is impracticable to remove a significant amount of air from many rigid fuel cell designs by pulling a vacuum
without either inducing unacceptable stresses or causing structural failure. Extreme vacuum conditions inside
fuel tanks do not exist in practice. However, natural venting (involving partial vacuums) exists for rigid tanks
in a pre-crash, falling condition. A natural partial vacuum condition is intended to be duplicated for rigid tanks
by allowing normal vent function during the drop test. Flexible fuel cells will have the air removed by hand (i.e.,
by pushing out the air and resealing the bag) prior to the drop as is currently practiced by the industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method chosen to compensate for the density of water versus that of fuel (i.e., 80 percent full of water) is a standard
method. It is used successfully by the civil rotorcraft industry. The commenter's alternate method of reducing the
drop height has some merit but is not supported by current, known data.

A commenter notes that the amendments differ from MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B, in that the amendments require that the
tank be dropped in its surrounding structure, unless it is clearly shown that the structure is free from projections
and other such hazards. The commenter suggests that the FAA not adopt the requirement to drop the tank in the surrounding
structure. The FAA disagrees. The FAA concluded that in the interests of safety the tank should be dropped in its surrounding
structure. Only when all projections and other puncture hazards have been minimized by design will dropping a bare
fuel cell suffice to show compliance. The FAA's approach improves on the MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B criteria in that
an FAA-approved, documented certification design review will be required to minimize the surrounding airframe
projections and other puncture hazards prior to a bare tank drop test. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter states that the load factors proposed in these sections are redundant to those contained in structural
&sect;&sect;27.561 and 29.561(d), that no procedures to conduct these tests have been defined, and that the cost
of this type of testing is not addressed. Two other commenters question the need for specification of separate load
factors by rotorcraft zone (i.e., location) for fuel cells that exceed the standard airframe load factors. The FAA
disagrees that the proposed load factors are redundant. They are for fuel cells and major mass items in the fuel system
only. The load factors are to be used in standard structural analysis to structurally design the fuel cells, other
major fuel system mass items, and their attachments. No special tests, other than the required structural substantiation
tests are intended. No costs have been added since the required structural analysis and test programs are already
conducted during certification for these components to the current load factors. The separate load factor specification
by zone is necessary to provide proper crash resistance for occupant safety and PCF prevention for fuel system components
located in three selected zones of the rotorcraft. They also provide the designer with specific criteria (i.e., load
factors) for proper static analysis of fuel system components in these specific zones. The load factors proposed
by &sect;&sect;27.952(b) and 29.952(b) are for fuel system components only; whereas, the load factors of current
&sect;29.561(d) are for the airframe only. However, load factors for fuel system components and airframe components
are compatible.

removal to be necessary because this phrase is intended to minimize a ``mechanical'' ballistic hazard from fuel system
components and not a PCF hazard. The amendments, in the commenter's view, are only intended to minimize a PCF. The commenter's
presumption is incorrect. The amendments are intended to provide a CRFS. This includes preventing impact-induced,
ballistic hazards to fuel system components as well as PCF hazards. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter believes that the proposed amendments mandate self-sealing breakaway couplings and suggests that the
amendments be revised to include the words ``Where hazardous relative motion of fuel system components is likely
to exist during a crash, breakaway self-sealing couplings shall be required.'' Another commenter suggests that
no alternate, equivalent designs to breakaway fuel fittings be allowed by the amendments. A third commenter points
out that there is no mention of any pull-out strength requirements for fuel tank fittings as stated in MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B.
The amendments already express the intent of the wording suggested by the first commenter concerning hazardous relative
motion. Further, the FAA does not agree with the second comment that alternate, equivalent designs to breakaway fuel
fittings should not be allowed, since several proven, alternate, equivalent designs have already been approved.
Thus, alternate, equivalent designs for breakaway fuel fittings are acceptable. In response to the third commenter,
fitting strength and hose pull-out strength requirements of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B are industry practice and
are acceptable as one means of compliance. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(c)(2)(iii) and 29.952(c)(1)(iii) be changed to specify leakage
as one method of detecting an unlocked or otherwise faulty breakaway coupling. The FAA agrees that leakage is one method
of detecting an unlocked coupling but finds that the proposed wording of ``design provisions to visually ascertain''
adequately covers consideration of leakage as a means to verify locking of the couplings. Therefore, the amendments
are adopted as proposed.

after a breakaway coupling has performed its intended function. The FAA agrees with the intent of the comment but has
determined that this kind of detail is more appropriate in advisory guidance material. It is intended that industry
practice, which allows loss of entrapped fuel (up to 8 ounces) and fuel seepage (up to 5 drops per minute), be acceptable
after the valve has functioned. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

loads at the frangible or deformable attachment location.'' The FAA recognizes the large variance in industry design

A commenter states that the proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(1) and 29.952(e)(1) criteria largely repeat existing
criteria. The commenter provides several specific examples of the perceived repetition. Another commenter asks
why airframe mounted fuel filters are not acceptable in the engine compartment (i.e., fire zone) if engine mounted
filters are acceptable. The FAA maintains that the proposed sections relate to a post-crash configured rotorcraft,
that is radically different in terms of ignition sources, fuel leaks, and geometry than a pre-crash configured rotorcraft
even though similarities may exist. Prior to these proposed amendments, parts 27 and 29 applied only to pre-crash
(or flight) configured rotorcraft. Also, the proposed sections refer to the entire rotorcraft, not just specific
zones, such as the pre-crash configured exhaust system regulations that were cited by the commenter in a particular
example. However, because of this and other related comments, the FAA has decided to simplify the final rule by deleting
the proposed subsections relating to compliance methodology and moving the term ``occupiable areas'' from proposed
paragraphs e(4) to revised paragraphs (e).

A commenter states that the existing rules are adequate to ensure sufficient PCF protection for fuel tanks located
near occupiable areas. Therefore, from a practical view, sufficient separation cannot be economically achieved
to the extent that it would have a significant impact on preventing a PCF. Thus, the commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4)
and 29.952(e)(4) be removed. In contrast, the FAA believes that it is practical to enhance PCF safety through design
changes under proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4). For example, moving a fuel cell an additional
1/4 or more inches aft of an occupied volume (within the maximum practicable extent of a given design envelope) could
avoid a major, occupant-drenching, post-crash fuel spill (and potential PCF). This could be accomplished by simply
adding 1/4 or more inches of crushable, energy absorbing airframe distance between the occupied volume and the fuel
cell. Such a design decision would not need to be considered under the current standards. Under these proposals it
would have to be considered. As stated previously, &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4) have been removed
in order to simplify the final rule by deleting the compliance methodology. However, the requirement for separation
of fuel tanks from occupiable areas is adopted in &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e).

A commenter states that, under his interpretation, proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6) would
require firewalls to retain their sealing ability under the load factors of &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1) and 29.952(b)(1)).
The commenter believes that all large mass items, such as engines and cowlings, in the vicinity of the firewall would
have to be restrained to prevent impact-induced firewall ruptures (i.e., preserve postimpact sealing ability).
The commenter further believes that, based on other common design requirements such as fuel line penetrations of
firewalls, the proposed amendment is impractical. Another commenter concurs with the proposed firewall survivable
impact sealing retention requirement, but is concerned that a direct application of the proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1)
and 29.952(b)(1) load factors would produce a stiff, heavy firewall that, while able to retain sealing capability,
would be heavy, uneconomical, and not have the intended crash-resistant design features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters misinterpreted the intent of proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6). These proposals
are based on similar MIL&hyph;STD&hyph;1290 requirements that have been used in design for many years. The FAA does
not intend that a firewall designed to the load factors of &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1) and 29.952(b)(1) would retain
its complete sealing ability under all post-crash threats. Thus, some leakage around typical vent and line penetrations
and other small post-crash penetrations of the firewall in a survivable impact are acceptable. Unless an obvious,
catastrophic hazard would be created in a survivable impact by atypical design features, restraint of the engines
and cowling to prevent impact-induced firewall rupture was not intended. The FAA intends that the firewall retain
its sealing ability in a survivable impact. The most significant problem addressed during the firewall design is
deformation of the firewall induced by fuselage deformations under crash conditions.

The requirement can be met by a firewall of a low stiffness, ductile design that can withstand the maximum vertical,
lateral, and horizontal crushing displacements that are estimated to occur in a survivable impact. A low stiffness,
ductile design can efficiently accommodate crash-induced deformations without shearing fuel or electrical lines
and without rupturing or otherwise losing its gross sealing ability (i.e., creating a major ignition source or fire
path). A displacement based firewall certification test should be conducted that shows that it is capable of performing
its intended gross sealing function in a survivable impact. As stated previously, in order to simplify the final rule
by deleting the compliance methodology, new &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e) are adopted as revised, and proposed
&sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6) are removed.

A commenter recommends placing the detailed design criteria proposed by &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f) in
an advisory circular retaining only a shortened lead-in version of &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f). Another
commenter believes that &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f), while acceptable in principle, duplicate many current
FAR requirements and several other sections of 27.952 and 29.952. The commenter cited several examples of perceived
duplication. The FAA agrees with the first commenter's proposal to place detailed design criteria in the advisory
circular material. Therefore, proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(f)(1) through 27.952(f)(9) and 29.952(f)(1) through
29.952(f)(9) are removed. Sections 27.952(f) and 29.952(f) are revised to replace the proposed, detailed design
criteria specified after the phrase ``as follows:'' with a less detailed design criteria indicated by the phrase,''
*&blank;*&blank;* to be crash resistant *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, these amendments are adopted as revised.
Additionally, this revision answers the second commenter's perceived duplicity concerns.

Another commenter notes that the word `long' used in line 4 of &sect;29.952(f)(5) should be `along'. The FAA agrees
but no correction is necessary since this proposed paragraph was removed.

A commenter suggests that requirements for impact and tear resistance be included in the amendments. The commenter
correctly notes that the GASP report recommends specific impact and tear resistance values for civil rotorcraft
based on MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B requirements. The FAA agrees with the comment in general but notes that proposed
&sect;&sect;27.952(g) and 29.952(g) objectively requires that crash-resistant fuel cells be tear and impact resistant.
Further, it is intended that paragraphs 4.6.5.1 through 4.6.5.5 of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B (modified for the civil
environment) may be used to provide one acceptable method of properly assessing impact and tear resistance. Therefore,
the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter states full support for &sect;&sect;27.975(b) and 29.975(a)(7), which propose that the venting system
be designed to minimize spillage of fuel through the vents to an ignition source in the event of a rollover. However,
the comment suggests deletion of the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* is shown to be extremely improbable *&blank;*&blank;*''
because, in his view, in practical terms, it would be impossible for an applicant to demonstrate such a low probability.
The FAA agrees. The current term ``extremely remote'' rather than ``extremely improbable'' was intended. The FAA
has determined that ``extremely remote'' is the correct term. The amendments are adopted as proposed except for replacing
the word ``improbable'' with the word ``remote.''

Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain
current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a
``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly
defined exigencies, to determine if the rules constitute ``significant regulatory action.'' ``Significant regulatory
action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,
the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the
budgetary impact on entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. ``Significant regulatory action'' is submitted to centralized regulatory
review by OIRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not ``a significant regulatory action.'' However, a cost-benefit
analysis, including evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to this rule has been prepared. This analysis also
contains the regulatory flexibility determination required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and a Trade Impact
Assessment. If more detailed economic information is desired, the reader may refer to the full evaluation contained
in the docket.

Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Studies have shown that a significant PCF hazards exist in rotorcraft operations. In a study of rotorcraft crashworthiness
dynamics, the FAA found that burn fatalities and injuries account for about 14 percent of rotorcraft accident casualties
and occur in about 20 percent of the accidents in which there are injuries. In a study comparing rotorcraft equipped
with and without a CRFS, the U.S. Army found that average thermal casualty costs per survivable accident were 95.4
percent lower in CRFS-equipped rotorcraft, and that 50 percent of all rotorcraft accidents with a PCF are survivable
prior to the onset of fire. An FAA review of NTSB rotorcraft accident data from 1983 through 1987 shows that 295 accidents
occurred that involved a crash landing or collision with an object resulting in fatalities, serious injuries, or
combinations of fatalities and injuries. Sixty-three of these accidents involved a PCF, in which about 77 percent
of the occupants were fatally injured, as compared to 42 percent of the occupants in accidents not involving a PCF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 63 accidents involving a PCF, there were 113 fatalities, 27 serious injuries, 5 minor injuries, and one noninjury.
The FAA estimates that the use of CRFS's would have altered these casualty distributions to approximately the following:
83 fatalities, 31 serious injuries, 24 minor injuries, and 8 noninjuries_a difference of 30 fewer fatalities with
some of the fatalities being reduced to serious injuries (4) and minor injuries (19).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide the public and government officials with a benchmark comparison of the expected safety benefits
of rulemaking actions with estimated costs over an extended period of time, the FAA currently uses a minimum value
of $1.5 million to statistically represent an avoided fatality. Serious injuries are estimated to have an average
cost of $640,000, and minor injuries are estimated to have an average cost of $2,300. Applying these values to the calculated
differences yields benefits of about $42 million [(30 fewer fatalities &times; $1.5 million) ^ (4 more serious injuries
&times; $640,000) ^ (19 more minor injuries &times; $2,300)]. The average benefit per accident involving a PCF is
approximately $670,000. Accounting for parts 27 and 29 separately, the average benefits are approximately $464,000
per part 27 rotorcraft accident involving a PCF and approximately $1,638,000 per part 29 rotorcraft accident involving
a PCF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 5-year study period, an average of 5,450 part 27 rotorcraft and an average of 1,150 part 29 rotorcraft were
in operation in the United States. During this period, the annual probability of a part 27 rotorcraft being involved
in a serious survivable accident with a PCF is estimated to be 1.903 &times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ((52 accidents / 5,450 part 27 rotorcraft) / 5 years). The corresponding probability for part 29 rotorcraft is 1.913
&times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ((11 accidents / 1,150 part 29 rotorcraft) / 5 years). Multiplying these probabilities by an estimated benefits per
accident with a PCF yields annual benefits of $885 per part 27 rotorcraft and $3,134 per part 29 rotorcraft. Assuming
15-year operating lives, these benefits when discounted equate to $3,103 per part 27 rotorcraft and $10,985 per part
29 rotorcraft.

Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will increase costs for both rotorcraft manufacturers and operators. Manufacturers will incur increased
development, certification, and production costs; and operators (in addition to absorbing these costs in higher
rotorcraft acquisition costs) will incur increased operating costs due to the additional weight of the fuel system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates the development and certification costs per new rotorcraft certification will be $36,000. Most
of these costs are for testing, analysis, and documentation. The primary testing required by the rule is a test of each
fuel tank to show no loss of fuel under specified crash conditions. This can be accomplished by a simple, inexpensive
drop test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will be increased production costs associated with fuel tanks, fittings, and flexible fuel lines. The incremental
cost of a fuel tank meeting the requirements of the rule is estimated to be $30 per gallon of tank capacity. Part 27 rotorcraft
are assumed to have 50-gallon tanks that will cost $1,500 more as a result of this rule; part 29 rotorcraft are assumed
to have 200-gallon tanks costing $6,000 more. The FAA estimates that the cost per frangible, self-sealing fitting
is $60; that a typical part 27 rotorcraft will require 8 fittings, totaling $480; and that a typical part 29 rotorcraft
will require 10 fittings, totaling $600. Flexible fuel line sections are expected to add about $100 to the cost of a
fuel system for a part 27 rotorcraft and about $150 for a part 29 rotorcraft. The estimated total incremental production
costs are $2,080 per part 27 rotorcraft and $6,750 per part 29 rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that the rule will increase the weight of a part 27 rotorcraft by 9.5 pounds and a part 29 rotorcraft
by 33 pounds, and that each extra pound of weight increases average annual fuel consumption by 3.8 gallons per part
27 rotorcraft and 6.2 gallons per part 29 rotorcraft. Applying fuel prices of $1.87 per gallon for part 27 rotorcraft
and $1.78 for part 29 rotorcraft, the estimated increase in average annual operating costs is $68 ($1.87 &times; 3.8
gals. &times; 9.5 lbs.) per part 27 rotorcraft and $364 ($1.78 &times; 6.2 gals. &times; 33 lbs.) per part 29 rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming 15 years operating lives, the total incremental development, certification, production, and operating
costs when discounted are $1,426 per part 27 rotorcraft and $4,617 per part 29 rotorcraft.

Benefit/Costs Comparison

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits exceed costs for both parts 27 and 29 rotorcraft. The net present value (discounted benefits minus discounted
costs) is $1,677 per part 27 rotorcraft and $6,368 per part 29 rotorcraft. The rule will be cost beneficial even if it
is only 50 percent effective in eliminating PCF fatalities and injuries.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
if a rule is expected to have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, prescribes standards for complying with RFA review requirements
in FAA rulemaking actions. The FAA does not expect the rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small manufacturers or operators.

Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule will have no impact on trade for either U.S. firms doing business in foreign markets or foreign firms doing
business in the United States. In the United States, foreign manufacturers must meet U.S. requirements, and thus
will gain no competitive advantage. In foreign countries, U.S. manufacturers are not bound by parts 27 and 29 requirements
and can choose whether or not to implement the provisions of this rule on the basis of competitive and other considerations.
Also, the Joint Airworthiness Authority (JAA) and Transport Canada are both in the process of adopting this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and
the Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that these amendments are not major under Executive Order 12866.
In addition, the FAA certifies that these amendments do not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. These amendments
are considered nonsignificant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatory
evaluation of the amendments, including a Regulatory Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in
the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;10), Docket No. 26392, 800 Independence

Except for fuel tanks located so that tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, such
as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed
and installed to retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, acting alone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fuel line self-sealing breakaway couplings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Self-sealing breakaway couplings must be installed unless hazardous relative motion of fuel system components
to each other or to local rotorcraft structure is demonstrated to be extremely improbable or unless other means are
provided. The couplings or equivalent devices must be installed at all fuel tank-to-fuel line connections, tank-to-tank
interconnects, and at other points in the fuel system where local structural deformation could lead to the release
of fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The design and construction of self-sealing breakaway couplings must incorporate the following design features:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure
load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line. The separation load must in no case
be less than 300 pounds, regardless of the size of the fluid line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A breakaway coupling must separate whenever its ultimate load (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section)
is applied in the failure modes most likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to visually ascertain that the coupling is locked
together (leak-free) and is open during normal installation and service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to prevent uncoupling or unintended closing due
to operational shocks, vibrations, or accelerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) No breakaway coupling design may allow the release of fuel once the coupling has performed its intended function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All individual breakaway couplings, coupling fuel feed systems, or equivalent means must be designed, tested,
installed, and maintained so that inadvertent fuel shutoff in flight is improbable in accordance with &sect;27.955(a)
and must comply with the fatigue evaluation requirements of &sect;27.571 without leaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Alternate, equivalent means to the use of breakaway couplings must not create a survivable impact-induced load
on the fuel line to which it is installed greater than 25 to 50 percent of the ultimate load (strength) of the weakest
component in the line and must comply with the fatigue requirements of &sect;27.571 without leaking.

Frangible or deformable structural attachments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unless hazardous relative motion of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure is demonstrated
to be extremely improbable in an otherwise survivable impact, frangible or locally deformable attachments of fuel
tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure must be used. The attachment of fuel tanks and fuel
system components to local rotorcraft structure, whether frangible or locally deformable, must be designed such
that its separation or relative local deformation will occur without rupture or local tear-out of the fuel tank or
fuel system components that will cause fuel leakage. The ultimate strength of frangible or deformable attachments
must be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The load required to separate a frangible attachment from its support structure, or deform a locally deformable
attachment relative to its support structure, must be between 25 and 50 percent of the minimum ultimate load (ultimate
strength) of the weakest component in the attached system. In no case may the load be less than 300 pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A frangible or locally deformable attachment must separate or locally deform as intended whenever its ultimate
load (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is applied in the modes most likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

arrangement for the spaces between the liner and its container must maintain the proper relationship to tank vent
pressures for any expected flight condition.

In addition_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each filler must be marked as prescribed in &sect;27.1557(c)(1);

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends the operational guidelines of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 101 for model rockets
that: use not more than 125 grams (4.4 ounces) of propellant; are made of paper, wood, or breakable plastic; contain
no substantial metal parts; and weigh not more than 1,500 grams (53 ounces). This amendment is necessary to provide
for the operation of the technologically advanced, larger category, model rockets and to ensure that their operation
is in concert with the maximum level of safety protection for aircraft, flight crews, and the flying public. The FAA
believes that this amendment will foster important aeronautical education and research activities, while retaining
appropriate operational safety precautions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On May 28, 1985, the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and the Hobby Industry Association (HIA) filed a joint
petition requesting that the FAA amend 14 CFR 101.1, by raising the upper weight limit on excepted model rockets from
16 ounces to 1,500 grams (approximately 53 ounces) and the allowable propellant mass from 4 ounces to 125 grams (approximately
4.4 ounces). At present, 14 CFR 101.1 exempts ``model'' rockets having no more than 4.0 ounces of propellant and weighing
no more than 16 ounces, including the propellent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the NAR/HIA joint petition, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), Notice 92&hyph;12,
57 FR 41628, Sep. 10, 1992. Notice 92&hyph;12 proposed to amend 14 CFR Part 101 by adding &sect;101.22, Special provisions
for larger model rockets, and by amending &sect;101.25, Notice requirements, to accommodate larger model rockets.
In summary, model rockets that use not more than 125 grams of propellant; that weigh not more than 1,500 grams, including
the propellant; that are constructed principally of paper, wood, or breakable plastic, and continue to have no substantial
metal parts; may be operated in a controlled airspace, within 5 miles of the boundary of any airport, within 1,500 feet
of any person or property that is not associated with the operations or at night. These operations may be conducted,
provided that persons operating these model rockets give prior notification of launch activities and other pertinent
launch information to the FAA Air Traffic Control (ATC) facility nearest the place of intended operation between
24 and 48 hours prior to beginning the operation and the manager of any airport whose landing area or runway is within
5 miles of the model rocket launch site.

Analysis of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking effort by submitting written data, views, or arguments.
All comments received during the comment period were considered before making a determination regarding this final
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period, a total of 117 comments were received in response to Notice 92&hyph;12. Two comments were
received from the NAR, and one comment each, from the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), the Arizona Pilots Association,
the Airport Transport Association (ATA), and the National Fire Protection Association. Ninety-one comments were
received from individuals, eight from pilots, six from model rocket associations, three from teachers/professional
educators, and one each from a scientist, an aerospace educational organization, and a model rocket manufacturer.
A discussion of these comments follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the NPRM as written. All other commenters oppose the NPRM and support, instead, either the
original NAR petition or the development of regulatory action which proposes fewer model rocket notification requirements.
Comments opposing the NPRM are summarized in the following categories, each of which is subsequently discussed more
fully:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Approximately 95 commenters state there is no need for a separate category of ``Large Model Rockets''; they favor
adoption of NAR's original petition for rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Approximately 74 commenters believe the NPRM's proposed notification requirements are burdensome and unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Approximately 8 commenters state the FAA needs to update its rules to reflect the current technology of model rocketry
and to promote the inherent educational value of the hobby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Approximately 3 commenters oppose both the NPRM and NAR's original petition for rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Approximately 4 commenters suggest regulatory alternatives to the NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters oppose the proposal to establish a separate category of ``Large Model Rockets'' and instead
support the NAR's original petition to broaden the exempt definition of model rockets. Based upon NAR and FAA studies,
commenters argue that air traffic will not be adversely affected by the NAR's requested increase in the maximum, unregulated
model rocket liftoff and propellant weight. The NAR reiterates that, ``not a single documented incident of model
rockets interfering with aviation, hitting or harming aircraft on ascent or descent of the rocket, or impairing aircraft
flight operations has occurred''. Commenters attribute this enviable safety record to rocketeers' voluntary compliance
with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model Rocket Safety Code.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, they consider the code and a rocketeer's own visual and aural check as sufficient launch safety measures.
Moreover, several commenters assert that increasing model rocket weight may actually improve model rocket safety
as heavier rockets are purported to have larger drag coefficients, achieve lower altitudes, have shorter flight
duration, and be more easily seen by aircraft than lighter rockets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees that the model rocket industry has a long and distinguished record of safety. However, as noted in Notice
92&hyph;12, the FAA must acknowledge the remote, yet inherent increase in hazard potential that accompanies greater
model rocket propellant/mass weight. This consideration is particularly relevant for general aviation aircraft
and rotorcraft, which operate at a lower velocity and flight altitude, making them especially vulnerable to collision
with larger, more powerful model rockets. In order to provide a maximum level of safety protection to aircraft passengers
and crew members, the FAA has determined that operational safeguards, beyond the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model Rocket Safety Code
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and rocketeers' own diligence, are needed for larger rockets with greater propellant/mass weight. Therefore, a
regulatory category that segregates larger rockets from smaller rockets is required.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters believe that the proposed notification requirements for ``Large Model Rocket'' launches
are unnecessary and burdensome. Commenters argue that the FAA has cited ``no cases where notification would have
increased air safety above and beyond .&blank;.&blank;. current regulations which require no notification.''
Several commenters also mention the potential for conflict to occur between lawful rocketeers and airport/ATC officials
who are unfamiliar with model rocketry and with 14 CFR Part 101 entitlement. Two commenters detail occasions where
misinformation was believed to have resulted in the denial of waiver applications or the interruption of model rocket
launch competitions. Commenters are equally troubled by the requirement to notify air traffic officials within
24 to 48 hours of ``Large Model Rocket'' launches, regardless of where these launches occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed notification requirements assist the FAA and airport officials in determining how model rocket launch
activities may affect flight operations in a given area. The proposed requirements are not intended to hinder or minimize
model rocket activity, but merely to ensure that airspace is mutually accommodating of both model rocket operations
and aircraft operations. To this end, FAA or airport officials review model rocket launch information and make it
available to pilots, as necessary, via air traffic control or through Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) publications. NOTAMs
highlight events that may result in airspace restrictions and give time frames in which restrictions will be in effect.
Review of NOTAMs offers pilots an opportunity to adjust or reschedule their flight plans in light of planned aerial
activity. Because a pilot's awareness of model rocket launches enhances this safety process, the proposed notification
requirements are beneficial. Additionally, to facilitate disclosure of requested model rocket launch data, the
NPRM proposed a decrease in the amount and specificity of information currently required from rocketeers. For example,
when there are multiple participants at a single event, rather than give names and addresses for every rocketeer,
a single person may be designated as the event launch coordinator for the operation. Similarly, rather than provide
the specific number, size, weight, and maximum altitude of each rocket to be launched, the appropriate individual
may estimate the information. The FAA further concludes that the current level of safety will not be decreased by utilizing
the less restrictive reporting requirements as proposed in the NPRM when a single name and address of the person provided
is that of the event launch coordinator, and this person is the one who has provided the other required launch data estimates
for that event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommend that notification of the airport manager or FAA tower facility be required only when
large model rockets will be launched into controlled airspace or within 5 miles of an airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current prohibition against operating such model rockets in controlled airspace, within 5 miles of an airport,
within 1,500 feet of any non-participant, or between sunset and sunrise, will not apply provided the person operating
the model rocket complies with the proposed modified provisions of &sect;101.25. The intent of the notice requirement
is not to exclude or hinder model rocket operations, but to provide notification of such operations to afford an adequate
level of safety for person and property in the air, as well as on the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters maintain that the notice requirement is unrealistic for several reasons: Model rocket launch times are
inherently unpredictable as they are dependent upon favorable cloud cover and weather conditions; many impromptu
launches occur at model rocket meets, making it difficult to give prior disclosure of the total number of participants
and other launch information; the notification process may prove too complex for novice or youthful rocketeers;
and, the notification process is likely to be cost intensive to the FAA, as the agency will be forced to process a presumably
high number of waiver applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA disagrees that the notification process may prove too complex for novice or youthful rocketeers. Through
voluntary compliance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model Rocket Safety Code,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 model rocketeers of all ages have proven a ready aptitude and willingness for ensuring launch safety and have demonstrated
an awareness of how to knowledgeably operate scientific equipment. The effective handling of these important responsibilities
is believed to be an accurate indicator of rocketeers' ability to adhere to the proposed notification requirements.
The FAA acknowledges that the agency will incur costs in receiving, recording, and evaluating notification information;
but, the agency determines these costs to be minor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believe the FAA needs to update 14 CFR Part 101 to reflect the current technology of model rocketry
and to promote the inherent educational value of the hobby. According to the NAR, original model rocket limitations
were set in light of what was the only foreseeable type of model rocket propellant at the time, black powder. Over the
years, new propellant technologies have emerged that are vastly superior to black powder, both in terms of specific
impulse and a capability to accommodate more complex payloads, e.g. cameras, radio control receivers, and computer
equipment. One commenter mentions that it is difficult to construct these payloads while remaining within the present
16 ounce total weight limitation. Most commenters agree that the more diverse payloads available with larger-sized
rockets present unique opportunities for promoting scientific study. Teachers and rocketry clubs report using
larger rockets as educational aids. Science professionals use them in collecting data and conducting analysis.
These groups believe their efforts help the United States remain academically and technologically competitive.
As such, they assert that the FAA's proposed restrictions on large model rockets are counterproductive to scientific
achievement and overall growth of the model rocket industry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three major factors form the basis of the proposed amendment: (1) The FAA's support in fostering public interest in
aeronautics through model rocketry; (2) the agency's recognition of the importance for model rocketeers to utilize
state-of-the-art technology to enhance educational value and international competitiveness; and (3) the agency's
responsibility to ensure aircraft flight safety. Accordingly, the proposed amendment reflects the FAA's desire
to support the advancement of model rocketry while maintaining an assurance that larger and faster rockets do not
jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters oppose both the NPRM and NAR's original petition. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and the
Air Transport Association (ATA) believe that the larger and more powerful rockets pose a potential threat to air traffic
safety. Both organizations underscore the point that larger model rockets are capable of achieving aircraft cruising
altitudes. In this regard, ALPA believes collision with a model rocket can cause aircraft damage beyond that ``comparable
to the impact of large hailstones'' and that penetration of the aircraft wing skin is likely. For this reason, ALPA
believes that the current provisions of 14 CFR Part 101 best ensure safety and recommends that the notification requirements
be applied to any rocket firing surpassing 1500 feet above ground level (AGL), regardless of airport proximity. Additionally,
ALPA recommends that a safety officer should visually survey rocket firings in controlled areas and manufacturers
should provide a copy of applicable FAA regulations relating to launch activities. The ATA favors ensuring safety
by permitting no unmanned rockets within a 30-mile radius of regulated airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges a minimal risk increase in hazard potential that accompanies the operation of larger, more powerful
rockets. This minimal risk increase was confirmed by a March 1991 FAA study, Model Rocketry Hazard Study, conducted
as part of the agency's analysis of in-flight collision probability between aircraft and model rockets. In concert
with the study's final report recommendation, Notice 92&hyph;12 proposed certain guidelines for large model rocket
launches. These proposed guidelines, together with rocketeers' proven launch safety vigilance, effectively lessen
the minimal risk increase in hazard potential associated with heavier model rockets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter concurs with the safety concerns raised by ATA and ALPA and alleges that hazardous incidents have occurred
with larger model rockets. This commenter believes that present technology offers model rockets sufficient propellant
capacity so that the FAA should set a maximum allowable rocket weight of 3 pounds and hold propellant mass to a maximum
62.5 grams. To further ensure safety, this commenter recommends that the FAA establish clear, defined limits for
model rocket construction material. The commenter contends that ``hi-tech'' paper and plastic are being used to
construct more durable rockets than 14 CFR 101 intends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No data was provided by the commenter to support the allegation, and the FAA has no other data which substantiates any
occurrence of hazardous instances with larger model rockets. The FAA shares the viewpoint that model rockets only
be constructed of paper and other breakable material. To reiterate this agency intent, Notice 92&hyph;12 maintains
the current language of &sect;101.1(c), which outlines appropriate material for model rocket construction. However,
to issue explicit direction on the manufacture of model rockets, which appears to be the commenter's suggestion,
goes beyond the FAA's regulatory purview.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the FAA create a uniform set of regulations pertaining specifically to model rockets
weighing greater than 53 ounces launch weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges the commenters' suggestions and concerns. However, since Notice 92&hyph;12 conveyed only
those proposals contained in the original NAR petition. Recommendations to create an additional set of uniform rules
specifically for model rockets would be a separate rulemaking action and is beyond the scope of this particular action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAR and several other commenters assert that an apparent typographical error in Notice 92&hyph;12 incorrectly
reports the NAR's estimate of model rocket launches as 250,000 since the inception of the sport. Commenters state
that the appropriate number, as submitted in NAR's 1985 study, is 250,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has investigated the commenters' assertion and noted that Notice 92&hyph;12 reference was ``250,000 launches
of model rockets since the inception of the sport .&blank;.&blank;.'' The estimate, as contained in the NAR report
is, ``At the time the NAR's petition was submitted in 1985, NAR informed the FAA that more than 250,000,000 launches
had been made.'' Because the number of launches of model rockets since the inception of the sport was not used in any
FAA rulemaking calculations, the correct figure is hereby noted in this document and has no further bearing on this
rulemaking activity.

Cost-Benefit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'', as defined by Executive Order
12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this final rule are summarized
below. (A detailed discussion of costs and benefits is contained in the full evaluation in the docket for this final
rule).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule for unmanned rockets consists of provisions that specify what persons operating certain model rockets
(rockets using not more than 125 grams of propellant; made of paper, wood, or breakable plastic; containing no substantial
metal parts, and weighing not more than 1500 grams including propellant) would be required to do. The final rule is
designed to accommodate the advancement of model rocketry with regulations that will also provide an adequate level
of assurance that such rockets will not jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that the changes in the final rule will have a no cost impact to users of model rockets. In fact, the
changes might produce a cost savings. The savings associated with these changes, however are considered negligible
and unquantifiable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101.22(a)(2), however, may impose minor costs on the FAA. Persons operating model rockets will have to provide
the information required in existing &sect;101.25 to the manager of that airport and to the FAA ATC facility that is
nearest the place of the intended operation. The FAA would then incur costs associated with receiving, recording,
and evaluating the material that has been received. The FAA believes that these costs will be minor.

Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule will provide benefits, in that the FAA has determined that the final regulations will accommodate the
advancement of model rocketry and simultaneously provide an adequate level of assurance that such rockets will not
jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight.

Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the fact that there are little or no compliance costs coupled with the potential benefits, the FAA concludes
that the final rule is cost beneficial.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have
``a significant cost impact on a substantial number of small entities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regards to this regulatory evaluation, there is no cost associated with any of the amendments. The FAA has determined
that the amendments contained herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

International Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments apply to users of model rockets in the United States only. There is no economic impact resulting from
any of the amendments and the FAA has determined that these regulations will not have an impact on international trade.

Federalism Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. This rule is not considered significant under DOT Order 2100.5,
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). In addition, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have
a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A regulatory evaluation of the final rule, including a Regulatory Flexibility
Determination and Trade Impact Assessment, has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending July 21 for early-season proposals and
September 2 for late-season proposals. The deadline for late-season proposals was subsequently extended to September
9 in the September 7

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 46320). These regulations would be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae
(ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae (doves and pigeons), Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens,
and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock and snipe). These species are designated as ``migratory game birds''
in conventions between the United States and several foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds.
All other birds designated as migratory (under 10.13 of Subpart B of 50 CFR Part 10) in the aforementioned conventions
may not be hunted. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided
supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. On June 23, 1994,
a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, an announced in the April 7 and June 8

, to review the status of waterfowl. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these late seasons. On August
17, 1994, the Service published a fourth document (59 FR 42474) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird
hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands
selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95. The fifth document in the series,
published August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43684), dealt specifically with proposed frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 late-season
migratory bird hunting regulations. On September 1, 1994, the Service published in the

 consisting of final late-season frameworks for migratory game bird hunting regulations, from which State wildlife
conservation agency officials selected late-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95.
The final rule described here is the ninth in a series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents for
migratory game bird hunting regulations and deals specifically with amending subpart K of CFR part 20 to set hunting
seasons, hours, areas, and limits for species subject to late-season regulations and those for early seasons that
were previously deferred.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement:
Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88&hyph;14),'' filed with
EPA on June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). However,
this programmatic document does not prescribe year-specific regulations; those are developed annually. The annual
regulations and options are being considered in the Environmental Assessment, ``Waterfowl Hunting Regulations
for 1994,'' which is available upon request.

Endangered Species Act Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In August 1994, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical
habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between
seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their
habitats. The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation under section 7 are considered public
documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird
Management.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes minimum standards for real estate appraisals made by staff, fee panel and contract appraisers
in determining the maximum insurable mortgage amount in most HUD/FHA single family (one-to-four family) and multifamily
transactions; and establishes criteria for the selection of appraisers by mortgagees. The rule also distinguishes
those appraisals that may be performed by state licensed appraisers from those that must be performed by state certified
appraisers.

II. Publication of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 16, 1993, the Department published in the above Docket, at 58 FR 48556, a proposed rule entitled ``Appraisals
and Property Valuation''. The proposal, among other things, would promulgate a new part 267 to title 24 of the Code
of Federal Regulations containing minimum standards for HUD real estate appraisals and criteria for the selection
of appraisers by mortgagees. The preamble to the proposed rule describes, in greater detail than below, the legislative
background for this rulemaking and set the rulemaking in the context of certain administrative changes that the Department
had been considering on its own initiative. The preamble also explains the significant provisions of proposed part
267 as well as certain conforming amendments to other parts of HUD regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule implements two statutory provisions. Section 142 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (Reform Act) requires that the appraisal of all property securing an FHA-insured mortgage be performed
in accordance with generally approved appraisal standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 322 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Cranston-Gonzalez) provides that single
family Direct Endorsement (DE) mortgagees may choose the appraisers who evaluate properties securing FHA-insured
mortgages and states that those appraisers may be legal entities as well as natural persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Furthermore, as explained in the proposed rule, HUD, on its own initiative, has been revising its procedures for qualifying
appraisers and for requiring their use in various FHA programs. The objective is to identify under each program the
particular method of determining who is qualified to perform the appraisal, consultancy or other type of evaluation,
based on differences inherent in the broad range of insurance programs that comprise Titles I and II of the National
Housing Act (Act, NHA).

As a consequence of the Congressional mandates and its own initiatives, the Department published the proposed rule
which elicited 384 written public comments. Some of these comments raised a single issue, while others expressed
multiple questions or concerns. Many were repetitive. In this rule, a number of changes are the direct consequence
of, or are easily traceable to, public comments, as explained below. Also being adopted are changes originated by
the Department as a result of having further considered its proposal. Mainly, these modifications are designed to
simplify the rule in its final form and to address comments which objected to the burdensomeness of several proposed
requirements. In addition, there are a number of editorial revisions that were needed to correct errors and improve
readability; they are self-explanatory and are not discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Differences Between the Proposed and Final Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule differs from the proposal in two general respects. The first difference is in response to a view expressed
by several commenters that the proposed rule was difficult to follow and should be split into separate rules covering
single family and multifamily programs, respectively. HUD does not believe that such radical restructuring is necessary
but does recognize that FHA's single and multifamily programs differ enough that a division of the proposed rule's
content along those lines would be helpful. Consequently, the final rule has reorganized the new part 267 into three
subparts. Subpart A includes material common to both single and multifamily programs, subpart B relates exclusively
to single family programs and subpart C relates only to multifamily programs. This revision has necessitated a technical,
non-substantive redrafting of various proposed sections, e.g., the definition of ``appraisal'' has been tailored
to fit subparts B and C, but these changes do not affect meaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not as obvious is a shift in the final rule toward a less incursive regulatory posture that gives greater recognition
to accepted industry standards and practices. Several HUD standards contained in the proposal are being deleted
and the Departure Provision of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) is being acknowledged
with respect to single family programs. Regarding this latter change, FHA currently requires that all single family
appraisals be ``complete appraisals'', as that term is defined under Standard 1 of USPAP, but instances may arise
when the Departure Provision will be invoked to authorize ``limited appraisals'' under specific circumstances
and on a case-by-case basis. In general, we are increasingly convinced that, with legislative prompting, the appraisal
profession is moving in the direction of effective self-regulation and that HUD should limit its role to adapting
industry requirements and practices to particular FHA needs rather than competing with broader ongoing efforts
to improve the reliability of residential appraisals and the overall performance of the appraisal industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Set forth below is a discussion of significant changes from the proposed rule contained in each of the three subparts
of new part 267. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A_General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;267.1 (applicability), paragraph (b)(2) has been changed to add a reference to &sect;201.23(b)(3) regarding
the ``trade-in'' of a borrower's equity in a manufactured home. As a result, part 267 now excludes appraisals used
in determining the borrower's equity in an existing manufactured home traded for a new manufactured home to be purchased
with a Title I loan. This reference was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule. Also, in paragraph (b)(3) of
&sect;267.1, the exception for property improvement loans has been broadened by changing the phrase ``one- to-four
family dwellings'' to ``property'' since the exception should cover Title I commercial and multifamily property
improvement loans as well as one-to-four family dwellings. The paragraph has also been revised to reflect a recent
decision by the Department to enhance the Title I program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``FIRREA'' (Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act 1989) has been included
as definition (d) under &sect;267.2 to aid the reader. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A broad description of ``Single family program'' has been included as definition (j) under &sect;267.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``USPAP'' has been included as definition (l) under &sect;267.2 and to it has been added the provision of former &sect;267.4(c)(4).
That provision states the Department's policy of recognizing any changes or additions to USPAP which the Appraisal
Standards Board may from time to time adopt, unless HUD publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its decision not to recognize a change or addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;267.3, paragraph (b)(1) [formerly &sect;267.6(b)(1)] prohibits certain discriminatory acts. It has
been extensively revised in response to numerous comments about the burdensomeness for mortgagees of reporting
on the relative frequency with which they use women and minority status appraisers. At the same time, we have been careful
to ensure the public availability of the data which would have been provided by those reports and which for single family
programs the Department will now obtain elsewhere in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;267.3. The Department
will be scrutinizing that data carefully. We will not countenance discrimination by lenders against female and minority
status appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For single family programs, HUD will compile an annual report directly from information which the Department will
maintain for each appraiser listed on the Roster. Information with respect to gender and minority status will be furnished
by the appraiser at the time he or she applies for listing. This is permitted by the newly-added reference to ``such
further information as HUD may require'' in &sect;267.8(d)(2). When the mortgagee accesses the Computerized Homes
Underwriting Management System (CHUMS), giving the appraiser's certification or license number, the information
on the appraiser will be recorded from the Roster data bank. For fee panel appraisers, HUD will record the information
from the Roster data at the time the panelist is assigned. The Department will be able to prepare the annual report directly
from this information and will make it available to members of the public upon request. See &sect;267.3(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to multifamily programs, there do not exist systems analogous to CHUMS and the Roster, and consequently
the data must be furnished by Delegated Processors, contract appraisers and consultants, and each housing finance
agency (HFA) participating in the Department's HFA Risk-Sharing Program. Since the number of multifamily cases
processed is considerably less than single family activity during a given time span, this burden should not be unreasonable.
Details of this reporting requirement will be specified in one of the terms of the contract/agreements which HUD executes
with its Delegated Processors, contract appraisers and consultants and HFAs. Because reporting under multifamily
programs is being implemented by contractural obligation, and because that obligation is not set forth under existing
contracts, the data will not become immediately available when this rule takes effect. As of the effective date provided
at the beginning of this preamble, however, all new contractural agreements and all renewals or renegotiations of
existing agreements will provide for the data to be furnished thereafter. See &sect;267.3(c)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;267.6(c) relating to competency is now paragraph &sect;267.3(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;267.4, entitled `` waiver'', has been added at the end of subpart A. The section authorizes the Assistant
Secretary-Commissioner to waive any requirement in part 267 not mandated by statute when enforcement of that requirement
would adversely affect the purposes of the NHA. It is unlikely that this waiver authority would be invoked often under
part 267. However, HUD has been including a similar waiver provision in many recently adopted rules because it does
permit administrative flexibility in unusual circumstances when invariable application of a rule would be unfair
or contrary to program objectives.

Subpart B_Single Family Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;267.5, entitled ``Definitions applicable to single family programs'', paragraph (a), defining ``Appraisal'',
no longer includes the phrase ``as estimated by HUD staff or an appraiser under contract with HUD'' which appeared
in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.2(b)(2). The effect of this change is that the DE lender, not HUD, will be responsible for estimating replacement
cost under the section 220 single family program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In customary usage, the term ``single family'' is well established. However, there are FHA programs that do not fit
the usual concept of one-to-four family dwellings, yet are governed by one-to-four family appraisal standards and
procedures, specifically, Title I multifamily and non-residential property improvement loans. The revised definition
(c) under &sect;267.5, ``one-to-four family residential property'', covers this anomaly. Note that there is no
parallel definition of multifamily programs, which simply include all other FHA mortgage origination transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.6 follows proposed &sect;267.3, but with minor editing to improve readability and clarity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 267.7, Appraisal standards, represents an extensive revision of proposed &sect;267.4 on this subject.
Specifically: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed rule stated that the USPAP Departure Provision would not apply to FHA single family appraisals. The
preamble to the proposed rule stated a concern that the Provision might be used to dispense with important information
gathering. (See 58 FR 48560). After considering the matter more fully, we have decided that this concern is unjustified.
Each of the appraisal forms permitted by HUD makes clear what information is required and any deficiency should be
readily noticed by the review appraiser or underwriter. Also, the Provision will only be invoked under unusual circumstances,
subject to mutual agreement of the mortgagee and appraiser, after obtaining consent from the local HUD office. Should
appropriate circumstances arise and a complete appraisal not be required, the Provision gives HUD the administrative
flexibility to save the parties needless expense. The Department expects that eventually, as experience is gained,
a handbook addition or other directive will be issued with respect to Departure situations in single family programs.
In view of the foregoing, the Provision is being given recognition for single family programs and reference to it (as
being inapplicable) has been dropped from former &sect;267.4(a)(1), now &sect;267.7(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 267.4(a)(3) of the proposed rule is being deleted as unnecessary and somewhat redundant since &sect;267.7(a)(8)
of the final rule covers the question of property valuation methods in greater detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 267.4(a)(4)(i) of the proposed rule described the appraisal report forms. That section has been revised
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.7(a) of the final rule to extract the language pertinent to single family programs. Two Federal National
Mortgage Association forms are also being added as acceptable for FHA single family purposes; these are somewhat
more detailed than the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report and offer an alternative means of presenting the data.
In addition, former &sect;267.4(a)(4)(iii) required sufficient ``depth of analysis'' to reflect the complexity
of the property. HUD has concluded that the data necessary for an appraisal which satisfies the other FHA standards
will necessarily reveal whether the property is complex so as to require a certified rather than a licensed appraiser.
Therefore, the need for this separate and rather vague standard is avoided and the language of proposed &sect;267.4(a)(4)(iii)
has been dropped from this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Proposed &sect;267.4(a)(7) is being deleted as not really pertinent for single family programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Proposed &sect;267.4(a)(11) is being deleted to simplify the appraiser's responsibilities. We agree with several
commenters that the added burden of requiring the appraiser to check the property's legal description is not justified
by the remote likelihood of a mistake in the address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section 267.7(a)(8) still requires the appraiser to certify that the racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhood
has in no way affected the appraisal determination. However, the phrase ``or socioeconomic'' has been dropped as
part of this certification. The term was not susceptible to a clear understanding. It was, in fact, misleading, since
the economic composition of the surrounding neighborhood, e.g., level of property maintenance, is a valid consideration
in determining value, whereas any consideration of the social mix and demographics is precluded by the rule's explicit
warning that the appraiser must not give weight to racial and ethnic aspects of the neighborhood
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

In addition to the certification requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.7(a)(8) it should also be noted that the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report Form states in bold type
that ``[r]ace and the racial composition of the neighborhood are not appraisal factors.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Proposed &sect;267.4(a)(12), now &sect;267.7(a)(9), describing valuation methods, has been revised to extract
the relevant single family provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.8(a)(1)(i)(A) of the rule contains a parenthetical phrase to make clear that a mortgagee selecting an
appraisal organization may also select a particular employee within that organization to perform the appraisal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 267.8(c)(1) embodies the prohibitions of proposed &sect;267.5(c), but has been simplified in one respect.
Proposed &sect;267.5(c)(1) addressed contracts between the mortgagee and the appraiser if the two were affiliated.
While this relationship is still prohibited in multifamily cases, in single family programs, where DE mortgagees
may employ staff appraisers, it is inconsistent with much of the lending industry's practice. The prohibition has
therefore been dropped from &sect;267.8(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;267.8(d)(1), the list of legal entities which, together with natural persons, comprise eligible types
of appraisers has been expanded from the list in &sect;267.5(d)(1) of the proposed rule to include joint ventures,
limited liability companies and other organizations. In addition, &sect;267.8(d)(1) has been redrafted to explain
the options available to a DE mortgagee in need of an appraiser, i.e., an independent contractor, a staff employee
or a fee panelist. Section 267.5(d)(1) of the proposed rule did not cover these options; paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)
and (d)(1)(iii) focused instead on appraiser qualifications, which made them somewhat redundant since appraiser
qualifications were also set forth in &sect;267.5(d)(2), now &sect;267.8(d)(2), describing the Roster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;267.5(d)(1)(iv) has been incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.8 (d)(1) of this rule and revised to make it clear that the mortgagee and appraiser share not only concurrent
but also equal responsibility for the accuracy and thoroughness of an appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;267.8(d)(2), the appraiser, rather than providing evidence of compliance with the items listed in proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.5(d) (2)(i)&hyph;(vi), may now certify that he or she satisfies the requirements of that paragraph. Also,
two of the proposed requirements have been dropped: there is no obligation to obtain errors and omissions insurance
unless the mortgagee requires it and there is no fee for being listed on the Roster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.8(f)(1) [proposed &sect;267.5(h)] no longer requires as a condition to transferring an appraisal that
the accepting mortgagee have ``adopted appraisal review procedures in accordance with this part''. Inclusion of
this condition in the proposed rule was an error. There is no appraisal review procedure contained in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.5(f) of the proposed rule, regarding the extent to which others may assist the appraiser, has been deleted.
As explained above, the thrust of many changes which distinguish this rule from the proposal is to place a greater reliance
on USPAP and, wherever possible, to achieve compatibility with generally accepted practices of the appraisal industry.
Consistent with this approach, the Department looks to USPAP to set criteria for the ``assistance of others''.

Finally, mention should be made of the conforming amendment under 24 CFR part 204, Coinsurance, contained in the proposed
rule (58 FR 48566). On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14809, Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1717), the Department proposed termination
of its single family coinsurance program but the proceeding in Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1717 is still open. Until
final action is taken, part 204 remains in effect and is being amended by this rule.

Section 267.9, Definitions applicable to multifamily programs, extracts from &sect;267.2 of the proposed rule
those definitions pertinent to multifamily programs. As with &sect;267.5, some editorial changes have been required
to accommodate this separation of the definitions from the format in which they were proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.10, Qualified appraisers and appraisals, derives from &sect;267.3 of the proposal. It has been redrafted
to fit exclusively multifamily programs. Note also that paragraph (a) provides for HUD employees performing multifamily
appraisals to be qualified as certified general appraisers not later than December 31, 1996, unless the Assistant
Secretary-Commissioner specifies otherwise in an individual case. It is FHA's goal to qualify its staff appraisers
in accordance with the standards of a state as soon as possible. However, the Department is currently undertaking
an extensive reorganization and restructuring of its field office functions and jurisdictions. Very likely, a number
of HUD Multifamily appraisers, including some who have already attained certified general status, will be retiring
in the near future. Time is required to recoup such losses and our current estimate is that we will not be able to achieve
comprehensive certification of multifamily appraisers until the end of 1996. Some currently certified employees
will remain, of course, and others will become certified before that time, but we cannot set a precise schedule because
available training funds for the 1995 and 1996 fiscal years are not known nor is the retirement rate predictable with
much accuracy. Moreover, the dispatch with which HUD can accomplish conprehensive certification of its staff appraisers
will be directly proportional to the extent of training and experience required by different states so progress will
undoubtedly vary from one field office to another. We have set a date of December 31, 1996 for achieving full staff certification
in multifamily programs; however, in the event funding and attrition rates differ appreciably from our projections,
we will adjust the effective date to make it earlier if possible, later if necessary.

As is the case with &sect;267.7, which sets standards for single family appraisals, &sect;267.11 has been extensively
revised both to reduce requirements and to extract specific_in this case multifamily_appraisal standards. In most
respects, &sect;&sect;267.7 and 267.11 are alike, except that in &sect;267.11: 1) the prescribed appraisal forms
are different; 2) the review of historical sales prices covers a three-year (or more), rather than a one-year, time
span; 3) proposed rule paragraphs 267.4(a)(7) and (a)(8), concerning marketing period and factors that affect income
and the absorption period, are relevant for multifamily sales and are included; and 4) the reference to valuation
methods focuses on the greater concern with replacement cost in multifamily programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons cited above in the description of &sect;267.8, the provision regarding the assistance of others,
&sect;267.5(f) of the proposed rule, has been deleted. However, &sect;267.12 contains a new paragraph (b)(2), inadvertently
omitted from the proposed rule, that outlines the relationship between an appraiser and a Delegated Processor. Paragraph
(b)(2) explains that HUD must review and approve each appraiser who works for a Delegated Processor, either as an employee
or as an independent contractor. We also review and approve each appraiser employed under a Technical Discipline
Contract (TDC).

The Two Main Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the comments addressed one or both of the principal objectives of the rule: to require the certification or
licensing of appraisers for FHA-insured mortgages and to enable DE mortgagees to use appraisers of their own choosing
for FHA transactions.

The Certification/Licensure Issue
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was pointed out in the proposed rule, the requirement that FHA appraisers must be certified or licensed, depending
upon the nature of the transaction, is based on section 142 of the Reform Act, and parallels a similar Congressional
mandate in FIRREA that only certified general, certified residential or licensed persons may perform appraisals
involving federally related transactions. Thus, when section 142 was enacted, a system of state certification and
licensing was already under development. This was beneficial in two respects. First, it obviated the need for HUD
to develop its own regulatory structure with a resultant drain on staff and budgetary resources. Second, by drawing
upon the FIRREA system as an established resource, HUD could fulfill its regulatory responsibility with a minimum
of added expense to homebuyers. We believe that most appraisers will soon be certified and/or licensed in order to
participate in the broad range of federally related transactions and also to enhance their own professional stature.
The cost of added training and membership will then be distributed over a wide base of consumers. Moreover, there will
probably be a dwindling pool of unlicensed and uncertified appraisers upon which mortgagees can draw so that, quite
apart from the mandate of section 142, debate over the need for such accreditation in FHA programs will become academic.
In any event, HUD retains its control over appraisal fees permitted for single family programs to make sure that they
do not rise disproportionately.

The Appraiser Selection Issue
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the DE mortgagee's right to choose appraisers, we specifically requested comment from the public.
It is not possible for HUD to preclude that choice by rulemaking, since the mortgagee's right to choose has been mandated
by Congress and is therefore beyond the scope of agency policy. However, we wanted to assess the extent and weight of
public opinion in order to ascertain if there were a good case HUD might present to Congress for repealing the provision.
We found that public opinion was fairly well balanced between support and opposition. Some commenters argued that
lender choice would lead to abuse and distorted valuation; others that it would do no more than serve to simplify and
speed the appraisal process. We turned, therefore, to an analogy with experience already gained, inferring that
use of the staff appraisers employed by many major lending firms should have the same potential for abuse and the same
tendency to encourage lender-dictated property values. Yet increasing experience with this practice has not indicated
that the accuracy or thoroughness of lender staff appraisals has been compromised by pressure on the employee. We
have concluded that serious concern about the integrity of lender-selected appraisers is not supported by current
evidence and we do not plan to pursue the matter legislatively at this time.

Comment on review appraisers: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has not adequately addressed the need for qualifying review appraisers. Furthermore, there is no
recognition of the difference between a technical review and an administrative review as those terms are understood
within the appraisal industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has given considerable thought to the general question of appraisal reviews and who performs them. For FHA purposes,
reviews are essentially of two types. First are those incidental to the duties of the DE underwriter. In these instances,
the appraisal is accepted on its face, while certain factors are weighed into the decision of whether or not to underwrite,
and if so, whether to change the loan amount on the basis of an adjustment to value. This is not an appraisal action; it
is an underwriting judgment as we explained in the proposed rule. Along with these judgments, the underwriter exercises
administrative review responsibilities, checking to see if the appraiser has properly completed the form, noting
the comparables used, etc. We see no element of technical review in this role of the underwriter, who is not certified
or licensed in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type of review is technical, as compared to administrative. With respect to multifamily transactions,
technical reviews are conducted by HUD staff or by a contractor and may result in a revision of the appraisal report.
In the case of single family transactions, they are conducted by HUD staff and may provide a basis for administrative
sanctions, but they do not materially affect the appraisal report. Whether a technical review is performed by a contractor
or by HUD staff, the reviewer must be certified in the case of multifamily programs and either certified or licensed,
as is necessary, for single family programs. In order to make HUD's own internal practices consistent with the standard
that we apply to private sector appraisers, the Department intends that over the next several years, every FHA multifamily
and single family staff appraiser who performs reviews will become either certified or licensed, whichever is appropriate
for the nature of the reviews that he or she performs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on loan correspondents choosing appraisers: The proposed rule does not clarify whether loan correspondents
or their sponsors should choose the appraiser.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department expects sponsors to be responsible for underwriting single family loans submitted by their loan correspondents.
Consistent with this approach, the sponsor must select the appraiser.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment on limiting market value with replacement cost: It is ill-advised and inconsistent with USPAP for HUD to stipulate
that market value shall not exceed replacement cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees with several of the commenters that there are instances when replacement cost does not keep
step with market value, and this is precisely why a limitation is needed. We do not agree that a property can adequately
secure a debt for any sum greater than is sufficient to replace the property. For purposes of mortgage financing, value
must be ascertained prudently. It is not the same, for example, as the value assigned to property when setting a market
price. For FHA purposes, it is fair and sensible to limit market value by replacement cost, particularly since it will
be supported by an actual construction contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are puzzled by the assertion of one commenter that HUD's policy is inconsistent with USPAP. Standards Rule 1&hyph;5
of USPAP states that the appraiser must consider and reconcile the quality and quantity of data available and analyzed
within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches used and the applicability or suitability of those approaches which are set forth in Standards Rule 1&hyph;4.
For FHA, the acceptable approach is market value, although replacement cost is recognized as a limit to data acquired
from the sales of comparable properties. We see no conflict with USPAP in this regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on reporting market conditions and trends: Why require the appraiser to analyze and report on current market
conditions and trends if, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, such conditions and trends should not be factored
into the estimate of value?

of value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This statement failed to make a basic distinction between what is meant by ``trend'' in multifamily compared with
single family programs, and caused several commenters to question the usefulness of trending in single family appraisal
work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A multifamily appraiser must give consideration to long-term projections of market changes in order to estimate,
for example, project income from rents over the life of the mortgage. Trends are therefore of twofold significance
in multifamily cases: they address projected changes in both the intrinsic value of the property and in its earning
ability. Hence, they are essentially forward-looking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By comparison, the existence of rapidly rising or declining prices for single family properties can be ascertained
by analysis of recent sales data. Looking at sale prices within the preceding six months, the appraiser can estimate
the rate of increase or decrease in an area. These rates of change will have an effect on the value of the subject property
and must be taken into consideration.

For both single family and multifamily transactions, however, it should be borne in mind that conditions and trends

Comment on reporting the use of minority appraisers: Reporting on the use of minority and female appraisers is burdensome,
unnecessary and if nevertheless adopted, should be HUD's responsibility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is an important initiative. It is intended to address two matters of concern. One is the perceived underutilization
of minority and female appraisers in general. Second is a perceived underutilization of minority appraisers in communities
where they might be more knowledgeable about trends and conditions and more sensitive to community problems. However,
the Department recognizes the burden this reporting requirement places on mortgagees, especially in FHA's high
volume single family programs. We have therefore revised the requirement so that HUD will accept virtually all responsibility
for compiling and reporting the information for those programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment on differing appraiser classifications: Why does the proposed rule not distinguish between the different
levels of certification, such as a Certified General Appraiser compared with a Certified Residential Appraiser?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do distinguish between certified general and certified residential appraisers in those instances where the distinction
must be made. Thus, when the reference is to multifamily programs, ``certified general'' is intended and the rule
will usually so state. When we are referring to single family programs that require the services of a certified appraiser,
as described in &sect;267.5(b), the rule makes no distinction because either a certified general or a certified residential
appraiser would be appropriate for the assignment. Some jurisdictions have provided for other variant classifications
which this rule does not seek to distinguish. We rely instead on the state accreditation agencies_prompted by the
benefits of reciprocity and guided by the Appraiser Qualifications Board_to maintain comparable standards within
the different classifications for use by FHA, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council members and
other interested agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) and the Farmers Home Administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on continuing the use of DVA certificates of reasonable value (CRVs) and HUD conditional commitments: According
to HUD's Direct Endorsement regulations, in particular 24 CFR 203.5(e): ``In lieu of appraising the property, the
mortgagee may utilize a HUD conditional commitment (for proposed construction only), or a Department of Veterans
Affairs certificate of reasonable value.'' Will this continue to be the practice under the Roster system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Lenders may continue to rely on conditional commitments and CRVs. Part 267 will not affect this interchangeability.
For some time now, both HUD and DVA, by administrative instructions, have required certified or licensed appraisers
for single family appraisals. Moreover, appraisals for veteran housing programs must comply with USPAP. Thus, DVA
and FHA requirements are comparable in key respects and are mutually acceptable. Of course this interchangeability
could end if either agency were to lessen its standards for appraisers or appraisals. We point out also that HUD requires
virtually all applications for mortgage insurance to be processed under the DE program, so very little use is made
of HUD conditional commitments. This fact tends to discourage the mutual recognition of CRVs and conditional commitments
(or at least DVA's recognition of HUD commitments) since 38 U.S.C. 1831 requires that CRV appraisers be assigned on
a rotational basis from a fee panel selected and maintained by DVA_a requirement incompatible with the DE lenders'
freedom to select their appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on the integrity of DE staff appraisers: It is naive and pointless to require that DE lenders separate the appraisal
function from their underwriting operations in order to protect the autonomy and integrity of staff appraisers.
Policy and decisionmaking for every corporate component coalesce at the top of the business structure and filter
downward; a staff appraiser cannot avoid being influenced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are aware of the potential for pressure on staff appraisers, but short of prohibiting the practice altogether,
there is no completely satisfactory solution. We believe that by removing the appraiser from the direct supervision
of the loan production department, two advantages accrue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the appraiser is at least free from the everyday case-by-case control of loan officers. An appraiser may sense
that too many unfavorable appraisals can impede on his or her career track (of course, a self-employed appraiser under
contract with a lender can feel similar pressures), but there will at least not be instances where one's immediate
supervisor looks for a specific value in every case assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, when the nexus of decisionmaking shifts upward, if undue influence is manifest, it is usually easier to fix
accountability. If there is a consistent problem, it will very likely have originated at upper corporate levels.
Top management of a maleficent lending institution will find it more difficult to avoid culpability by claiming that
fraudulent or misleading appraisals are the result of nothing more than faulty supervision or insensitivity to potential
trouble at the loan officer level. Of course none of our precautions, including appraiser independence, can guarantee
that a staff (or contract) appraiser will escape undue pressure. Ultimately, we look to the integrity and long-range
business judgment of the mortgagees themselves to counter serious abuse and destructive practices. As we have observed
previously, there has been a very good overall record on the part of mortgagees and staff appraisers in this regard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on the advisability of the Roster system: The idea of establishing a Roster for single family appraisers appears
to be an offshoot of the fee panel system and is therefore a repudiation of the mortgagee's right to select the appraiser.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Roster and the fee panel are in fact totally different in concept and purpose. The fee panel was initiated as a means
of controlling the quality of appraisers in terms of training, diligence, judgment and professionalism. It functioned
mainly at a time when there was little other assurance in these respects. It afforded a means of training appraisers
in FHA requirements and procedures and it also served to limit the pool of appraisers so that panelists could be kept
active in FHA programs and their experience level would benefit accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstances have now changed completely. First and most importantly, FIRREA has raised and standardized the level
of appraiser competence nationwide so that it is no longer a major concern. Second, the law now permits DE mortgagees
to select appraisers. This means that a system of assigning panelists, unless the mortgagee requests the assignment
or is not DE approved (and most now are) would be illegal_a fact which is overlooked by those commenters who urge HUD
to retain the strict panel assignment system. In a practical sense, it also means that there are far more potential
FHA single family appraisers than this agency, with its increased budget constraints, could hope to train in the manner
that it once did. We must now rely on FIRREA and State accreditation boards to do much of what HUD has done in the past.
The fee panel will continue in a diminished role, and only for those lenders who wish to continue using it. This does
not mean that HUD will abdicate its responsibility for guarding against poor appraisal work. We are instituting the
Roster as a means of monitoring and quickly remedying problems. However, unlike the fee panel system, the Roster will
list any applicant who holds current credentials under state certification/licensing law, who has acquainted himself
or herself with FHA program requirements, and who has a good professional record, including competency in performing
FHA assignments. The Roster will thus provide a rapid means of confirming that the appraiser is in good standing at
the time the mortgagee requests an FHA case number and identifies the appraiser selected. That is its purpose_it is
a monitoring control, not a system for training and qualifying FHA appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on the need to list fee panelists on the Roster: The proposed rule does not clarify whether fee panelists must
be listed on the Roster.

Section 267.8(d)(1) now clarifies that fee panelists must be listed on the HUD Appraiser Roster. Otherwise, minority

Comments on the scope of the Roster: Must an appraiser apply for listing on the Roster in every state where the appraiser

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appraiser must apply to the HUD Office (or to any one of the state's HUD Offices if there are several) in each state
where he or she intends to perform an appraisal. The reason is that every state has its own numbering system and the only
practical means of correlating the Roster data and the record of state accreditation is to maintain a list of all the
various certification and/or license numbers pertaining to that appraiser. Individual employees as well as the
employing institution must be listed since the performance of both will be monitored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on removal from the Roster: If HUD needs to remove an appraiser from the Roster for any reason, it should report
that fact to the state licensing board. Two commenters, in fact, suggested that HUD ``punish'' a disqualified appraiser.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is HUD's intention to report cases of fraudulent or incompetent appraisals and other serious violations of appraisal
professional conduct to state accrediting boards. However, the commenters who favor ``punishment'' mistake the
purpose of the Roster. As we said previously, it is not a device for applying sanctions; it is simply a quality control
measure to assure that appraisers who have not maintained their credentials, or who for some reason have not met FHA
standards, are removed from the system where they can cause a problem. Congress did not make HUD a watchdog or enforcer
for the appraisal industry when it enacted section 142 of the Reform Act, and it would be inappropriate to base a punitive
process on the Roster system. When we discussed the Roster in the Proposed Rule, we explained that 24 CFR part 24 relating
to Government debarment and suspension procedures does not apply to the removal of an appraiser from the listing,
but we also cautioned that the Department will invoke part 24 whenever circumstances call for remedial action and
&sect;267.8(d)(3) so states.

This is a matter that has not been resolved. The Department is exploring several means of helping appraisers who have
not been through fee panel training to become knowledgeable about specific program requirements. We are expediting
this matter and will advise interested members of the public as soon as there is further information. In the meantime,
appraisers should bear in mind that it would be a violation of USPAP's Competency Provision to undertake an assignment
for which the appraiser has not been adequately trained and is not qualified.

organizations, or the number of professional organizations, that an appraiser may choose to join. Our conclusion
in the proposed rule on this point remains unchanged.

Comment on appraising Secretary-held properties: It is short-sighted and ill-advised for HUD to exempt the sale
of Secretary-held properties from part 267. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD disposition properties are indeed exempted from the requirements of part 267, but they are nonetheless subject
to a valuation process in determining what would be an acceptable return on the disposition sale. Moreover, if FHA
mortgage insurance is used to finance that sale, the maximum allowable mortgage is based on the bid amount capped by
the FHA mortgage limit applicable to the area. No appraisal is required, and should the mortgagee on its own initiative
call for one, this part 267 would not apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A Rule Recently Adopted by the Federal Financial Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29482) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision (the Agencies), after publishing
a proposed rule for public comment, amended their respective parts of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding
the appraisal of real property pursuant to FIRREA. These amendments increase from $100,000 to $250,000 the minimum
threshold for residential real estate appraisals as provided by that statute and also broaden existing exemptions
from various other appraisal requirements. In addition, the amendments revise existing provisions with respect
to appraisal content and appraiser independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this final rule, HUD took the Agencies' amendments into consideration. However, we do not believe it
would be appropriate for the Department to adopt a threshold mortgage amount that triggers the need for an appraisal.
HUD is charged with a specific Congressional mandate under section 202(e) of the NHA to assure the quality of each appraisal
used in determining the value of the security for an FHA insured mortgage. The Secretary's accountability in this
regard is more immediate and direct than that of the Agencies in establishing a system of state accreditation under
FIRREA. Moreover, protection of the FHA insurance funds is a duty of the greatest importance to HUD. We do not believe
that we could fulfill these responsibilities by accepting as security for FHA insured mortgages properties that
have not been thoroughly appraised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will therefore require appraisals for single family and multifamily programs as set forth in &sect;267.1,
without exception. Various considerations that underlie the Agencies' other amendments with respect to appraisal
standards, appraiser independence and miscellaneous related matters are, we believe, comprehensively addressed
in this rule. Therefore, specific changes to the Agencies' regulations need not be discussed or included in this rulemaking
which alone governs requirements for FHA mortgage insurance transactions.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The eligibility and performance
requirements contained in this rule are consistent with requirements already established by other government agencies
for lender eligibility. Accordingly, the economic impact of this rule would be minimal, and would affect small and
large entities equally.

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations

The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m.
until 5:30 p.m. in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing

Federalism, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and thus are not subject
to review under the Order. The rule is limited to imposing additional eligibility and performance requirements on
private lenders. The only point of policy contained in part 267 with even an indirect implication for federal-state
relationships is the decision that a HUD appraiser should be subject to the certification requirements of any one
state, but not necessarily other states in which he or she is assigned to perform appraisals. As explained previously,
the standards of various jurisdictions developed pursuant to FIRREA should result in a reasonably uniform level
of competence, and qualifying HUD employees in every jurisdiction would involve many dollars and staff hours spent
on a largely duplicative effort. For purposes of section 142 of the Reform Act, certification by any one state should
therefore be sufficient. In reaching this conclusion, HUD parallels OMB's decision with regard to FIRREA that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For a mortgage insured under Title II of the National Housing Act, the appraiser may be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Employed on the staff of the Direct Endorsement mortgagee or selected by the Direct Endorsement mortgagee (which
includes being selected as an individual from the staff of a selected appraisal organization), provided the appraiser
is listed on the Appraiser Roster provided under this &sect;267.8; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Assigned by HUD from membership on one of its fee panels.

Mortgagees, staff and fee appraisers: conflicts of interests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A mortgagee must avoid conflicts of interest and other relationships which affect, either in reality or in appearance,
the credibility of the appraisal. Accordingly, a mortgagee may not contract with an appraiser or appraisal organization
to perform an appraisal of a property if the builder or seller of the property owns, is owned by, is affiliated with,
or has a financial interest in the appraiser or appraisal organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An appraiser must avoid conflicts of interest and other relationships which affect, either in reality or in appearance,
the credibility of the appraisal. Accordingly, a fee appraiser may not have any interest, direct or indirect, in the
property being appraised. A staff appraiser of a Direct Endorsement mortgagee may not have any direct interest, financial
or otherwise, in the property being appraised, and is permitted an indirect interest only by reason of his or her employment
by a mortgagee that has its appraisal operations isolated from its other activities in accordance with paragraph
(b) of this section.

General rule for Direct Endorsement cases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a mortgage is to be processed by Direct Endorsement, the mortgagee may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Contract with a fee appraiser to perform appraisal services. The contract may be with an individual, a corporation,
a partnership, a sole proprietorship, a joint venture, a limited liability company, or any other legal entity recognized
for the purpose by the state, which the mortgagee has chosen at its sole discretion, provided that the individual appraiser
selected to perform the appraisal is listed on the current HUD Appraiser Roster set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this
section. The mortgagee, concurrently and equally with the appraiser whom it has chosen, accepts full responsibility
for the accuracy, integrity and thoroughness of the appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Use an appraiser employed on its staff, provided that the appraiser is listed on the current HUD Appraiser Roster.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Request HUD to assign an appraiser from one of its fee panels. Fee panelists must be listed on the HUD Appraiser
Roster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD Appraiser Roster. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) HUD will maintain a nationwide listing on an Appraiser Roster of appraisers who are permitted to perform appraisals
in connection with HUD's single family programs. Being listed on the Roster does not indicate a warranty or endorsement
by HUD of any appraiser or appraisal, and &sect;200.145(c) of this chapter applies to each appraisal performed in
accordance with this part. Each applicant for listing or periodic relisting must certify that he or she: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Holds a current certification or license from a state whose qualification standards are in compliance with FIRREA,
as determined by the Appraisal Subcommittee (and must include his or her current certificate or license number);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Has read HUD Handbook 4150.1 and related Mortgagee Letters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not listed on HUD's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Is not debarred, suspended or in any way disqualified from participating in HUD programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In addition, the applicant must submit such additional information as HUD may require. Application to be listed
on the Roster must be made at any HUD Office in each state where the applicant will perform appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Removal from the Roster. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD may at any time remove the appraiser from the Roster for cause. Cause includes, but is not limited to, significant
deficiencies in appraisals, failure to maintain standing as a state certified or state licensed appraiser and prosecution
for committing or attempting to commit fraud, misrepresentation or other offence that may reflect on the appraiser's
character and integrity. Such removal shall not be governed by the procedures of part 24 of this Title. The appraiser
shall, however, be subject to other sanctions in accordance with part 24 of this title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a mortgage is not processed by the Direct Endorsement procedure, the appraiser will be assigned from a fee panel
or otherwise designated by HUD. A mortgagee using the Direct Endorsement procedure may also request HUD to assign
an appraiser from a fee panel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Direct Endorsement lender may accept an appraisal that was prepared by an appraiser engaged directly by another
mortgagee, provided that the appraisal was performed in accordance with this part and that the mortgagee accepting
the appraisal has: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reviewed the appraisal report under its review procedures; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The appraiser or consultant may be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A member of HUD's staff;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Selected by the Delegated Processor in accordance with terms and conditions agreed to in writing by HUD and the
Delegated Processor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Selected to perform appraisals in accordance with the terms and conditions of a formal contract between HUD and
an institution or individual performing the services, or in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Purchase
Order; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD exercises contractual control over the qualifications of those individuals and organizations that perform
appraisal and consultation services in FHA multifamily programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Appraisers and consultants performing services under HUD contracts for Delegated Processing and Technical
Discipline assignments will be selected on the basis of criteria and procedures set forth in the solicitation, pursuant
to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 CFR Chapter I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Under the Delegated Processing Program HUD contracts with a HUD-approved processing company to perform mortgage
insurance underwriting processing and to make a recommendation to HUD. HUD makes the final underwriting determination.
The Delegated Processor must identify the staff or contract review appraiser(s) and consultant(s) and must submit
their qualifications, based upon requirements as set forth in the contract between HUD and the Delegated Processor,
for review and approval. The Delegated Processor may subcontract appraiser and consulting functions, but must identify,
prior to performing the appraisal or consultation, the appraiser or consultant selected under the subcontract and
must provide a resume or qualifications for review and approval by the HUD field office concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Under the Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Program, HUD delegates to state and local housing finance agencies
the authority to originate and service loans that are fully insured by FHA. Under this program, participating agencies
share in the risk associated with monetary losses that may be incurred as a result of loan defaults. An HFA may use either
in-house or contract appraisers who meet certification requirements. The Risk-Sharing Program requires compliance
with USPAP and therefore requires that appraisals be performed by certified general appraisers accredited by the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, requires every agency to promulgate regulations implementing certain
of its provisions. On October 1, 1989, the Office of Government Ethics, formerly part of the Office of Personnel Management,
was established as a separate executive branch agency and is therefore proposing to adopt this rule incorporating
many of its existing practices for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended by the Freedom
of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;570). This rule would also implement the Guidelines for a uniform
Freedom of Information Act fee schedule published by the Office of Management and Budget on March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012)
and the Attorney General's Memorandum on the 1986 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act dated December, 1987.
Subpart G of the rule proposes to establish a separate schedule of fees for the reproduction and mailing of public financial
disclosure reports requested pursuant to section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A of the proposed rule contains general provisions describing the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act
and its coverage. Section 2604.102 describes the types of records to which the Freedom of Information Act applies,
and the relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. The proposed rule also provides that
if another statute, such as the Ethics Act, sets forth procedures for the disclosure of specific types of records,
the Office will process a request for those records in accordance with the procedures that apply to those specific
records. However, in cases where the record is not required to be released under the specific procedures set forth
in another statute, the Office will consider the request under FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2604.102 as proposed also explains that records which are available through an established distribution
system (for example, the National Technical Information Service) should preferably be obtained through that system,
rather than pursuant to the provisions of the FOIA. The terms frequently used in the rule are defined in proposed &sect;2604.104.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Public Reading Room
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart B of the proposed rule describes the location of OGE's public reading room and the materials available there.
The subpart would also set forth the indexing requirements as to any records OGE maintains which are required to be
indexed under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Proposed &sect;2604.202 contains the Director's determination that, because
of OGE's size and the relatively small number of requests for records required to be indexed, such indexes do not need
to be published quarterly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Production and Disclosure of Records Under FOIA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart C as proposed contains detailed rules of procedure for requesting records under FOIA. It also describes the
format to which OGE will adhere in responding to these requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for OGE records have generally been directed to the Office of the General Counsel. Since this approach is
administratively practical, this system is being proposed for codification. Proposed &sect;2604.301 states that
requests for records should be addressed to the General Counsel of OGE. Requesters will generally be required to submit
FOIA requests in writing. Each request should contain sufficient detail to allow the Office to locate the record with
a reasonable amount of effort. If a request is too broad or too vague to allow the Office to locate the record with a reasonable
amount of effort, the Office would assist the requester in revising the request as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of a request would be deemed to constitute an agreement to pay any applicable fees up to $25.00, unless a waiver
were sought. The request could also specify a limit on fees the requester is willing to pay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel of OGE, or his designee, has been delegated responsibility in proposed &sect;2604.302 to grant
or deny requests and to determine appropriate fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the terms of proposed &sect;2604.302(b), OGE will ordinarily refer FOIA requests for records that
originated in another Government agency to the other agency for response. In such cases, the requester will be notified
of the referral. Section 2604.302(c) as proposed specifies that, in cases where a requester asks for a record in a format
which does not currently exist, OGE will provide whatever records reasonably respond to the request, but will not
create a new record in order to respond. Under &sect;2604.302(d) of the proposed rule, if a record cannot be located
from the information supplied, the General Counsel will so inform the requester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;2604.303 requires the General Counsel to notify a requester in writing of the determination to grant
a request in whole or in part. The response must describe the manner in which the record will be disclosed and inform
the requester of any fees which will be charged. Similarly, the General Counsel's determination to deny a request
in whole or in part must be made in writing and signed by the General Counsel (or his designee). Consistent with &sect;2604.303(b)
as proposed, any denial is to contain a brief statement describing the basis for the denial, including the FOIA exemptions
which were relied upon. Moreover, the denial must state that requesters have a right to appeal and must explain OGE's
appeal procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office's appeal procedures are set forth in &sect;2604.304 of the proposed rule. Denials may be appealed to OGE's
Deputy Director within 30 days after receipt of a denial letter. Appeals must be in writing and must contain reasons
or arguments in support of disclosure. The Office will respond to appeals in writing, and will specify the reason for
affirming any original denial. When a denial is reversed in whole or in part, the request for disclosure will be processed
promptly. The decision on appeal is the Office's final action on a request. Requesters have a right to seek judicial
review of the action under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2604.305 of the proposed rule describes the time limits to which the Office will adhere in responding to requests.
The time limits may be extended up to a total of 10 working days in unusual circumstances, i.e., when the records are
in a location other than the Office, the request is for a large number of records, or the Office must consult with another
agency or consult with various OGE components.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions from its mandatory disclosure provisions. These exemptions
permit an agency to withhold a requested record in certain circumstances. Section 2604.401 in subpart D of the proposed
rule generally references the nine classes of records that may be exempted from disclosure under FOIA. Proposed &sect;2604.401(a)
states that OGE will not withhold a requested record unless it falls within a FOIA exemption and that in deciding whether
to withhold material, OGE will consider whether another statute, Executive order or regulation prohibits release
or, if not, whether there is a need in the public interest to withhold it. Further, under proposed &sect;2604.401(b),
the Office with withhold information which falls within an exemption if the information was furnished on a pledge
of confidentiality authorized by statute, Executive order or regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2604.401(c) also provides that certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes may not be subject
to the requirement of FOIA. Additionally, proposed &sect;2604.401(d) provides for partial application of the exemptions
to a record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;2604.402 contains OGE's procedures for disclosure of business information provided to the Office.
Generally, &sect;2604.402 would require submitters of business information to designate those portions of their
submissions they believe may be exempt from disclosure under any exemption of the FOIA. If records so designated are
subsequently requested under FOIA, in most cases the submitter will have an opportunity to provide a written objection
to disclosure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart E of the proposed rule contains provisions relating to the fees which will be assessed for services rendered
in responding to and processing requests for records under FOIA. Fees are to be based on the type of service provided
(e.g., search, review, duplication) as well as the category of person making the request (e.g., commercial user,
educational institution, news media). Generally, commercial requesters will pay the full amount of permissible
fees; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and news media will pay only duplication costs. As
a matter of policy, OGE will not change fees for any individual request if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. Additionally,
under the proposal OGE may furnish records without charge or at a reduced charge where disclosure of the requested
information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of
the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In
making this determination, OGE will apply the factors suggested by the Department of Justice in the Attorney General's
Memorandum on the 1986 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act dated December, 1987. These factors have been
incorporated in proposed &sect;2604.503.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2604.504 as proposed contains a number of miscellaneous provisions concerning fees, including a requirement
that requesters pay in advance fees likely to exceed $250.00. However, advance payment may not be required in the case
of a requester who has a history of prompt payment.

On or before March 15 of each year, the Office sends a report of OGE's FOIA activities for the prior calendar year to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. Section 2604.602 of the proposed rule lists
the information included in this annual report.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 105(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, requires an agency, with certain limited exceptions,
to make available to the public any public financial disclosure report (SF 278) filed with the agency. Section 105(b)(1)
permits an agency to charge a fee adequate to recover the cost of reproduction and mailing of a public financial disclosure
report (SF 278) requested by any person in accordance with the requirements of section 105. However, the fee may not
include any charge attributable to the salary of any employee involved in the reproduction or mailing of these reports.
To implement this provision for such reports filed with it, OGE is proposing to create a fee structure separate from
the FOIA fee structure set forth in subpart E of this proposed rule. Proposed subpart G contains provisions to implement
this authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2604.702 as proposed provides that public financial disclosure reports will be furnished upon payment of
$.03 per page and the actual direct cost of mailing. The $.03 per page charge includes the actual cost of the paper used
and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. It does not include any overhead charges (such as lighting and heat),
nor does it include the salary of any employee involved in operating a duplicating machine. No change will be made for
individual requests if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. Proposed &sect;2604.702(d) specifically provides
that the miscellaneous fee provisions in &sect;2604.504 of subpart E will apply to requests for public financial
disclosure reports (SF 278s). However, no other provisions in subpart E concerning fees, fee waivers, and fee reductions
apply to requests for public financial disclosure reports.

This part contains the regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) implementing the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) and Executive order 12600. It describes how any person may obtain records from OGE under the FOIA. It also
implements section105(b)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, which authorizes an agency to charge
reasonable fees to cover the cost of reproduction and mailing of public financial disclosure reports requested by
any person.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FOIA and this rule apply to all OGE records. However, if another law sets forth procedures for the disclosure of
specific types of records, such as section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. appendix, OGE will process
a request for those records in accordance with the procedures that apply to those specific records. See 5 CFR 2634.603
and subpart G of this part. If there is any record which is not required to be released under those provisions, OGE will
consider the request under the FOIA and this rule, provided that the special Ethics Act access procedures cited must
be complied with as to any record within the scope thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about individuals, but only if the records are in
a system of records as defined in the Privacy Act. Requests from individuals for records about themselves which are
contained in an OGE system of records will be processed under the provision of the Privacy Act as well as the FOIA. OGE
will not deny access by a first party to a record under the FOIA or the Privacy Act unless the record is not available to
that individual under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Records available through routine distribution procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the record requested includes material published and offered for sale (e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing Office) or which is available to the public through an established distribution system (such
as that of the National Technical Information Service of the Department of Commerce), OGE will instead explain how
the record may be obtained through those channels.

that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request
is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the use to which the records
will be put. When a request is from a representative of the news media, a purpose or use supporting the requester's news
dissemination function is not a commercial use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each request must reasonably describe the desired records in sufficient detail to enable Office personnel to locate
the records with a reasonable amount of effort. A request for a specific category of records will be regarded as fulfilling
this requirement if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably
burdensome or disruptive of Office operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Wherever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date,
title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the General Counsel determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, he will either
advise the requester what additional information is needed to locate the record, or otherwise state why the request
is insufficient. The General Counsel will also extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with Office personnel
with the objective of reformulating the request in a manner which will meet the requirements of this section.

Agreement to pay fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The filing of a request under this subpart will be deemed to constitute an agreement by the requester to pay all applicable
fees charged under subpart E of this part, up to $25.00, unless a waiver of fees is sought. The request may also specify
a limit on the amount the requester is willing to spend, or may indicate a willingness to pay an amount greater than $25.00,
if applicable. In cases where a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees may amount to more that $25.00,
the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a requester seeks records that originated in another Government agency, OGE will normally refer the request
to the other agency for response. If OGE refers the request to another agency, it will notify the requester of the referral.
If release of certain records may adversely affect United States relations with foreign governments, the Office
will usually consult with the Department of State. A request for any records classified by some other agency will be
referred to that agency for response.

If a person seeks information from OGE in a format that does not currently exist, OGE will not ordinarily reformat the
information for the purpose of responding to the request. OGE will advise the requester that it does not have the record
in the format sought, but will provide whatever records in existing formats that would reasonably respond to the request.
Additionally, OGE will not generally develop a new record of information to satisfy a request.

After the General Counsel has made a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, the requester will be notified
in writing. The notice shall describe the manner in which the record will be disclosed, whether by providing a copy
of the record with the response or at a later date, or by making a copy of the record available to the requester for inspection
at a reasonable time and place. The procedure for such an inspection may not unreasonably disrupt the operations of

 The disposition of an appeal will be in writing and will constitute the final action of the Office on a request. A decision
affirming in whole or in part the denial of a request will include a brief statement of the reason or reasons for affirmance,
including each FOIA exemption relied on. If the denial of a request is reversed in whole or in part on appeal, the request
will be processed promptly in accordance with the decision on appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Policy on application of exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions to the mandatory disclosure of records.
A requested record will not be withheld from inspection or copying unless it comes within one of the classes of records
exempted by 5 U.S.C. 552. In making its determination on withholding, OGE will consider whether another statute,
Executive order or regulation prohibits release or, if not, whether there is a need in the public interest to withhold
material which is otherwise exempt under FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pledge of confidentiality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information obtained from any individual or organization, furnished in reliance on a provision for confidentiality
authorized by applicable statute, Executive order or regulation, will not be disclosed to the extent it can be withheld
under one of the exemptions. However, this paragraph does not itself authorized the giving of any pledge of confidentiality
by any officer or employee of the Office of Government Ethics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exception for law enforcement information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office may treat records compiled for law enforcement purposes as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom
of Information Act when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is unaware of its pendency; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably by expected to interfere with the enforcement
proceedings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Designation of business information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Submitters of business information should use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either
at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions which they deem to
be protected under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted
to the Government, unless the submitter requests, and provides reasonable justification for, a designation period
of longer duration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Predisclosure notification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The General Counsel will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request regarding its business information
if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The information has been designated by the submitter as information deemed protected from disclosure under Exemption
4 of the FOIA; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The General Counsel has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption
4 of the FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies
of the records containing the business information. The requester also shall be notified that notice and an opportunity
to object are being provided to a submitter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A submitter has five working days from receipt of the predisclosure notification to provide a written statement of
any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all the grounds for withholding any of the information
under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is deemed to be
a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided
by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of intent to disclose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The General Counsel will consider all objections raised by a submitter and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior
to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever the General Counsel decides to disclose business
information over the objection of a submitter, he will send the submitter a written notice at least 10 working days
before the date of disclosure containing:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manual searches for records.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Whenever feasible, the office will charge at the salary rate (i.e., basic pay plus 16%) of the employee making the search.
However, where a homogeneous class of personnel is used exclusively in a search (e.g., all clerical time or all professional
time) the Office will charge $10.00 per hour for clerical time and $20.00 per hour for professional time. Charges for
search time will be billed by fifteen minute segments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computer searches for records.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requesters will be charged the actual direct cost of conducting a search using existing programming. These direct
costs shall include the cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly
attributable to searching for records responsive to a request, as well as the cost of operator/programmer salary
apportionable to the search. The Office will not alter or develop programming to conduct a search.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unproductive searches.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office will charge search fees even if no records are found which are responsive to the request, of if the records
found are exempt from disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duplication.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The standard copying charge for documents in paper copy is $.15 per page. When responsive information is provided
in a format other than paper copy, such as in the form of computer tapes and discs, the requester may be charged the direct
costs of the tape, disc, or whatever medium is used to produce the information, as well as any related reproduction
costs.

Review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Costs associated with the review of documents, as defined in &sect;2604.104(q), will be charged at the salary rate
(i.e., basic pay plus 16%) of the employee conducting the review. Except as noted below, charges may be assessed only
for review at the initial level, i.e., the review undertaken the first time the documents are analyzed to determine
the applicability of specific exemptions to a particular record or portion of the records. A requester will not be
charged for review at the administrative appeal level concerning the applicability of an exemption already applied
at the initial level. However, when a record has been withheld pursuant to an exemption which is subsequently determined
not to apply and the record is reviewed again at the appeal level to determine the potential applicability of other
exemptions, the costs of such additional review may be assessed.

Fees for various requester categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The paragraphs below state, for each category of requester, the type of fees generally charged by the Office. However,
for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived or reduced in accordance with the provisions set forth
in &sect;2604.503. In determining whether a requester belongs in any of the following categories, the Office will
determine the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. If the Office has reasonable cause to doubt
the use to which the requester will put the records sought, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, the
Office will seek clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.

 The Office will charge the full costs of search, review, and duplication. Commercial use requesters are not entitled
to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction as described in &sect;2604.503(a); however, the
de minimis fees provision of &sect;2604.503(b) does apply to such requesters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use as described in &sect;2604.502(b), the Office will provide,
without charge, the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time, or their cost equivalent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
De minimis fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office will not assess fees for individual requests if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver or reduction of fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Records responsive to a request under 5 U.S.C. 552 will be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where the
Office determines, based upon information provided by a requester in support of a fee waiver request, that disclosure
of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of
the requester. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, the Office will consider the following
factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of
the Government. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request, must specifically and directly concern
identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their
information value with respect to those Government operations or activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the information is likely to contribute to an understanding
of Government operations or activies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully information on specific Government operations
or activities in order to hold potential for contributing to increased public understanding of those operations
and activities. The disclosure of information which is already in the public domain, in either a duplicative or substantially
identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would be added to the public
record; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure
of the requested information will contribute to public understanding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding
of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons. A requester's identity and qualifications e.g., expertise
in the subject area and ability and intention to convey information to the general public_will be considered; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding of Government operations or activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The public's understanding of the subject matter in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing
prior to the disclosure, must be likely to be significantly enhanced by the disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining whether disclosure of the requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of
the requester, the Office will consider the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would
be furthered by the requested disclosure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office will consider all commercial interests of the requester, or any person on whose behalf the requester may
be acting, which would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In assessing the magnitude of identified commercial
interests, consideration will be given to the effect that the information disclosed would have on those commercial
interests; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester
is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A fee waiver or reduction is warranted only where the public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in magnitude
than the requester's commercial interest in disclosure. The Office will ordinarily presume that, where a news media
requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be served primarily by disclosure
to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers and others who compile and market Government information for direct
economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Where only a portion of the requested record satisfies the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under
this paragraph, a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A request for a waiver or reduction of fees must accompany the request for disclosure of records, and should include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear statement of the requester's interest in the documents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The proposed use of the documents and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A statement of how the public will benefit from release of the requested documents; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If specialized use of the documents is contemplated, a statement of the requester's qualifications that are
relevant to the specialized use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A requester may appeal the denial of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees in accordance with the provisions
of &sect;2604.304.

Miscellaneous fee provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where the Office determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under this section may amount to more than $25.00,
the Office shall notify the requester as soon as practicable of the actual or estimated amount of fees, unless the requester
has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Where a requester has been notified
that the actual or estimated fees may exceed $25.00, the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester
has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee. A notice to the requester pursuant to this paragraph will include the opportunity
to confer with Office personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aggragating requests.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A requester may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents in order to avoid the payment
of fees. Where there is reason to believe that a requester or group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to
divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Office may aggregate
the requests and charge accordingly. The Office will presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day
period have been made in order to evade fees. Multiple requests regarding unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An advance payment before work is commenced or continued will not be required unless:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Office estimates or determines that the total fee to be assessed under this section is likely to exceed $250.00.
When a determination is made that the allowable charges are likely to exceed $250.00, the requester will be notified
of the likely cost and will be required to provide satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a
history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or will be required to submit an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated
charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the
billing). In such cases the requester may be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided
by paragraph (e) of this section, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Office
begins to process a new request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the Office requests an advance payment of fees, the administrative time limits described in subsection (a)(6)
of the FOIA will begin to run only after the Office has received the advance payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Billing and payment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Normally the Office will require a requester to pay all fees before furnishing the requested records. However, the
Office may send a bill along with, or following the furnishing of records, in cases where the requester has a history
of prompt payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interest charges.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interest charges on an unpaid bill may be assessed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was
sent. Interest shall be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the date of billing. To collect
unpaid bills, the Office will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (P.L. 97&hyph;365) including
the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is proposing to revise its regulations on the Administrative Remedy Program.
These regulations describe the process through which inmates may seek formal review of any issue related to their
confinement. The proposed changes are deemed necessary in order to attend to increased numbers of remedy requests
occasioned by the continued growth of the inmate population. Proposed procedural changes include increases in the
time limits set for inmate filing of requests and for Bureau responses; additional specifications for the provision
of assistance to inmates; and increased access to Administrative Remedy indexes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on the Administrative Remedy Program. A final rule on this
subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 29, 1979 (44 FR 62250), and was amended December 27, 1979 (44 FR 76726), November 20, 1991 (56 FR 58634), and
on October 29, 1993 (58 FR 58246). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision set forth below is the first major change to the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program since
its adoption on October 29, 1979. Subsequent growth of the inmate population has resulted in an increase in the number
of remedy requests filed. As a means of effectively addressing this situation, the Bureau has reorganized its regulation,
currently entitled Administrative Remedy Procedure for Inmates, for the sake of clarity, and is proposing various
efficiencies in the procedures for processing remedy requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedural efficiencies include making adjustments to the time limits for filing requests by inmates and for responses
by the Bureau. The time limit for submission of an initial remedy request by an inmate has been lengthened to 20 calendar
days following the date on which the basis for the request had occurred. Current regulations specify a 15-day limit.
The time limit for submission of an appeal to the General Counsel has been lengthened to 30 calendar days following
the date Regional Counsel signed the response. The proposed time limits for agency responses have also been lengthened,
from 15 to 20 calendar days at the institution level, and from 30 to 40 calendar days at the Central Office level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional revisions include additional guidelines in the following areas: informal resolution, forms, and assistance
to inmates. Also, advances in recordkeeping technology have now made it possible to expand the provisions for access
to remedy indexes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons, has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing
to the Bureau of Prisons, 320 First Street, NW., HOLC Room 754, Washington, DC 20534. Comments received during the
comment period will be considered before final action is taken. All comments received remain on file for public inspection
at the above address. The proposed rule may be changed in light of the comments received. No oral hearings are contemplated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Remedy Program is a process through which inmates may seek formal review of an issue which relates
to any aspect of their confinement, except as excluded in &sect;542.12, if less formal procedures have not resolved
the matter. This Program applies to all inmates confined in Bureau of Prisons institutions, to inmates designated
to contract Community Corrections Centers (CCCs) under Bureau of Prisons responsibility, and to former inmates
for issues that arose during their confinement, but does not apply to inmates confined in other non-federal facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Acknowledge receipt of a Request or Appeal by returning a receipt to the inmate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Conduct an investigation into each Request or Appeal; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Respond to and sign all Requests or Appeals filed at their levels. At the regional level, signatory authority may
be delegated to the Deputy Regional Director. At the Central Office level, signatory authority may be delegated to
the National Inmate Appeals Administrator. Signatory authority extends to staff designated as acting in the capacities
specified in this &sect;542.11, but may not be further delegated without the written approval of the General Counsel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Inmates have the responsibility to use this Program in good faith and in an honest and straightforward manner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An inmate may not use this Program to submit a Request or Appeal on behalf of another inmate. This program is intended
to address concerns that are personal to the inmate making the Request or Appeal, but shall not prevent an inmate from
obtaining assistance in preparing a Request or Appeal, as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;542.16 of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Requests or Appeals will not be accepted under the Administrative Remedy Program for claims for which other administrative
procedures have been established, including tort claims, Inmate Accident Compensation claims, and Freedom of Information
or Privacy Act requests. Staff shall inform the inmate in writing of the appropriate administrative procedure if
the Request or Appeal is not acceptable under the Administrative Remedy Program.

Informal Resolution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in &sect;542.13(b), an inmate shall first present an issue of concern informally to staff, and
staff shall attempt to informally resolve the issue before an inmate submits a Request for Administrative Remedy.

Exceptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inmates in CCCs are not required to attempt informal resolution. An informal resolution attempt is not required prior
to submission to the Regional or Central Office as provided for in &sect;542.14(d) of this part. An informal resolution
attempt may be waived in individual cases at the Warden or institution Administrative Remedy Coordinator's discretion
when the inmate demonstrates an acceptable reason for bypassing informal resolution.

Extension. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the inmate demonstrates a valid reason for delay, an extension in filing time may be allowed. In general, valid
reason for delay means a situation which prevented the inmate from submitting the request within the established
time frame. Valid reasons for delay include the following: an extended period in-transit during which the inmate
was separated from documents needed to prepare the Request or Appeal; an extended period of time during which the inmate
was physically incapable of preparing a Request or Appeal; an unusually long period taken for informal resolution
attempts; indication by an inmate, verified by staff, that a response to the inmate's request for copies of dispositions
requested under &sect;542.19 of this part has not been received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The inmate shall obtain the appropriate form from CCC staff or institution staff (ordinarily, the correctional
counselor). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The inmate shall place a single complaint or a reasonable number of closely related issues on the form. If the inmate
includes on a single form multiple unrelated issues, the submission shall be rejected and returned without response,
and the inmate shall be advised to use a separate form for each unrelated issue. For DHO and UDC appeals, each separate
incident report number must be appealed on a separate form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The inmate shall complete the form with all requested identifying information and shall state the complaint in
the space provided on the form. If more space is needed, the inmate may use up to one letter-size (8 1/2
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; by 11
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;) continuation page. The inmate must provide an additional three copies of any continuation page. The inmate
must submit one copy of supporting exhibits. Exhibits will not be returned with the response. Because copies of exhibits
must be filed for any appeal (see &sect;542.15(b)(3)), the inmate is encouraged to retain a copy of all exhibits for
his or her personal records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The inmate shall date and sign the Request and submit it to the institution staff member designated to receive such
Requests (ordinarily a correctional counselor). CCC inmates may mail their Requests to the CCM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions to initial filing at institution_(1) Sensitive issues
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the inmate reasonably believes the issue is sensitive and the inmate's safety or well-being would be placed in
danger if the Request became known at the institution, the inmate may submit the Request directly to the appropriate
Regional Director. The inmate shall clearly mark ``Sensitive'' upon the Request and explain, in writing, the reason
for not submitting the Request at the institution. If the Regional Administrative Remedy Coordinator agrees that
the Request is sensitive, the Request shall be accepted. Otherwise, the Request will not be accepted, and the inmate
shall be advised in writing of that determination, without a return of the Request. The inmate may pursue the matter
by submitting an Administrative Remedy Request locally to the Warden. The Warden shall allow a reasonable extension
of time for such a resubmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DHO appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DHO appeals shall be submitted initially to the Regional Director for the region where the inmate is currently located.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Control unit appeals.

An inmate who is not satisfied with the Warden's response may submit an Appeal on the appropriate form (BP&hyph;10)
to the appropriate Regional Director within 20 calendar days of the date the Warden signed the response. An inmate
who is not satisfied with the Regional Director's response may submit an Appeal on the appropriate form (BP&hyph;11)
to the General Counsel within 30 calendar days of the date the Regional Director signed the response. When the inmate
demonstrates a valid reason for delay, these time limits may be extended. Valid reasons for delay include those situations
described in &sect;542.14(b) of this part. Appeal to the General Counsel is the final administrative appeal.

Counsel shall be submitted on the form designed for Central Office Appeals (BP&hyph;11) and accompanied by one complete
copy or duplicate original of the institution and regional filings and their responses. Appeals shall state specifically
the reason for appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&rsquo;) continuation page. The inmate shall provide two additional copies of any continuation page and exhibits
with the regional Appeal, and three additional copies with an Appeal to the Central Office (the inmate is also to provide
copies of exhibits used at the prior level(s) of appeal). The inmate shall date and sign the Appeal and mail it to the
appropriate Regional Director, if a Regional Appeal, or to the National Inmate Appeals Section, Office of General
Counsel, if a Central Office Appeal (see 28 CFR part 503 for addresses of the Central Office and Regional Offices).

(a) An inmate may obtain assistance from another inmate or from institution staff in preparing a Request or an Appeal.
An inmate may also obtain assistance from outside sources, such as family members or attorneys. However, no person
may submit a Request or Appeal on the inmate's behalf, and obtaining assistance will not be considered a valid reason
for exceeding a time limit for submission unless the delay was caused by staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Wardens shall ensure that assistance is available for inmates who are illiterate, disabled, or who are not functionally
literate in English. Such assistance includes provision of reasonable accommodation in order for an inmate with
a disability to prepare and process a Request or an Appeal.

When a submission is rejected, the inmate shall be provided a written notice, signed by the Administrative Remedy
Coordinator, explaining the reason for rejection. If the defect on which the rejection is based is correctable, the

When a Request or Appeal is rejected and the inmate is not given an opportunity to correct the defect and resubmit, the
inmate may appeal the rejection, including a rejection on the basis of an exception as described in &sect;542.14(d),
to the next appeal level. The Coordinator at that level may affirm the rejection, may direct that the submission be
accepted at the lower level (either upon the inmate's resubmission or direct return to that lower level), or may accept
the submission for filing. The inmate shall be informed of the decision by delivery of either a receipt or rejection
notice.

If accepted, a Request or Appeal is considered filed on the date it is logged into the Administrative Remedy Index as
received. Once filed, response shall be made by the Warden or CCM within 20 calendar days; by the Regional Director
within 30 calendar days; and by the General Counsel within 40 calendar days. If the Request is determined to be of an
emergency nature which threatens the inmate's immediate health or welfare, the Warden shall respond not later than
the third calendar day after filing. If the time period for response to a Request or Appeal is insufficient to make an
appropriate decision, the time for response may be extended once by 20 days at the institution level, 30 days at the
regional level, or 20 days at the Central Office. Staff shall inform the inmate of this extension in writing. Staff
shall respond in writing to all filed Requests or Appeals. If the inmate does not receive a response within the time
allotted for reply, including extension, the inmate may consider the absence of a response to be a denial at that level.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Amendments Responsive to Adoption of Public Law 103&hyph;182
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Several of the proposed amendments to the interference rules (i.e., 37 CFR 1.601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are responsive to Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (1993) (North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act), which amended 35 U.S.C. 104 to permit reliance on activities occurring in a ``NAFTA country'' to prove a date
of invention. Paragraph (b) of &sect;104 as amended states that ``the term `NAFTA country' has the meaning given that
term in section 2(4) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.'' That section of Public Law 103&hyph;182
has been codified at 19 U.S.C. 3301(4), which reads:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) NAFTA Country
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in section 3332 of this title, the term ``NAFTA country'' means_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Canada for such time as the [North American Free Trade] Agreement is in force with respect to, and the United States
applies the Agreement to, Canada; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Mexico for such time as the Agreement is in force with respect to, and the United States applies the Agreement to,
Mexico.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, it is proposed to amend 37 CFR 1.601 by adding a new paragraph (r) defining the term ``NAFTA country''
and ``non-NAFTA country'' and to amend the following interference rules, which set forth the requirements for preliminary
statements, so as to permit reliance on activities occurring in a NAFTA country: &sect;&sect;1.622(b), 1.623(a),
1.624(a) and 1.628(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
37 CFR 1.684, which relates to the taking of testimony in a foreign country, is proposed to be deleted and reserved in
view of proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;1.671 and 1.672. Section 1.671 is proposed to be amended by redesignating
paragraph (h) as paragraph (i) and adding new paragraphs (h) and (j). New paragraph (h) would set forth the requirements
for a motion &sect;1.635 to compel testimony or the production of documents or things in a foreign country. New paragraph
(j) would provide that the weight to be given testimony taken in a foreign country will be determined on a case-by-case
basis. Little, if any, weight would be given to testimony taken in a foreign country unless the party taking the testimony
proves by clear and convincing evidence (1) that giving false testimony in an interference proceeding is punishable
as perjury under the laws of the foreign country where the testimony is taken and (2) that the punishment in a foreign
country for giving such false testimony is similar to the punishment for perjury committed in the United States. The
proposed amendments to &sect;1.672 include amending paragraphs (a) and (b), redesignating current paragraphs
(c) through (f) as paragraphs (e) through (h) and adding new provisions identified as paragraphs (c) and (d). Paragraph
(a) as proposed to be amended would limit a party's case-in-chief testimony to affidavits, except where testimony
is to be compelled under 35 U.S.C. 24 or compelled from a party or in a foreign country. New paragraph (c) would provide
that where an opponent objects to the admissibility of any evidence contained in or submitted with an affidavit, the
opponent must file and serve objections stating with particularity the nature of the objection, to which the party
may respond by filing supplemental affidavits and supplemental official records and printed publications. New
paragraph (c) further would provide that any objections to the admissibility of any evidence contained in or submitted
with a supplemental affidavit shall be by a motion to suppress under &sect;1.656(h). New paragraph (d) of &sect;1.672
would require any cross-examination of affiants to be by deposition within the United States, which is defined in
current &sect;1.601(p) as the United States of America, its territories and possessions. New paragraph (d) of &sect;1.672
would require that the party whose witness is to be cross-examined notice the deposition under &sect;1.673(e), obtain
a court reporter and provide a translator of the witness will not testify in English. Although not set forth in the proposed
rules, any party attending the deposition can bring its own translator or the parties can agree to share the cost of
single mutually agreeable translator. Paragraphs (g) and (h) of &sect;1.671 as proposed to be amended would provide
that a party seeking to compel testimony or production of documents or things pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 24 or to compel testimony
or production from a party or in a foreign country would have to first file a &sect;1.635 motion to obtain permission
from an administrative patent judge. A motion to compel testimony or the production of documents or things in a foreign
country would have to show that the witness has been asked to testify in the United States and has refused to do so or that
the individual or entity having possession, custody, and control of the document or thing has refused to produce the
document or thing in the United States, even though the moving party has offered to pay the expenses involved in bringing
the witness or the document or thing to the United States. When permission has been obtained from the administrative
patent judge, the party, after also complying with the current requirements for an oral conference (&sect;1.673(g))
and service of documents and a proffer of access to things (&sect;1.673(b)), would be required to notice the deposition
under &sect;1.673(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.616 is proposed to be amended by adding a paragraph (c) stating that to the extent that any information under
the control of an individual or entity located in a NAFTA country concerning knowledge, use, or other activity relevant
to proving or disproving a date of invention has been ordered to be produced by an administrative patent judge or the
Board (&sect;1.671(h)), but is not produced for use in the interference to the same extent as such information could
be made available in the United States, the administrative patent judge or the Board shall draw such adverse inferences
as may be appropriate under the circumstances, or take such other action permitted by statute, rule, or regulation,
in favor of the party that requested the information in the interference, including imposition of appropriate sanctions
under &sect;1.616(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.647, which currently requires a party who relies on a non-English language document to provide an English-language
translation and an affidavit attesting to its accuracy, is proposed to be amended to extend these requirements to
non-English language documents that a party is required to produce via discovery (see &sect;1.671(h)).

II. Attorney Fees and Expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.616 is proposed to be amended by redesignating current paragraphs (a) through (e) as paragraphs (a)(1)
through (a)(4) and (a)(6) and adding new paragraphs (a)(5) and (b). New paragraph (a)(5) would authorize the award
of compensatory (as opposed to punitive) expenses and/or attorney fees as a sanction for failing to comply with the
rules or an order, since there are occasions when such a sanction would be more commensurate in scope with the infraction
than the sanctions that are currently authorized. New paragraph (b) would authorize the imposition of a sanction,
including a sanction in the form of compensatory expenses and/or attorney fees, against a party for taking or maintaining
a frivolous position.

III. Certificates of Prior Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;1.637 currently requires that a miscellaneous motion under &sect;1.635 contain a certificate
stating that the moving party has conferred with all opponents in a good faith effort to resolve by agreement the issues
raised by the motion and indicating whether any other party plans to oppose the motion. It is proposed to amend paragraph
(b) to extend the requirement for such a certificate to motions filed under &sect;&sect;1.633 and 1.634 and also to
require the certificate to indicate that the reasons and facts in support of the motion were discussed with each opponent
and, if an opponent has indicated that it will oppose the motion, to identify the issues and/or facts believed to be
in dispute. The proposed requirement for consultation should result in a reduction in the number of issues raised
by motions under &sect;1.633 and 1.634 as well as a reduction in the number of motions filed under those rules.

IV. Service of a ``Developing Record'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the amendments to &sect;1.672 discussed above under the heading ``Amendments responsive to adoption
of Public Law 103&hyph;182,'' it is proposed to amend &sect;&sect;1.672, 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 to require each party
to serve on each opponent a ``developing record'' that will evolve into the record required to be filed under &sect;1.653.
Specifically, in &sect;1.672, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) to provide that a party presenting testimony
of a witness by affidavit shall, no later than the time set by the administrative patent judge for serving affidavits,
file (which includes serve) the affidavit, whether it is a new affidavit or an affidavit that was previously filed
by that party during 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prosecution of an application or under &sect;1.608 or 1.639(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 are proposed to be amended to parallel the proposed amendments to &sect;1.672. Specifically,
paragraph (a) of &sect;1.682 as proposed to be amended would provide that a party may introduce into evidence, if otherwise
admissible, an official record or printed publication not identified in an affidavit or on the record during an oral
deposition of a witness, by filing (which includes serving) a copy of the official record or publication no later than
the time set for filing affidavits under &sect;1.672(b), thereby dispensing with the current requirement to file
a notice of intent to rely on the official record or printed publication. In &sect;1.683, paragraph (a) as proposed
to be amended would provide that a party may introduce into evidence, if otherwise admissible, testimony by affidavit
or oral deposition from another interference, proceeding, or action involving the same parties by filing (which
includes serving) a copy of the affidavit or a copy of the deposition transcript no later than the time set for filing
affidavits under &sect;1.672(b), thereby dispensing with the current requirement for a party to file a motion under
&sect;1.635 for leave to rely on such testimony. Section 1.688 as proposed to be amended would provide that, if otherwise
admissible, a party may introduce into evidence an answer to a written request for an admission or an answer to a written
interrogatory obtained by discovery under &sect;1.687 by filing a copy of the request for admission or the written
interrogatory and the answer no later than the time set for filing affidavits under &sect;1.672(b). Thus, all evidence
filed under &sect;&sect;1.672, 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 that relates to a party's case-in-chief should be filed together
no later than the date set by an administrative patent judge for the party to serve affidavits under &sect;1.672(b)
for its case-in-chief and all evidence under those sections that relates to the party's rebuttal should be filed no
later than the date set for the party to serve affidavits under &sect;1.672(b) for its case-in-rebuttal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pages of all affidavits and deposition transcripts would be required to have sequential numbers that would also
serve as the record page numbers for the affidavits and transcripts in the party's record when it is filed under &sect;1.653.
Likewise, the exhibits identified in the affidavits and deposition transcripts and any official records and printed
publications served under &sect;1.682(a) would be required to have sequential numbers which would serve as the exhibit
numbers when the exhibits are filed with the party's record. Affidavits and &sect;1.683(a) testimony would have
to be accompanied by an index giving the name of each witness and the number of the page where the testimony of each witness
begins. The exhibits would have to be accompanied by an index briefly describing the nature of each exhibit and giving
the number of the page of affidavit or &sect;1.683(a) testimony where each exhibit identified in an affidavit or during
an oral deposition is first identified and offered into evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An opponent who objects to the admissibility of any evidence filed under &sect;&sect;1.672(b), 1.682(b), 1.683(a)
and 1.688(a) would have to file objections under &sect;&sect;1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) and 1.688(b) no later
than the date set by the administrative patent judge for filing objections to affidavits under paragraph &sect;1.672(c).
An opponent who fails to challenge the admissibility of the evidence on a ground that could have been raised in a timely
objection under &sect;&sect;1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) would not be permitted to move under &sect;1.656(h)
to suppress the evidence on that ground. If an opponent timely files an objection to evidence filed under &sect;&sect;1.672(b),
1.682(b), 1.683(a) or 1.688(a), the party may respond by filing supplemental affidavits and, in the case of objections
to evidence filed under &sect;&sect;1.672(b), 1.682(b) and 1.683(a), may also file supplemental official records
and printed publications. No objection to the admissibility of supplemental evidence shall be made, except as provided
by &sect;1.656(h). The page numbers of the supplemental affidavits would be sequentially numbered beginning with
the number following the last page number of the testimony served under &sect;&sect;1.672(b), 1.683(a) and 1.688(a).
Likewise, any additional exhibits identified in the supplemental affidavits and any supplemental official records
and printed publications would be given sequential numbers beginning with the number following the last number of
the previously identified exhibits. After the time expires for filing objections and supplemental affidavits,
or earlier when appropriate, the administrative patent judge would set a time within which any opponent may file a
request to cross-examine an affiant on oral deposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any opponent requests cross-examination of an affiant, the party shall notice a deposition at a reasonable location
within the United States under &sect;1.673(e) for the purpose of cross-examination. Any redirect and recross shall
take place at the deposition. Within 45 days of the close of the period for taking cross-examination (&sect;1.678
is proposed to be amended to change the time for filing certified transcripts from 45 days to 30 days), the party would
serve (but not file) a copy of each deposition transcript on each opponent together with copies of any additional documentary
exhibits identified by a witness during a deposition. The pages of the transcripts served under this paragraph and
the accompanying exhibits would be sequentially numbered in the manner discussed above. The deposition transcripts
would be accompanied by an index of the names of the witnesses, giving the number of the page where cross-examination,
redirect and recross of each witness begins, and an index of exhibits of the type specified in &sect;1.672(b). At this
point in time, the opponent will have been served with all of the testimony that will appear in the party's record (with
the same page numbers) as well as all of the documentary exhibits that will accompany the record (with the same exhibit
numbers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed amendments to &sect;1.672 would require a party, during its testimony period, to file all affidavits
on which it intends to rely at final hearing, it is proposed to delete as unnecessary paragraph (e) of &sect;1.671,
which requires a party to give notice of intent to rely on an affidavit filed by that party during

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout the rules, the term ``examiner-in-chief'' has been replaced by ``administrative patent judge'' to reflect
the change in the title of the members of the Board. See Commissioner's Notice of October 13, 1993, published as ``New
Title for Examiners-in-Chief,'' 1156 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 332 (Nov. 9, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.11, it is proposed to amend paragraph (e) to allow access to the file on an interference involving a reissue
application once the interference has terminated or an award of priority or judgment has been entered as to all counts.
Although it was intended that the public have access to any interference that involves a case which is open to the public
and &sect;1.11(b) provides that a reissue application is open to the public, interferences involving reissue applications
were inadvertently not included in current &sect;1.11(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.192, which specifies the contents of the brief of an appellant for final hearing in an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 appeal, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) in three respects. The first proposal is to simplify the language used
to refer to a brief filed by an applicant who is not represented by a registered practitioner. The second is to delete
the requirement that such a brief be in substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (6)
and (7), because experience has shown that it is better to evaluate such briefs on a case-by-case basis. The third is
to codify the ``good cause'' standard that is currently used to determine whether the Board will consider any arguments
or authorities not included in the brief. It is proposed to make clarifying amendments to paragraphs (c), (c)(5) and
(c)(5)(ii), to redesignate current paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) as paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(9), and to
add new paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) that would require an appellant who has filed an appeal to the Board to identify
the real party in interest and any related appeals and interferences. The proposed requirement to identify the real
party in interest is derived from Federal Circuit Rule 47.4 and Federal Circuit Form 7. For some time, it has been necessary
to know the identity of the real party in interest. This information would permit members of the Board to comply with
ethics regulations associated with working on matters in which the member has an interest. The proposed requirement
to identify related appeals and interferences is derived in part from Federal Circuit Rule 47.5 and, if adopted, would
prevent the Board from entering inconsistent decisions in related cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.601 is proposed to be amended in several ways. Paragraph (f) as proposed to be amended would specify that
a count should be sufficiently broad as to encompass the broadest corresponding patentable claim of each of the parties
without being so broad as to be unpatentable over the prior art and also to indicate that a phantom count is unpatentable
to all parties under the written description requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. Paragraph (g) as
proposed to be amended would broaden the definition of ``effective filing date'' to mean the actual filing date when
the involved application or patent is not entitled to the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application. Specifically,
paragraph (g) would provide that the effective filing date of an application is the filing date of an earlier application
accorded to the application under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121 or 365, or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the
application. The effective filing date of a patent would be defined as the filing date of an earlier application accorded
to the patent under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application which
matured into the patent. The reference to 35 U.S.C. 121 is included to eliminate any doubt that a divisional application
may be entitled to an earlier filing date in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (j) is proposed to be amended by changing ``which'' to ``that.'' Paragraph (1) is proposed to be amended
by changing ``assignee'' to ``assignee of record in the Patent and Trademark Office.'' Paragraph (q) is proposed
to be amended by deleting ``a panel of'' as superfluous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.602 is proposed to be clarified by changing ``within 20 days of'' to ``within 20 days after.''

Sections 1.603 and 1.606 are proposed to be amended by deleting the third sentence (``Each count shall define a separate
patentable invention.'') as redundant in view of the identical sentence in &sect;1.601(f). In addition, it is proposed
to clarify &sect;&sect;1.603 and 1.606 by amending them to require each application to contain, or be amended to contain,
at least one patentable claim which corresponds to each count.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 1.604, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(1) by changing ``his or her'' to ``its.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.605, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) for clarification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.606 is also proposed to be amended to note that the claim in the application need not be, and most often will
not be, identical to a claim in the patent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.607, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(4) by changing ``his or her'' to ``its'' and to add a new paragraph
(a)(6) requiring an applicant seeking an interference with a patent to demonstrate compliance with 35 U.S.C. 135(b)
which provides:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;1.608, it is proposed to amend paragraphs (a) and (b) in several respects. First, both paragraphs are proposed
to be amended to delete the information about effective filing dates, which would appear instead in &sect;1.601(g)
as proposed to be amended. Second, it is proposed to relax the current requirement of paragraph (a) for an affidavit
filed by the applicant. Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would permit a statement to be filed by the applicant
or a practitioner of record. Third, it is proposed to change ``sufficient cause'' in paragraph (b) and in other interference
rules to ``good cause'' in order to make it clear that only one ``cause'' standard is intended. Fourth, it is proposed
to change ``81/2 x 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to ``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2 x 11 inches).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.609, it is proposed to amend paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) to require the examiner's statement (i.e., the
form PTO&hyph;850, also known as the initial interference memorandum) to explain why each claim designated as corresponding
to a count is directed to the same patentable invention as the count and why each claim designated as not corresponding
to a count is not directed to the same patentable invention as the count. The proposed amendment, if adopted, would
provide the Board and the parties with the benefit of the examiner's reasoning and would provide a better foundation
for considering preliminary motions to designate claims as corresponding or as not corresponding to a count.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.610, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by deleting the language ``a panel consisting of at least three
members of'' as superfluous and by deleting the reference to &sect;1.640(e), which is proposed to be amended to allow
a request for reconsideration under &sect;1.640(c) to be decided by an individual administrative patent judge rather
than by the Board. It is further proposed to amend paragraph (b) by deleting ``Unless otherwise provided in this section,''
as unnecessary in light of the proposed amendment to paragraph (a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.611 is proposed to be amended by redesignating paragraph (a)(8) as paragraph (a)(9) and adding a new paragraph
(a)(8) requiring that a notice of declaration of interference indicate why each claim designated as corresponding
to a count is directed to the same patentable invention as the count and why each claim designated as not corresponding
to a count is not directed to the same patentable invention as the count. This information should assist the parties
in deciding whether to move to have claims designated as corresponding or not corresponding to the count. An administrative
patent judge can satisfy this requirement by enclosing a copy of the examiner's statement with the parties' copies
of the declaration notice. It is also proposed to capitalize the first word in each of paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.612, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to change ``opposing party's'' to ``opponent's'' and to add
a sentence referring to &sect;1.11(e) concerning public access to interference files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.614, it is proposed to clarify the meaning of paragraph (a) by changing ``the Board shall assume jurisdiction''
to ``the Board acquires jurisdiction.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.616, in addition to authorizing an award of compensatory attorney fees and expenses in appropriate circumstances,
as discussed above, it is proposed to amend current paragraph (b) (which is proposed to be redesignated as paragraph
(a)(2)) to permit a party to be sanctioned for failing to comply with the rules or an order by entering an order precluding
the party from filing any type of paper. Paragraph (b) currently permits entry of an order precluding the filing of
a motion or a preliminary statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.617 is proposed to be amended to authorize a party against whom a &sect;1.617(a) order to show cause has been
issued to respond with an appropriate preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c), (f) or (g). A preliminary motion
under &sect;1.633(c) to redefine the interference, under &sect;1.633(f) for benefit of the filing date of an earlier
application or under &sect;1.633(g) attacking the benefit accorded a patentee may be appropriate where the count
set forth in the notice declaring the interference is not the same as the count proposed in the applicant's showing
under &sect;1.608(b). A preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(f) or (g) may also be appropriate where the count set
forth in the notice delcaring the interference is the same as the count proposed in the applicant's showing under &sect;1.608(b),
but the notice either fails to accord the applicant the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application whose benefit
was requested in the &sect;1608(b) showing or accords the parentee the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application
whose benefit the &sect;1.608(b) showing argued should not be accorded the patentee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.618, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) for clarification and to state that a paper that has been returned
as unauthorized will not thereafter be considered in the interference. Paragraph (a) currently states that a paper
that has been returned as unauthorized will not thereafter be considered by the Patent and Trademark Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.625, it is proposed to simplify paragraph (a) by deleting ``the invention was made in the United States
or abroad and'' as surplusage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.626 is proposed to be simplified by changing ``earlier application filed in the United States or aboard''
to ``earlier filed application.'' The same change is proposed for &sect;&sect;1.630, 1.633(f), 1.633(g), 1.637(c)(1)(vi),
1.637(e)(1)(viii), 1.637(e)(2)(vii) and 1.637(h)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.628, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``ends of justice'' to ``interest of justice'' to
be consistent with the language used in &sect;&sect;1.628(a) and 1.687(c), since a single standard is intended.
Paragraph (a) of &sect;1.628 is also proposed to be amended to apply the ``interest of justice'' requirement only
to corrected preliminary statements that are filed on or after the due date for serving preliminary statements. Where
the moving party has not yet seen the opponent's statement, an opponent will not normally be prejudiced by the filing
of a corrected statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.629, it is proposed to amend paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (d) to make them consistent with the proposed amendment
of the definition of ``effective filing date'' in &sect;1.601(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.631, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to delete ``by the examiner-in-chief'' (second occurrence)
as superfluous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.632 is proposed to be amended to more precisely state that a notice of intent to argue abandonment, suppression
or concealment must be filed ``within ten days after,'' rather than ``within ten days of,'' the close of the testimony-in-chief
of the opponent.

If a party believes an opponent's claim corresponding to the count is ambiguous when construed in light of the opponent's
disclosure, the party should move under &sect;1.633(a) for judgment against the claim on the ground of unpatentability
under the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. In paragraph (a), it is also proposed to delete ``by reference to the prior

Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;1.633 are proposed to be amended by deleting some unnecessary language from
each paragraph and by changing ``derivation'' to ``Derivation'' in paragraph (a)(2). Paragraph (b), which concerns
motions for judgment on the ground of no interference-in-fact, is proposed to be amended by stating that it is possible
for claims of opponents presented in ``means plus function'' format to define separate patentable inventions even
though the claims of the opponents contain the same literal wording. The reason is that the sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C.
112, which is applicable to ``means plus function'' limitations in application claims and patent claims, provides
that such limitations are to be construed as covering the corresponding structure disclosed in the associated application
or patent and equivalents thereof.

16 F.3d 1189, 29 USPQ2d 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i) of &sect;1.633 in its current form authorizes a party who opposes a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633
(a), (b) or (g) to file a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633 (c) or (d). It is proposed to amend paragraph (i) to additionally
authorize a party-patentee to file a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(h) to add to the interference an application
for reissue of the party's involved patent. Because a reissue application can include an amended or new claim to be
designated as corresponding to a count, the proposed amendment would give a patentee an option similar to that afforded
in the same situation to a party-applicant, who can file a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c)(2) to amend a claim
in, or add a claim to, its involved application to be designated as corresponding to a count.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.637, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to incorporate the substance of the Notice of the Chairman of
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences of August 10, 1990, published as ``Interferences_Preliminary Motions
for Judgment,'' 1118 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 19 (Sept. 11, 1990). Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would state
that where a party files a preliminary motion for judgment against an opponent under &sect;1.633(a) based on unpatentability
over prior art having a date that appears to make the prior art equally applicable to the moving party, it will be presumed,
without regard to the dates alleged in the preliminary statement of the party, that the cited prior art is also applicable
to the party unless there is included with the motion an explanation, and evidence if appropriate, as to why the prior
art does not apply to the party. The proposed amendment differs from the notice by providing that if the motion fails
to include a sufficient explanation or evidence, the party will not be permitted to rely on any such explanation or
evidence in response to or in any subsequent action in the interference. The notice had directed the administrative
party, a procedure which results in delaying a decision on the preliminary motion. Paragraph (a) is further proposed
to be clarified by changing ``Every'' in the second sentence to ``Each.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;1.637 sets forth the requirements for a preliminary motion to add or substitute a proposed
count. It is proposed to amend paragraph (c)(1)(v) in two respects. The first is to require a moving party to show that
the proposed count is patentable over the prior art. The second is to specify that a proposed substitute count need
only be shown to be patentably distinct from the other counts proposed to remain in the interference, since a proposed
substitute count need not be patentably distinct from the count it is to replace. Paragraph (c)(1)(vi) is proposed
to be amended to clarify that a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c)(1) need not be accompanied by a preliminary
motion for benefit under &sect;1.633(f) unless the moving party seeks benefit with respect to the proposed count.
It is also proposed to add a new paragraph (c)(1)(vii) specifying that where an opponent is accorded the benefit of
the filing date of an earlier filed application in the notice of declaration of the interference, the moving party
must show why the opponent is not also entitled to benefit of the filing date of the earlier filed application with respect
to the proposed count. Otherwise, the opponent will be presumed to be entitled to the benefit of the earlier filed application
with respect to the proposed count. The amendment would eliminate the need for an opponent to respond to a &sect;1.633(c)(1)
motion with a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(f) claiming benefit, which has the effect of delaying a decision
on the &sect;1.633(c)(1) motion.

Paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) and (iii) of &sect;1.637 are proposed to be amended for clarification. Paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)
and &sect;1.637(c)(3)(iii), which relate to &sect;1.633(f) motions for benefit, are proposed to be deleted and
reserved as unnecessary, since motions under &sect;1.633(c) (2) and (3) do not efect the count. Paragraph (c)(3)(ii),
which applies to motions under &sect;1.633(c)(3) to designate a claim as corresponding to a count, is proposed to
be amended to have claims compared to claims, as is the case in &sect;1.633(c)(4)(ii), which applies to motions filed
under &sect;1.633(c)(4) to designate a claim as not corresponding to a count. The proposed amendment avoids the need
to compare claims to counts, which are subject to different rules of construction than are claims.

Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of &sect;1.637 is proposed to be amended to require that a party moving to designate a claim as
not corresponding to a count must show that the claim could not serve as the basis for a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c)(1)
to add a new count. The proposed amendment, if adopted, would preclude a party from moving to designate one of its claims
as not corresponding to the count where an opponent's disclosure would support a similar claim, in which case the party
could file a &sect;1.633(c)(1) preliminary motion proposing a claim to be added to the opponent's application and
suggesting that the proposed claim and the party's claim in question be designated as corresponding to a proposed
new count.

do not affect the count. Paragraphs (e)(1)(viii) and (e)(2)(vii) are proposed to be amended to make it clear that a
preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(e) (1) or (2) need not be accompanied by a preliminary motion for benefit under
&sect;1.633(f) unless the moving party seeks benefit with respect to the proposed count. Paragraphs (e)(1)(ix)
and (e)(2)(viii) are proposed to be added to specify that where an opponent is accorded the benefit of the filing date
of an earlier filed application in the notice of declaration of the interference, the moving party must show why the
opponent is not entitled to benefit of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed count; otherwise,
the opponent will be presumed to be entitled to benefit of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed
count. Paragraph (f)(2) of &sect;1.637 is proposed to be amended to change ``abroad'' to ``in a foreign country''
and to delete both occurrences of ``filed abroad'' as superfluous.

Paragraph (h) of &sect;1.637 is proposed to be amended to explain that a preliminary motion to add a reissue application
that includes a new or amended claim to be designated as not corresponding to a count will be given the same treatment
as a preliminary motion proposing to amend a claim in, or add a new claim to, an involved application to be designated
as not corresponding to the count, i.e., the preliminary motion will be dismissed. See L'Esperance v. Nishimoto,
18 USPQ2d 1534, 1537 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1991) (interference rules do not authorize a motion by party-applicant
to amend or add a claim to be designated as not corresponding to the count).

In &sect;1.640, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) in several respects. The first is to provide that a decision on
a preliminary motion shall be deferred to final hearing unless an administrative patent judge or the Board is of the
opinion that a decision on a preliminary motion will materially advance the resolution of the interference. The second
is to state that a matter raised by a party in support of or in opposition to a motion that is deferred to final hearing
will not be entitled to consideration at final hearing unless the matter is raised in the party's brief at final hearing.
It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) to state that where the administrative patent judge determines that the
interference shall proceed to final hearing on the issue of priority or derivation, a time shall be set for each party
to file a paper identifying any decisions of the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed
at final hearing as well as identifying any deferred or belatedly filed motions that the party wishes to have considered
at final hearing. Paragraph (b) as proposed to be amended would also require that any evidence a party wishes to have
considered with respect to the decisions and motions to be considered or reviewed at final hearing, including any
affidavits filed by the party under &sect;1.608(b) or 1.639(b), would have to be served on the opponent during the
testimony-in-chief period of the party.

not be considered except as provided by &sect;1.655(b), is proposed to be amended to state that a preliminary motion
filed after the time expires for filing preliminary motions will not be considered except as provided by &sect;1.645(b)

Paragraph (c) of &sect;1.640, which currently requires an administrative patent judge or the Board to specifically
authorize an opposition to a request for reconsideration of a decision by an administrative patent judge, is proposed
to be amended to authorize an opponent to file an opposition, thereby saving the administrative patent judge or the
Board the time it would otherwise take to determine whether an opposition should be authorized. If adopted, the administrative
patent judge would continue to have the authority to deny a request for reconsideration without waiting for an opposition.
In order to conserve the resources of the Board, it is also proposed to delete the last sentence of &sect;1.640(c) so
as to authorize a single individual administrative patent judge to decide a request for reconsideration. Paragraph
(c) is also proposed to be amended to require that a request for reconsideration be filed by hand or Express Mail. Paragraph
(d)(1), which currently states that an order to show cause under that section can be based on a decision on a motion which
is dispositive of the interference against a party as to any count, is proposed to be amended to include decisions on
dispositive matters raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge.

Paragraph (e) of &sect;1.640 is proposed to be amended to incorporate the substance of the Deputy Commissioner's
Notice of December 8, 1986, published as Interference Practice: Response to Order to Show Cause Under 37 CFR 1.640,''
1074 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 4 (Jan. 6, 1987), reprinted in 1086 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 282 (Jan. 5, 1988). Specifically,
paragraph (e) as proposed to be amended would provide that where the order to show cause was issued under &sect;1.640(d)(1),
the party may respond with a paper (i) requesting that final hearing be set to review the decision which is the basis
for the order and identifying every other decision of the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have
reviewed by the Board at a final hearing, or (ii) fully explaining why judgment should not be entered. Any other party
would be permitted to file a response to the paper within 20 days of the date of service of the paper. Where the order was
issued under &sect;1.640(d)(1) and the paper includes a request for final hearing, the response must identify every
decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final
hearing. Where the order was issued under &sect;1.640(d)(1) and the paper does not include a request for final hearing,
the response may include a request for final hearing, which must identify every decision of the administrative patent
judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. Where only the response includes
a request for a final hearing, the party who filed the paper would have 14 days from the date of service of the response
in which to file a supplemental paper identifying any other decision of the administrative patent judge that the party
wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. The paper or the response thereto would have to be accompanied
by a motion (&sect;1.635) requesting a testimony period if a party wishes to introduce any evidence to be considered
at final hearing (&sect;1.671), such as affidavits previously filed under &sect;1.639(b). A request for a testimony
period would be construed as including a request for final hearing. Where the paper contains an explanation of why
judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order and no party has requested a final hearing, the decision
that is the basis for the order would be reviewed based on the contents of the paper and the response. If the paper fails
to show good cause, the Board would enter judgment against the party against whom the order issued.

Section 1.641 currently indicates that an administrative patent judge who, during the pendency of an interference,
becomes aware of a reason why a claim designated to correspond to a count may not be patentable should notify the parties
of the reason and set a time within which each party may present its views, which the administrative patent judge will
consider in determining how the interference shall proceed. It is proposed to amend &sect;1.641 to indicate that
a party's views may include argument or appropriate preliminary motions under &sect;1.633(c), (d) and (h), including
any supporting evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.643, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) for clarification and also to change ``ends of justice'' to ``interest
of justice'' to be consistent with the language used in other interference rules, including &sect;&sect;1.628(a)
and 1.687(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.644, it is proposed to simplify paragraph (a) by changing ``a panel consisting of more than one examiner-in-chief''
to ``the Board.'' Paragraphs (a)(1), (b) and (c) are proposed to be amended by changing both occurrences of ``panel''
to ``Board.'' Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) are proposed to be changed to provide that a petition seeking to invoke the
supervisory authority of the Commissioner shall not be filed prior to the party's brief for final hearing; these paragraphs
currently provide that such a petition shall not be filed prior to a decision of the Board awarding judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph (b) of &sect;1.644 is proposed to be clarified by amending it to state that a petition under &sect;1.644(a)
shall be considered timely if it is made as part of, or simultaneously with, a proper motion under &sect;1.633, 1.634,
or 1.635 when granting the motion would require waiver of a rule. In other words, a petition under &sect;1.644(a)(2)
must seek waiver of a rule prospectively rather than retroactively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragragh (d) of &sect;1.644 is proposed to be amended to provide that the statement of facts in a petition preferably
should be in numbered paragraphs and also to delete the second sentence as unnecessary. Paragraph (f) is proposed
to be amended to change the ``15 days'' in which to request reconsideration of a decision by the Commissioner to ``14
days.'' In paragraph (g), it is proposed to delete the quotation marks around ``Express Mail.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.645, which in its current form permits consideration of a belatedly filed paper only if accompanied by a
motion under &sect;1.635 which shows sufficient cause (&sect;1.645(b)) why the paper was not timely filed, is proposed
to be amended in several respects. First, it is proposed to change ``sufficient cause'' to ``good cause'' in order
to use a single ``cause'' standard throughout the interference rules. Second, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b)
to permit consideration of a belatedly filed paper if an administrative patent judge or the Board, sua sponte, is of
the opinion that it would be in the interest of justice to consider the paper. An example would be where the delay is short
(e.g., one day) and there is no prejudice to an opponent. For purposes of the sections other than &sect;1.645, a belatedly
filed paper is considered ``timely filed'' if accompanied by a motion under &sect;1.635 which is granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;1.645 is proposed to be amended by deleting ``In an appropriate circumstance'' as superfluous
in view of the language ``may stay proceedings,'' which indicates that the administrative patent judge has the discretion
to stay an interference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.646, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(2) by deleting the reference to &sect;1.684, which is proposed
to be deleted. It is proposed to amend paragraph (c)(1) by inserting ``or causing a copy of the paper to be handed'' after
``By handing a copy of the paper'' to make it clear that the paper need not be personally delivered by the party, i.e.,
that delivery by hand can be effected by a commercial courier, for example. In paragraph (c)(4), it is proposed to change
``mail'' (second occurrence) to ``first class mail'' to make it clear that the service date specified in that paragraph
applies only to first class mail. It is also proposed to redesignate paragraph (c)(5) as paragraph (c)(6) and to add
a new paragraph (c)(5) which clarifies that a party may serve by Express Mail and that when service is effected by Express
Mail, the date of service is considered to be the date of deposit with the U.S. Postal Service. Paragraph (d) is proposed
to be amended to delete the quotation marks around ``Express Mail.'' Paragraph (e) is proposed to be amended to state
that the due date for serving a paper is the same as the due date for filing the paper in the Patent and Trademark Office.

In &sect;1.651, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(2) by deleting ``(testimony includes testimony to be taken

and (c)(3) are proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed amendment to the definition of ``effective
filing date'' in &sect;1.601(g). In paragraph (d), it is proposed to change ``abroad under &sect;1.684'' to ``in
a foreign country.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.653, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) in several ways. The first is to change the references to paragraphs
of &sect;1.672 to be consistent with the proposed redesignation of certain paragraphs of &sect;1.672, discussed
below. The second is to delete ``of fact'' in the clause ``agreed statements of fact under &sect;1.672(f)'' (proposed
to be redesignated as &sect;1.672(h)), because agreed statements under &sect;1.672(f) can set forth either (1)
how a particular witness would testify if called or (2) the facts in the case of one or more of the parties. The third is
to delete ``under &sect;1.684(c),'' since &sect;1.684 is proposed to be deleted. A fourth proposed amendment to
&sect;1.653(a) is to indicate that in addition to the types of testimony already set forth in paragraph (a), testimony
includes copies of written interrogatories and answers and written requests for admissions and answers, which might
be obtained where a motion for additional discovery under &sect;1.687(c) is granted.

Paragraph (b) of &sect;1.653 is proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed redesignation of certain
paragraphs of &sect;1.672, to delete the reference to &sect;1.684(c), which is proposed to be cancelled, and for
clarity. Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of &sect;1.653 are proposed to be amended to make it clear that the only testimony
to be included in a party's record is testimony submitted on behalf of the party. Having copies of the same testimony
appear in both parties' records unnecessarily encumbers the records and is confusing in that a given page of testimony
will have different page numbers in the different records, with the result that the briefs of the parties will refer
to different record pages for the same testimony.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that paragraph (c)(5) of &sect;1.653 be deleted and reserved. Paragraph (c)(5) currently requires
that the record filed by each party include each notice, official record and printed publication relied upon by the
party and filed under &sect;1.682(a). This requirement is considered unnecessary because such notices, official
records and printed publications are in the nature of exhibits under &sect;1.653(i), which are submitted with but
not included in the record. The inclusion of exhibits in the record merely increases the size of the record without
serving any useful purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g) of &sect;1.653 is proposed to be amended and paragraphs (f) and (h) deleted and reserved to eliminate
the current distinction between typewritten and printed records. Paragraph (g) is also proposed to be amended to
change ``81/2 x 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to ``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2 x 11 inches)'' and to delete the requirement
for justified margins and to require that the records be bound with covers at their left edges in such manner as to lie
flat when open to any page and in one or more volumes of convenient size (approximately 100 pages per volume is suggested)
and that when there is more than one volume, the numbers of the pages contained in each volume must appear at the top of
the cover for each volume. Paragraph (i) is proposed to be amended to state that exhibits include documents and things
identified in affidavits or on the record during the taking of oral depositions as well as official records and publications
submitted pursuant to &sect;1.682(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.654, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``shall'' in the second sentence to ``may'' for clarity
and also to reduce the time for oral argument by a party from 60 minutes to 30 minutes, because most hearings have required
no more than 30 minutes per side and a panel has the discretion to grant more time at the hearing, where necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.655, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing the standard of review from ``erroneous or an abuse
of discretion'' to ``an abuse of discretion.'' The recitation of a separate ``error'' standard is unnecessary, because
an abuse of discretion may be found when (1) the decision of an administrative patent judge is clearly unreasonable,
arbitrary or fanciful, (2) the decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law, (3) the findings of the administrative
patent judge are clearly erroneous, or (4) the record contains no evidence upon which the administrative patent judge
rationally could have based the decision. See,

It is proposed to amend paragraph (b) of &sect;1.655 to clarify which matters a party is not entitled to raise for consideration
at final hearing. As proposed to be amended, paragraph (b) would provide that a party shall not be entitled to raise
for consideration at final hearing a matter which properly could have been raised by a motion under &sect;1.633 or
1.634 unless (1) the matter was properly raised in a motion that was timely filed by the party under &sect;1.633 or 1.634
and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing, (2) the matter was properly raised by the party in a timely filed
opposition to a motion under &sect;1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was granted over the opposition or deferred to final
hearing, or (3) the party shows good cause why the issue was not properly raised by a timely filed motion or opposition.
It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) of &sect;1.655 to state that a change of attorneys during the interference
generally does not constitute good cause for failing to file a timely motion or opposition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993), to amend paragraph (b) of &sect;1.655 by adding a sentence explaining
that a party who fails to contest, by way of a timely filed preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c), the designation
of a claim as corresponding to a count may not subsequently argue the separate patentability or the lack of separate
patentability of claims designated as corresponding to the count. The Patent and Trademark Office conducts interference
proceedings to determine who, as between two or more applicants for patent or one or more applicants for patent and
one or more patentees, is the first inventor of a patentable invention. A primary examiner determines in the first
instance whether the claims in a pending application interfere with the claims in another pending application or
unexpired patent. When the examiner is of the view that an interference exists, the Board is notified (&sect;1.609).
The interference is assigned to an administrative patent judge (&sect;1.610), who issues a notice declaring the
interference (&sect;1.611). Each separately patentable invention involved in the interference is defined by a
count, which is merely a vehicle for contesting priority of invention (i.e, who made the invention defined by the count
first) and determining the evidence relevant to the issue of priority. A preliminary determination is made by the
Patent and Trademark Office as to which claims should be designated to correspond to the count. The claims that are
initially determined to define the same patentable invention are designated as corresponding to the count. All other
claims are designated as not corresponding to the count. The designation of claims provides a starting point in an
interference. There is a presumption that the designation of a claim as corresponding or as not corresponding to a
count is correct.

The interference rules authorize a party to file a preliminary motion to redefine an interference by designating
a claim as corresponding (&sect;1.633(c)(3)) or not corresponding (&sect;1.633(c)(4)) to a count. Prior to Van
Geuns, the Patent and Trademark Office interpreted the interference rules as requiring a party to file a preliminary
motion under &sect;1.633(c)(4) to designate a claim as not corresponding to the count as a condition for arguing at
final hearing that a claim designated as corresponding to the count is patentably distinct from another claim designated
as corresponding to the count.

identifying every party represented by the attorney in the interference and the real party in interest if the party
named in the caption is not the real party in interest and (2) a statement or related cases indicating whether the interference
was previously before the Board for final hearing and identifying any related appeal or interference which is pending
before, or which has been decided by, the Board, or which is pending before, or which has been decided by, the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a district court in a proceeding under 35 U.S.C. 146. A related appeal or interference
is one which will directly affect or be directly affected by or have a bearing on the Board's decision in the pending
interference. Appeals are mentioned because related issues may be present before the board simultaneously in an
ex parte appeal and an interference. It is also proposed to amend current paragraph (b)(3) (proposed to be redesignated
as paragraph (b)(5)) to specify that statements of fact preferably should be presented in numbered paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current paragraph (b)(4) of &sect;1.656 (proposed to be redesignated as paragraph (b)(6)) requires that the opening
brief of the junior party contain the contentions of the party with respect to the ``issues to be decided,'' which has
been construed to include the matter of whether some of the senior party's evidence of conception was inadmissible
hearsay. Suh v. Hoefle, 23 USPQ2d 1321, 1323 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1991). As support, the Board relied on Fisher
v. Bouzard, 3 USPQ2d 1677 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1987), and Moller v. Harding, 214 USPQ 730 (Bd. Pat. Int. 1982). Both
of these cases concern interferences declared under the ``old'' interference rules (i.e., &sect;1.201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of which &sect;1.254 specified that the opening brief of the junior party shall ``present a full, fair statement
of the questions involved, including his position with respect to the priority evidence on behalf of other parties.''
Current &sect;1.656(b)(4) does not expressly require, and was not intended to imply, that the opening brief of the
junior party must address the evidence of any other party with respect to the issue of priority or any other issue. In
order to clarify that the opening brief of a junior party need not address the evidence of the other parties, it is proposed
to amend current paragraph (b)(4) to require that the junior party's opening brief contain the contentions of the
party ``with respect to the issues it is raising for consideration at final hearing.'' These issues would include
the junior party's case-in-chief for priority with respect to an opponent or derivation by an opponent as well as matters
raised in any denied or deferred motions of the junior party that are to be reviewed or considered at final hearing.
Where the reply brief of the union party includes a new argument in response the case-in-chief of the senior party as
presented in the senior party's opening brief, the senior party may move under &sect;1.635 for leave to file a reply
to the junior party's reply brief, which motion must be accompanied by a copy of the senior party's reply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;1.656 is proposed to be amended to state that unless ordered otherwise by an administrative
patent judge, briefs shall be double-spaced (except for footnotes, which may be single-spaced) and shall comply
with the requirements of &sect;1.653(g) for records except the requirement for binding. As a result, the current
distinction between printed and typewritten briefs would be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (e), (g) and (h) of &sect;1.656 are proposed to be amended to require an original and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
four
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 copies (currently an original and three copies are required) of each brief, any proposed findings of fact and conclusions
of law, any motion under 37 CFR 1.635 to suppress evidence and any opposition to a motion to suppress evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g) of &sect;1.656, which permits a party to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, is further
proposed to be amended to require paragraph numbers for the findings of fact and conclusions of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) is further proposed to be amended to state that a party's failure to challenge the admissibility of the
evidence of an opponent on a ground that could have been raised in a timely objection under &sect;&sect;1.672(c),
1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) constitutes a waiver of the right to move under &sect;1.656(h) to suppress the evidence
on that ground at final hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i) of &sect;1.656 currently provides that if a junior party fails to file an opening brief for final hearing,
an order may be issued by the administrative patent judge requiring the junior party to show cause why the failure to
file a brief should not be treated as a concession of priority and further provides that judgment may be rendered against
the junior party if the junior party ``fails to respond'' within a time period set in the order. The expression ``fails
to respond'' has been misinterpreted by some junior parties as meaning that the mere filing of a response of any kind
to the order to show cause should be sufficient to avoid the entry of judgment. Such an interpretation was not intended
and if adopted would effectively negate &sect;1.656(i). The term ``respond'' is proposed to be changed to ``show
good cause'' in order to make it clear that a junior party's failure to file a timely opening brief will not be excused
unless good cause is shown to explain or justify the failure to file a brief. The language of the rule will then be consistent
with the other interference rules concerning orders to show cause, e.g., &sect;&sect;1.640(c) and 1.652.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.657 is proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed changes to the definition of ``effective
filing date'' in &sect;1.601(g) to state that in an interference involving an application and a patent where the effective
filing date of the application is after the date the patent issued, a junior party has the burden of establishing priority
by clear and convincing evidence, and that in other interferences the junior party has the burden of establishing
priority by a preponderance of the evidence. The proposed amendment would codify the holding of Price v. Symsek, 988
F.2d 1187, 19990&hyph;91, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1993), as clarified by Bosies v. Benedict, 27 F.3d 539, 541&hyph;42,
30 USPQ2d 1862, 1864 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.658, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to state that when the Board enters a decision awarding judgment
as to all counts, the decision shall be regarded as a final decision for the purpose of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141&hyph;144,
146) unless a request for reconsideration under paragraph (b) of this section is timely filed. In paragraph (b), third
sentence, it is proposed to delete the phrases ``[w]here reasonably possible'' and ``such that delivery is accomplished''
as unnecessary and to add a sentence specifying that a decision on reconsideration is a final decision for the purpose
of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141&hyph;144, 146). It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) by changing ``reply to
a request for reconsideration'' to be consistent with the terminology employed in &sect;1.640(c) regarding requests
for reconsideration of decisions on preliminary motions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.660 is proposed to be amended by adding a new paragraph (e) explaining that the failure of a party to comply
with the notice provisions of &sect;1.660 may result in sanctions under &sect;1.616, that knowledge by, or notice
to, an employee of the Office other than an employee of the Board, of the existence of the reexamination, application
for reissue, protest, or litigation shall not be sufficient, and that the notice contemplated by this section is notice
addressed specifically to an administrative patent judge or the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.662, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``filing by an applicant or patentee'' in the second
sentence to ``filing by a party'' to make it clear that the terminal disclaimer can be signed by the party's attorney
or agent of record. For the same reason, it is proposed to change ``by an applicant'' to ``by a party'' in the third sentence
of paragraph (a), which concerns abandonment of an involved application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (b) of &sect;1.662, the first sentence is proposed to be amended to change ``omits all claims of the patent
corresponding to the counts of the interference for the purpose of avoiding the interference'' to ``does not include
a claim that corresponds to a count'' in order to make it clear that judgment may not be entered where the reissue application
includes a new or amended claim that should be designated as corresponding to a count, even if the patentee argues that
it should be designated as not corresponding to a count. Similarly, it is proposed to change ``reissue other than for
the purpose of avoiding the interference'' to ``reissue which includes a claim that corresponds to a count.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.671, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from another interference, proceeding, or action filed &sect;1.683'' to ``

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from another interference, proceeding, or action filed under &sect;1.683'' in order to be consistent with the terminology
of &sect;1.683. It is proposed to amend paragraphs (c)(6) and (c)(7) of &sect;1.671 to change ``by oral deposition
or affidavit'' to ``by affidavit or oral deposition.'' Paragraph (f) is proposed to be amended to clarify that the
requirement for the significance of documentary and other exhibits to be discussed with particularity by a witness
applies only to documentary and other exhibits identified by a witness in an affidavit or during oral deposition.
Paragraph (f) does not apply to official records and printed publications submitted into evidence pursuant to &sect;1.682(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.672, in addition to the proposed amendments discussed above under the heading ``Amendments responsive
to adoption of Public Law 103&hyph;182,'' it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) by deleting the third sentence, which
specifies the type of paper to be used for affidavits, as being superfluous in view of &sect;1.677(a). In paragraph
(d), it is proposed to delete the fifth sentence (``A party electing to present testimony of a witness by deposition
shall notice a deposition of the witness under &sect;1.673(a).'') as superfluous in view of the second sentence of
&sect;1.672(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;1.673, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) by changing the time for service of evidence to be relied on at
an oral deposition from ``at least three days'' prior to the conference required by &sect;1.673(g) when service is
by hand or by Express Mail to ``at least three working days'' prior to the conference. It is also proposed to amend paragraph
(b) to change the time for service by any other means from 10 days to 14 days prior to the conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed to amend paragraph (d) of &sect;1.673 by deleting the second sentence as unnecessary, since all depositions
for a case-in-chief would have to be approved by an administrative patent judge. It is also proposed to delete the quotation
marks around ``Express Mail'' in paragraph (b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in &sect;1.673, it is proposed to clarify paragraph (e) by changing ``party electing to present testimony by
affidavit'' to ``party who has presented testimony by affidavit.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (a) of &sect;1.674, which specifies before whom depositions may be taken, it is proposed to delete the
reference to ``United States or a territory or insular possession of the United States'' in order to make this paragraph
applicable to depositions for testimony compelled in foreign countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.675, it is proposed to amend paragraph (d), which concerns reading and signing of a transcript by the witness,
to take into account that the witness might refuse to read and/or sign the transcript of the deposition, in which case
the circumstances under which the witness refused to sign must be noted on the certificate by the officer who prepared
the certified transcript (&sect;1.676(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.676, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(4) by changing ``opposing party'' to ``opponent.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.677, which in its current form specifies the required form for transcripts of depositions, is proposed
to be amended to also apply to affidavits. Furthermore, it is proposed to delete the reference to ``typewritten''
matter, to change ``pica-type'' to ``11 point type'' and to change ``81/2 &times; 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to
``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2 &times; 11 inches).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.678, it is proposed to change the section heading from ``Transcript of deposition must be filed'' to ``Time
for filing transcript of deposition'' for clarity and to amend the text by changing the time for filing the certified
transcript from 45 days to 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.679, it is proposed to change ``transcript'' to ``transcript of a deposition'' for clarity and also to
delete ``for printing (&sect;1.653(g))'' as unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1.682, in addition to the proposed amendments discussed above under the heading ``service of a `developing
record,''' it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``identified during the taking of testimony of a witness''
to ``identified in an affidavit or on the record during an oral deposition of a witness'' for clarity. It is also proposed
to delete and reserve paragraph (a)(4) (``where appropriate, be accompanied by a certified copy of the official record
or a copy of the printed publication (&sect;1.671(d))'') as superfluous in view of Rules 901 and 902 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence, which apply to interference proceedings (&sect;1.671(b)) and require authentication of evidence
that is not self-authenticating. Finally, it is proposed to capitalize the first word in each of paragraphs (a)(2),
(a)(3) and (a)(4).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these proposed rules are not significant for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel
for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the changes
clarify existing rules setting forth the procedures used in patent appeals and interferences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

A count should be broad enough to encompass the broadest corresponding patentable claim of each of the parties. A count
may not be so broad as to be unpatentable over the prior art.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 When there is more than one count, each count shall define a separate patentable invention. Any claim of an application

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0023 unknown -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Before an interference is declared between an application and an unexpired patent, an examiner must determine that
there is interfering subject matter claimed in the application and the patent which is patentable to the applicant
subject to a judgment in the interference. The interfering subject matter will be defined by one or more counts. 
<!-- PJG 0023 unknown -->
Each count shall define a separate patentable invention.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All claims in the application and patent which define the same patentable invention as a count shall be designated
to correspond to the count. At the time an interference is initially declared (&sect;1.611), a count shall not be narrower
in scope than any patent claim which corresponds to the count and any single patent claim will be presumed. subject
to a motion under &sect;1.633(c), not to contain separate patentable inventions.

If a party files a motion for judgment under &sect;1.633(a) against an opponent based on the ground of unpatentability
over prior art, and the dates of the cited prior art are such that the prior art appears to be applicable to the party,
it will be presumed, without regard to the dates alleged in the preliminary statement of the party, that the cited prior
art is applicable to the party unless there is included with the motion an explanation, and evidence if appropriate,
as to why the prior art does not apply to the party. If the motion fails to include a sufficient explanation or evidence,
the party will not be permitted to rely on any such explanation or evidence in response to or in any subsequent action
in the interference.

(1) If the order was issued under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the paper may (i) request that final hearing be set
to review any decision which is the basis for the order as well as any other decision of the administrative patent judge
that the party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at final hearing, or (ii) fully explain why judgment should not be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the order was issued under paragraph (d)(10 of this section and the paper includes a request for final hearing, the
response must identify every decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have
reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. If the order was issued under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the paper
does not include a request for final hearing, the response may include a request for final hearing, which must identify
every decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at
a final hearing. Where only the response includes a request for a final hearing, the party that filed the paper has 14
days from the date of service of the response in which to file a supplemental paper identifying any other decision of
the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The paper or the response thereto should be accompanied by a motion (&sect;1.635) requesting a testimony period
if a party wishes to introduce any evidence to be considered at final hearing (&sect;1.671). A request for a testimony
period shall be construed as including a request for final hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the paper contains an explanation of why judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order and no party
has requested a final hearing, the decision that is the basis for the order shall be reviewed based on the contents of
the paper and the response. If the paper fails to show good cause, the Board shall enter judgment against the party against
whom the order issued.

(a) Except to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or for
commencing a civil action, a party may file a motion (&sect;1.635) seeking an extension of time to take action in an
interference. See &sect;1.304(a) for extensions of time for filing a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit or for commencing a civil action. The motion shall be filed within sufficient time to actually
reach the

if there is no objection by any other party. The motion will be denied unless the moving party shows good cause why an
extension should be granted. The press of other business arising after an

 sets a time for taking action will not normally constitute good cause. A motion seeking additional time to take testimony
because a party has not been able to procure the testimony of a witness shall set forth the name of the witness, any steps
taken to procure the testimony of the witness, the dates on which the steps were taken, and the facts expected to be proved
through the witness.

51. Section 1.655 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;1.655 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Matters considered in rendering a final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In rendering a final decision, the Board may consider any properly raised issue including (1) priority of invention,
(2) derivation by an opponent from a party who filed a preliminary statement under &sect;1.625, (3) patentability
of the invention, (4) admissibility of evidence, (5) any interlocutory matter deferred to final hearing, and (6)
any other matter necessary to resolve the interference. The Board may also consider whether 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->
&gt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
entry of
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 any interlocutory order was 
<!-- PJG 0023 unknown -->
erroneous or
<!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->
 an abuse of discretion. All interlocutory orders shall be presumed to have been correct and the burden of showing 
<!-- PJG 0023 unknown -->
error or
<!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->
 an abuse of discretion shall be on the party attacking the order. When two or more interlocutory orders involve the
same issue, the last entered order shall be presumed to have been correct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A party shall not be entitled to raise for consideration at final hearing a matter which properly could have been
raised by a motion under &sect;&sect;1.633 or 1.634 unless (1) the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->

&gt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by the party under &sect;&sect;1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, (2) the matter was properly raised by 
<!-- PJG 0023 unknown -->
a
<!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->
&gt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A change of attorneys during the interference generally does not constitute good cause. A party who fails to contest,
by way of a timely filed preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c), the designation of a claim as corresponding to a
count may not subsequently argue to an administrative patent judge or the Board the separate patentability or lack
of separate patentability of claims designated to correspond to the count.

the laws of the foreign country where the testimony is taken and (2) that the punishment in a foreign country for giving
such false testimony is similar to the punishment for perjury committed in the United States.

An opponent that fails to challenge the admissibility of the evidence contained in or submitted with an affidavit
on a ground that could have been raised in a timely objection under this paragraph will not be entitled to move under
&sect;1.656(h) to suppress the evidence on that ground. If an opponent timely files objections, the party may, within
20 days of the due date for filing objections, file supplemental affidavits and supplemental official records and
printed publications to overcome the objections. No objection to the admissibility of the supplemental evidence
shall be made, except as provided by &sect;1.656(h). The pages of supplemental affidavits filed under this paragraph
shall be sequentially numbered beginning with the number following the last page number of the party's testimony
submitted under paragraph (b) of this section. The page numbers assigned to the supplemental affidavits shall also
serve as the record page numbers for the supplemental affidavits in the party's record filed under &sect;1.653. Additional
exhibits identified in supplemental affidavits and any supplemental official records and printed publications
shall be given sequential numbers beginning with the number following the last number of the exhibits submitted under
paragraph (b) of this section. The exhibit numbers shall also serve as the exhibit numbers when the exhibits are filed

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) amendment submitted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The intent of the SIP amendment is to effect a decrease in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and motor vehicle emissions
by controlling the growth of parking spaces in the South Boston neighborhood of Boston and holding automobile usage
to levels within the practical capacity of the local street network. Vehicular emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons
and nitrogen oxides will be reduced compared with their expected levels if parking is not constrained. These pollutants
contribute to the carbon monoxide and ozone air pollution problems in the Boston urbanized area. This SIP revision
adds the South Boston Parking Freeze Area to ongoing parking management plans in the Metropolitan Boston Area. The
intended effect of this action is to propose approval of the changes to Massachusetts' SIP. This action is being taken
under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 30, 1993, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) submitted a revision to its State
Implementation Plan (SIP) for the South Boston Parking Freeze. The amendment adds or revises four definitions to
310 CMR 7.00 and adds a new section, 310 CMR 7.33 ``MB City of Boston/South Boston Parking Freeze'' to manage the overall
parking demand in South Boston. Specifically, the measure will constrain future parking supply at 10 percent above
1990 levels, allowing for an increase in the supply to accommodate an expected increase in demand accompanying intensive
development in South Boston. A second ten percent increase in parking supply will be permitted in the South Boston
Piers area when the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project is completed and open to the public.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parking freezes for part of the City of Boston, the City of Cambridge, and Logan Airport were included as one strategy
in the Transportation Control Plan promulgated by the EPA in its plan for the Boston Region in 1975. (See CFR part 52,
subpart W; 38 FR 17689 (July 2, 1973); 38 FR 30960 (November 8, 1973); 40 FR 25162 (June 12, 1975); 40 FR 39863 (August
29, 1975).) On September 16, 1979, EPA approved Massachusetts' 1979 SIP, which included these parking freezes. Massachusetts
reaffirmed these freezes in its 1982 SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On December 19, 1990, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation and Construction (EOTC), the Massachusetts
Department of Public Works ((MDPW), now the Massachusetts Highway Department (MA HWY)) and the Conservation Law
Foundation (CLF) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) committing the parties to pursue implementation, monitoring
and enforcement of traffic, and air quality mitigation measures for the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project.
Parking freezes, including the development and implementation of the South Boston Parking Freeze, were among the
specific measures committed to in the MOU. The Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) voted on December
27, 1990, to adopt the items of the MOU as a State Implementation Plan (SIP) provision, and forwarded the items to the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MA DEP) as a proposed amendment to the SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Metropolitan Planning Organization is the current ``State Certified Organization'' for transportation control
measures in the SIP. In response to the MPO submission, MA DEP developed regulations which were proposed in October
of 1992. MA DEP held a public hearing on these amendments on November 30, 1992. The comment period ended December 10,
1992, with oral testimony and written comments received from EPA as well as various other parties. The amendments
(as formal state regulations) were filed with Massachusetts Secretary of State on March 15, 1993, and became effective
on April 9, 1993, upon publication in the Massachusetts Register.

(1) Geographic Area.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The South Boston Parking Freeze area is divided into three zones defined as: (i) The South Boston Piers Zone; (ii) the
South Boston Industrial/Commercial Zone; and (iii) the South Boston Residential Zone. The boundaries of these zones
are defined in the state regulation as well as in EPA's Technical Support Document (TSD) available in the docket for
this action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) Definition of the Parking Freeze.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is a freeze (limit) on the availability of motor vehicle parking spaces within the South Boston Piers Zone and
the Industrial/Commercial Zone, and a freeze on the availability of remote parking spaces within the South Boston
Residential Zone.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, the South Boston Piers Zone will have ten percent of its off-street spaces set aside and allocated for
off-peak period parking. Off-peak spaces would not be used by everyday commuters but reserved for people needing
short term parking. Therefore, parking spaces designated for off-peak use may not be used between 7:30 a.m. and 9:30
a.m., but could be used at other times. Once the South Boston Transitway opens, additional spaces in the South Boston
Piers Zone will be set aside for off-peak parking, resulting in a total of 20 percent off-peak parking spaces. Finally,
a second ten percent will be created and added to the Freeze Bank for the South Boston Piers Zone when the Central Artery/Third
Harbor Tunnel opens to the public.

''Remote parking spaces'' are spaces in which the driver parks and then proceeds to his/her destination outside South
Boston, such as Downtown Boston or Logan Airport. See 310 CMR 7.00.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Massachusetts regulation requires the Boston Air Pollution Control Commission (BAPCC) and Massachusetts Port
Authority (Massport) to develop and submit an inventory of all existing motor vehicle parking spaces for each of their
respective areas. In addition, all motor vehicle parking spaces that were part of any project submitted for review
under the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) process in 301 CMR 11.00, or the Federal Environmental Review
Process in 40 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as of August 1, 1990, as well as remote parking spaces, must be identified in their respective inventories. This inventory
will identify parking spaces for commercial, remote, employee, restricted use, off-peak uses and parking spaces
eliminated during the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project construction within the freeze area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Massachusetts Regulation authorizes BAPCC to allow ``restricted use parking'' spaces in the South Boston Piers
and Industrial/Commercial zones for up to ten days each year. These spaces are designed to allow the cap to be exceeded
on a very short-term basis to accommodate unusual events. Massport is prohibited from providing restricted use parking
in South Boston.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A South Boston Parking Freeze Draft Base Inventory was developed by the BAPCC in accordance with the state regulation
and was submitted to MA DEP for review, public comment and approval. BAPCC's April 1994 Draft Base Inventory estimated
27,768 motor vehicle parking spaces within the South Boston Parking Freeze Area. This is broken down as: South Boston
Piers Zone 15,916 spaces: South Boston Industrial Zone 11,841 spaces; and South Boston Residential Zone 11 spaces.
On June 13, 1994, MA DEP found BAPCC's parking inventory inadequate and required BAPCC to resolve those inadequacies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) Establishment of Parking Freeze Banks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The number of Motor vehicle parking spaces in the South Boston Parking Freeze Area will be limited to the base inventory,
plus an initial parking freeze bank equal to 10% of the base inventory of motor vehicles parking spaces. There will
be two parking freeze banks, administered separately by the BAPCC and Massport. Motor vehicle parking spaces eliminated
from use in the South Boston Parking Freeze Area can be credited to the appropriate parking freeze bank for reallocation
and are not privately transferrable.

Goals of the Parking Freeze
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MA DEP expects that the parking freeze will ensure that economic growth in South Boston occurs efficiently with respect
to land use and transportation infrastructure and in the most environmentally beneficial way. MA DEP stated that
the South Boston Parking Freeze has been designed with the following specific objectives: to improve air quality
over forecast levels, in the metropolitan Boston area and locally, by limiting the growth in traffic congestion so
Federal health-related air quality standards can be attained as rapidly as possible; to reduce traffic on South Boston
neighborhood streets; to manage the parking supply so that transportation and land resources are used efficiently;
to build in flexibility to respond to the changes in traffic capacity resulting from the Central Artery/Third Harbor
Tunnel project; and to encourage transit as the preferred transportation access mode for all new development in the
South Boston area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Air Quality Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The South Boston Parking Freeze is designed to reduce the growth of VMT and travel-related air emissions by controlling
the growth of parking spaces serving South Boston. The freeze will result in air quality improvements beyond those
which would occur in the future without this measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the three South Boston zones, MA DEP expects the proposed freeze to reduce total future trips by 15,220 per day or
19 percent of the approximately 80,105 trips forecast with unconstrained parking. This is a 5.3 percent reduction
in the future year trips without the freeze in the Central Artery Study area, and a 0.3 percent reduction overall in
Eastern Massachusetts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without the South Boston freeze, the amount of VMT increases in the South Boston zones are large. On average in the three
South Boston zones, MA DEP expects trips to rise by about 35 percent between now and the year 2010. Based on vehicle trip
reductions and the related VMT change, a reduction of 8.06 percent in VMT is obtained below the level which would otherwise
occur with unconstrained parking within the Central Artery Study area, and 0.3 percent over the entire region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using EPA's Mobile Emission Factor Model (MOBILE4.1, the current version at the time of the MA DEP's analysis) and
the Central Artery Traffic Model, the South Boston Parking Freeze would reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) by approximately 74.86 kilograms per day by the year 2010 within the Central Artery Study area. Carbon Monoxide
emissions would be reduced by 558.50 kilograms per day within the Central Artery Study area. Using the EPA MOBILE4.1
emission Model and the Central Transportation Planning Staff (CTPS) regional transportation model, the South Boston
Parking Freeze will reduce emissions of VOCs by 269.79 kilograms per day, and of carbon monoxide (CO) by approximately
1,663.91 kilograms per day within Eastern Massachusetts. The regional model also accounts for the secondary effects
of reducing traffic, which will in turn reduce congestion and emissions elsewhere in the region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA supports the South Boston Parking Freeze Plan as a means to reduce VMT and ultimately eliminate motor vehicle emissions
associated with reduced VMT. The VMT reduction anticipated with implementing the South Boston Parking Freeze Plan
will be accounted for through Highway Performance Monitoring System's (HPMS) statistical sampling of VMT within
the Boston Metropolitan area. VMT reductions resulting from the South Boston freeze will be documented by Massachusetts
in their emission inventories and regional emission analysis (prepared for transportation conformity) and result
in improved ambient air quality. Specific emission credit associated with the South Boston Parking Freeze Plan is
not being assigned in the SIP. In addition, because Massachusetts will account for VMT and emission benefits in their
base scenario, Massachusetts' Reasonable Further Progress Plan does not identify the South Boston Parking Freeze
as an emission reduction element or as a contingency measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's review of this material indicates that the proposed SIP amendment will result in improved air quality. EPA is
proposing to approve the Massachusetts SIP revision for South Boston Parking Freeze, which was submitted on July
30, 1993. EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this proposal or on other relevant matters.
These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal
rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, (Clean Air Act (``Act'') sections 501&hyph;507),
EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and
the corresponding standards and procedures by which EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating
permits programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all
major stationary sources and to certain other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section
502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program
substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period
of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date, or by the end of an interim
program, it must establish and implement a Federal operating permits program.

Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments), the Governor of each State must develop
and submit to the Administrator an operating permits program under State or local law or under an interstate compact
meeting the requirements of title V of the Act. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) requested,
under the signature of Governor Kirk Fordice, approval of its operating permits program with full authority to administer
the program in all areas of the State of Mississippi, with the exceptions of the Indian reservations and tribal lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the MDEQ operating permits program submittal, Mississippi does not assert jurisdiction over Indian lands or reservations
for purposes of 40 CFR part 70 and title V. EPA will, at a future date, conduct a Federal title V operating permits program
governing title V sources of air emissions on Indian lands and reservations in Mississippi.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mississippi submittal, provided as Section I&hyph;''Program Description and Implementation Summary,'' addresses
40 CFR 70.4(b)(1) by describing how the MDEQ intends to carry out its responsibilities under the part 70 regulations.
The program description has been deemed to be sufficient for meeting the requirement of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(1).

Pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3), the Governor is required to submit a legal opinion from the Attorney General (or the
attorney for the State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate
authority to carry out all aspects of a title V operating permits program. The State of Mississippi submitted an Attorney
General's Opinion and a Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion demonstrating adequate legal authority as required
by Federal law and regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the regulations,
such as permit application forms, permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its
permit program. Appendix 10 of the MDEQ submittal includes the permit application form, and it has been determined
that the application form meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.5(c).

2. Regulations and Program Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Mississippi has submitted Regulations APC-S&hyph;6, ``Mississippi Air Emissions Operating Permit
Regulations for the purposes of title V of the Federal Clean Air Act,'' for implementing the State part 70 program as
required by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption was included in Appendices
7 and 12 of the submittal. Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations which authorize the part 70 program,
including those governing State administrative procedures, were submitted with the State's program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mississippi operating permits regulations followed part 70 very closely. The following requirements, set out
in EPA's part 70 operating permits program review, are addressed in Section II of the State's submittal: (A) Applicability
requirements, (40 CFR 70.3(a)): APC-S&hyph;6, Section I.B; (B) Permit applications, (40 CFR 70.5): APC-S&hyph;6,
Section II; (C) Provisions for permit content, (40 CFR 70.6): standard permit requirements: APC-S&hyph;6, Section
III.A.1; permit duration: APC-S&hyph;6, Section III.A.2; monitoring and related record keeping and reporting
requirements: APC-S&hyph;6, Section III.A.3; compliance requirements: APC-S&hyph;6, Sections III.B and III.C;
(D) Operational flexibility provisions, (40 CFR 70.4(b)(12)): APC-S&hyph;6, Section IV.F; (E) Provisions for
permit issuance, renewals, reopenings and revisions, including public participation (40 CFR 70.7): APC-S&hyph;6,
Section IV; and (F) Permit review by EPA and affected States (40 CFR 70.6): APC-S&hyph;6, Section V. Mississippi Code
Annotated (MSCA) sections 49&hyph;17&hyph;36 and 49&hyph;17&hyph;43, satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 70.11,
for enforcement authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MDEQ has included criteria to determine insignificant activities and emissions levels in APC-S&hyph;6, Section
VII. Section VII.A includes activities/emissions sources which are not required to be included in the permit application.
Section VII.B includes activities/emissions sources that must be listed in the permit application, but their emissions
do not have to be quantified. Notwithstanding Sections VII.A and B, applicants are required to include all emission
sources and quantify emissions if needed to determine major source compliance with an applicable requirement, or
to collect any permit fee. Applicants shall also include all emission sources with a potential to emit greater than
1 pound per hour of any regulated air pollutant that is not a hazardous air pollutant, or greater than 0.1 pound per hour
of any hazardous air pollutant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 70 of the operating permits regulations requires prompt reporting of deviations from the permit requirements.
Section 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) requires the permitting authority to define prompt in relation to the degree and type
of deviation likely to occur and the applicable requirements. Although the permit program regulations should define
prompt for purposes of administrative efficiency and clarity, an acceptable alternative is to define prompt in each
individual permit. EPA believes that prompt should generally be defined as requiring reporting within two to ten
days of the deviation. Two to ten days is sufficient time in most cases to protect public health and safety as well as
to provide a forewarning of potential problems. For sources with a low level of excess emissions, a longer time period
may be acceptable. However, prompt reporting must be more frequent than the semiannual reporting requirement, given
that this is a distinct reporting obligation under 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). Where ``prompt'' is defined in the
individual permit but not in the program regulations, EPA may veto permits that do not require sufficiently prompt
reporting of deviations. The State of Mississippi has not defined prompt in its program regulations with respect
to reporting of deviations. The MDEQ, however, has committed to define ``prompt'' as discussed above in each individual
permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State statute (MSCA 49&hyph;2&hyph;9) contains a provision that allows the State to adopt, modify, repeal, and
promulgate, after due notice and hearing, and where not otherwise prohibited by Federal or State law, to make exceptions
to and grant exceptions and variances from, and to enforce rules and regulations implementing or effectuating the
powers and duties of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality under any and all statutes within the Commission's
jurisdiction, and as the Commission may deem necessary to prevent, control and abate existing or potential pollution.
Regulation APC-S&hyph;6, Section I.B.8 prohibits exceptions or variances to be granted from any of the regulations
regarding title V permits. The program submittal is approvable based on these limitations placed on the state's variance
provision.

3. Permit Fee Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSCA sections 49&hyph;17&hyph;14 and 49&hyph;17&hyph;30 require the establishment of a permit fee sufficient
to cover the reasonable direct and indirect costs of the title V operating permit program. The fee amount is set annually
by order of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality and is based on either actual or allowable emissions
at the request of the source. Under State law, the minimum annual fee assessment is set at $250 and the maximum annual
fee assessment is set at $250,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MDEQ has elected to assess a title V operating permit fee below the Federal presumptive minimum permit fee. Mississippi's
fee amount was determined through a detailed fee demonstration study that was conducted by the John C. Stennis Institute
of Government at Mississippi State University. The basis of the fee demonstration was a comprehensive workload analysis
for the title V program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the results of the fee demonstration study, the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality issued
an Order setting the title V fee at $23.39 per ton of regulated air pollutants for the first year of the title V program.
The fee may be adjusted annually by Order of the Commission to account for inflation factors or changing program costs.
EPA has determined that Mississippi's fee demonstration is adequate and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.9.

a. Authority and/or Commitments for Section 112 Implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mississippi has demonstrated in its title V program submittal broad legal authority to incorporate into permits
and enforce all applicable requirements. Additionally, the State has adopted APC-S&hyph;1, Section 8, ``Provisions
for Hazardous Air Pollutants,'' which provides adequate legal authority to implement and enforce applicable section
112 rules, emission standards, and requirements. Mississippi has further supplemented its broad legal authority
with a commitment to ``take action, following promulgation by EPA of regulations implementing section 112 of title
III of the Federal Clean Air Act, and to submit, for EPA approval, MDEQ regulations implementing these provisions.''
EPA has determined that this commitment, in conjunction with Mississippi's broad statutory and regulatory authority,
adequately assures compliance with all section 112 requirements. EPA regards this commitment as an acknowledgement
by Mississippi of its obligation to obtain further regulatory authority as needed to issue permits that assure compliance
with section 112 applicable requirements. This commitment does not substitute for compliance with part 70 requirements
that must be met at the time of program approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is interpreting the above legal authority and commitment to mean that Mississippi is able to carry out all section
112 activities. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying
this proposed full approval and the April 13, 1993 guidance memorandum entitled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria
for Section 112 Activities,'' signed by John Seitz.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Implementation of 112(g) Upon Program Approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Mississippi is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from
the effective date of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of MACT or offsets under section
112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable restrictions on a source-specific
basis. EPA is proposing to approve Mississippi's preconstruction permitting program found in APC-S&hyph;2 under
the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period
between title V approval and adoption of a State rule implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA believes
this approval is necessary so that Mississippi has a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions
for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval. Section 112(l) provides the authority for approval
for the use of State air programs to implement 112(g), and title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited
approval because of the direct linkage between implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval
is narrowly limited to section 112(g), and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under
the Act. If Mississippi does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and
can demonstrate that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, EPA may, in the final action approving
Mississippi's part 70 program, approve the alternative instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval only extends until such time as the State is able to adopt regulations consistent with any regulations
promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval
to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Mississippi, acting expeditiously,
will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. EPA is proposing here to limit the
duration of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations.

c. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval
of a program for delegation of section 112 General Provisions Subpart A and standards as promulgated by EPA as they
apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate
resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70.
Therefore, EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program
for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated,
and to delegate existing standards under 40 CFR parts 61 and 63 for part 70 sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The radionuclide National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant (NESHAP) is a section 112 regulation and
therefore, also an applicable requirement under the State operating permits program for part 70 sources. There is
not yet a Federal definition of ``major'' for radionuclide sources. Therefore, until a major source definition for
radionuclide is promulgated, no source would be a major section 112 source solely due to its radionuclide emissions.
However, a radionuclide source may, in the interim, be a major source under part 70 for another reason, thus requiring
a part 70 permit. The EPA will work with the State in the development of its radionuclide program to ensure that permits
are issued in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, Mississippi has requested delegation of current and future section 112 standards under section 112(l)(5)
and 40 CFR 63.91 for sources not subject to part 70 requirements. The State has demonstrated that it has broad legal
authority which covers all section 112 sources. MSCA sections 49&hyph;2&hyph;9 and 49&hyph;17&hyph;29(a), and
APC-S&hyph;1 section 8, give the State the authority to implement each applicable section 112 rule, emission standard,
or requirement for sources not subject to part 70 requirements. Mississippi has demonstrated that it will expeditiously
implement section 112 requirements for these sources pursuant to a schedule after EPA promulgation, and that it has
sufficient enforcement authority to adequately enforce section 112 requirements. The State has also demonstrated
that it has adequate resources to implement current section 112 standards. With respect to future section 112 requirements,
Mississippi has committed to provide EPA with future demonstrations of resource adequacy as necessary when new requirements
are promulgated and the resource burdens associated with those requirements become known. Therefore, for sources
not subject to part 70 requirements, EPA is proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of
the State's program for receiving delegation of future section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards
as promulgated, and to delegate existing standards under 40 CFR parts 61 and 63 for non-part 70 sources.

1. Full Approval of the Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to fully approve the operating permits program submitted to EPA from the State of Mississippi on November
15, 1993. As a condition of full approval, Mississippi has issued a commitment to EPA which confirms that the State's
interpretation of a ``title I modification'' is consistent with EPA's current interpretation of that term. In addition,
the State's regulatory definition is on its face consistent with EPA's interpretation. See APC-S&hyph;6, Section
I.A.31. EPA believes the better interpretation of the phrase ``modifications under any provision of title I of the
Act'' in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5) to mean literally any change at a source that would trigger permitting authority
review under regulations approved or promulgated under title I of the Act. This would include State preconstruction
review programs approved into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) under section 110(a)(2)(C) and regulations addressing
source changes that trigger National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) established pursuant
to section 112 prior to the 1990 amendments. EPA is soliciting comment in the current proposal to revise part 70 on the
proper definition of ``title I modification.'' Unless Mississippi changes its own interpretation from that indicated
in its commitment, the program will be fully approvable under either option discussed in that proposal. See 56 FR 44460,
44515 (August 29, 1994). EPA has determined that the program is otherwise adequate to meet the minimum elements of
a State operating permits program as specified in 40 CFR part 70.

As discussed above in section II.A.4.c, EPA is proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91
of the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards
as promulgated. This program for delegations applies to all section 112 sources. Additionally, EPA is proposing
to delegate existing standards under 40 CFR parts 61 and 63 for all section 112 sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) is proposing changes to its regulations in order to implement
the 1992 amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act and to improve the Section 106 process, by which Federal
agencies consider the effects of their undertakings on historic properties. The proposed changes seek to balance
the interests and concerns of various users of the Section 106 process, including Federal agencies, State Historic
Preservation Officers (SHPOs), Native Americans and Native Hawaiians, and the public. The revised regulations
also respond to the new Section 110 provisions in the 1992 amendments which require Federal agencies to establish
historic preservation programs.

Comments must be received on or before December 2, 1994. In recognition of the unique trust and treaty relationships
between the United States Government and Indian tribes, their enhanced role in the Section 106 process as directed
by the National Historic Preservation Act amendments of 1992, and the possibility that some tribes will need more
than 60 days to provide comments, the Council will provide on request an additional 30 days for an Indian tribe to submit
comments. A representative of the tribal government must file such request with the Council no later than December
2, 1994.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. &sect;470f, requires Federal
agencies to take into account the effect of their undertakings on properties included in or eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places and to afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings.
Public Law 102&hyph;575 was enacted in October, 1992, and contains amendments to the National Historic Preservation
Act which affect the way Section 106 review is carried out under the Council's regulations. Furthermore, as part of
the Administration's National Performance Review, the Council undertook a review of the current regulatory process
to identify potential changes that could improve the operation of the Section 106 process and conform it to the principles
of this Administration. The Council commenced an information-gathering effort to assess the current Section 106
process and to identify desirable changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a part of this effort, the Council sent a questionnaire to 1,200 users of the Section 106 process, including Federal
agencies, SHPOs, State and local governments, applicants for Federal assistance, Native Americans, preservation
groups, contractors involved in the process, and members of the public. The questionnaires sought opinions on the
current regulatory process and ideas for enhancing the process. The Council received over 400 responses. After analyzing
the responses and holding several meetings with Federal Preservation Officers and SHPOs, the Council staff presented
its preliminary findings to a special Council member Task Force comprised of the Department of Transportation, the
National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Native
American representative William Tallbull, expert member Jane Davidson, and Council chairman Cathryn Buford Slater.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The key findings presented to and adopted by the Regulations Task Force were the following: (1) Federal agencies and
SHPOs should be given greater authority to conclude Section 106 review; (2) the Council should spend more time monitoring
program trends and overall performance of Federal agencies and SHPOs and less time reviewing individual cases or
participating in case-specific consultation; (3) Section 106 review requirements should be integrated with environmental
review required by other statutes; (4) enforcement of Section 106 should be increased and specific remedies should
be provided for failure to comply; and (5) there should be expanded opportunities for public involvement in the Section
106 process.

II. Summary of Regulatory Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the findings adopted by the Council Regulations Task Force, the Council proposes to revise its regulations
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A_Background and Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Subpart adds a new section describing the goals of the consultation process (Section 800.1(b)) and clarifying
the roles of participants in the Section 106 process, particularly those of Native Americans and Native Hawaiians
(Section 800.1(e)) as required by the 1992 NHPA amendments. The provision regarding Native American and Native Hawaiian
participation provides detailed guidance on how Federal agency officials consult with Native American and Native
Hawaiian organizations that attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected
by an undertaking (Section 800.1(e)(5)). The section on participants in the Section 106 process also elaborates
on the role and rights of the public to participate in the process (Section 800.6(e)(6)). In order to encourage consideration
of historic properties as early in the planning stages as possible, the regulations specifically set forth a section
on timing (Section 800.6(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart A also adds new definitions and revises current definitions to conform to the 1992 NHPA amendments and to clarify
terms which have raised questions during the implementation of the Section 106 process (Section 800.2). New definitions
include: agency, anticipatory demolition, approval of the expenditure of funds, comment, conditional no adverse
effect agreement, consultation, Council membership, foreclosure, head of the agency, memorandum of agreement,
Native Hawaiian, Native Hawaiian organization, notice of violation, traditional community, and traditional cultural
authority. Revised definitions include: agency official, area of potential effects, historic property, Indian
tribe, interested (party) person, Indian (tribal) lands, and undertaking. The definition of undertaking has been
changed to accord with the intent of the statutory definition provided in the 1992 NHPA amendments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council has added new provisions to assist agencies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting their responsibilities under the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in Section 110(a)(2) of the 1992 NHPA amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which requires agencies to develop preservation programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that the agencies' procedures for compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 are consistent with the Council's procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Sections 800.3&hyph;800.6). The provisions implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principle that agency procedures establishing a preservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program must be consistent with the Council's regulations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing standards for consistency (Section 800.4) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes through which the Council can evaluate whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these standards have been met (Section 800.5 and 800.6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart C_The Section 106 Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The heart of the Section 106 process is in Subpart C. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in this Subpart have changed to allow for more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency-SHPO decisionmaking without Council involvement. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offset the Council's removal from routine cases, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart gives the Council the authority to resolve disputes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between Federal agencies and SHPOs and to monitor agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance and provides an expanded opportunity for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public to request the Council to intervene in particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 800.7(a&hyph;e) sets forth the steps that an agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official must go through prior to the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties. These provisions emphasize the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for early planning and coordination, both with reviews under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other authorities and with other individuals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, prior to the initiation of the identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage. The identification and evaluation stages (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.8) remain essentially the same as the present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, except that the regulation adds a provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing for Council review of agency decisions made during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identification and evaluation stages (Section 800.8(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a supplement to Section 800.8, a non-binding Appendix has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been added to provide additional clarification on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification process and the establishment of the area of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised regulations eliminate the determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect step (and the existing Criteria of Effect) currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Section 106 process and allow an agency to apply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria of adverse effect directly after completing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification stage (Section 800.9(a)). An agency is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer required to notify the Council of a finding of no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effect, but the Council may review such a finding if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested or if the Council deems it appropriate (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.9(d)). The revised regulations also eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to a finding of adverse effect and incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those exceptions into a new provision allowing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditional no adverse effect agreements (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.9(b)(2)). The intent of the addition of the conditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no adverse effect agreement provision is to allow agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and SHPOs flexibility in reaching routine agreements while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining agency accountability. It formally recognizes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice that has already become widespread under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to resolve adverse effects more efficiently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised regulations provide more autonomy to the SHPO and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal agency. The revised regulations establish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for resolution of adverse effects without the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's participation, changing the current two-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Memorandum of Agreement process (Sections 800.10(a)(1) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.10(c)(1)). Under this provision, if the Council elects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to participate in the negotiation, the agency and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SHPO may execute a Memorandum of Agreement which is sent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council, but need not be executed by the Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Section 800.10(c)(1)). The revised regulations also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify the use, force and effect of a Memorandum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement and its provisions (Section 800.10(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a Memorandum of Agreement cannot be reached during two-party consultation, the parties must seek the Council's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation and enter three-party consultation before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminating negotiations. If a Memorandum of Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be reached, the revised regulations set forth more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed provisions on termination of negotiations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council comments (Section 800.11)). With regard to Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the new regulations require that the head of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency respond to the Council's comments in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(l) of the NHPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In responding to comments made by respondents to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's survey of Section 106 users and in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance the Council's removal from routine Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, the revised regulations establish a new section on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency monitoring and compliance (Section 800.12). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section provides for the review of an agency official's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings, providing more detail than the review procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the current regulations at Section 800.6(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The monitoring and compliance section also includes a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision for the issuance of a notice of violation to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency which has violated or, in the case of a preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of violation, is about to violate the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NHPA. In response to the 1992 amendments which added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(k), the Council has established procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing anticipatory demolition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart D_Alternative Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Subpart provides options for complying with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Section 106 other than those set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart C. Its purpose is to encourage agencies to integrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Section 106 process into their internal planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. Section 800.16 of the revised regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explains that counterpart procedures, as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 800.4 and 800.5(a), Programmatic Agreements, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in Section 800.5(b), provide alternative means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. In accordance with Section 101(d)(5) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHPA, the Council has added a new provision to establish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process by which an Indian tribe may substitute its tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic preservation regulations for the Council's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for review of undertakings on tribal lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Section 800.17). The Council has also attempted to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unique situations created by disasters or emergencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has revised its emergency regulations to emphasize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for the development of agency counterpart procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which establish a plan for considering historic properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during responses to disasters and emergencies. The revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency regulations delete reference to 36 CFR Part 78 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to encourage agencies to develop their own procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dealing with disasters. The Council has limited the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of the regulations to natural disasters or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergencies declared by the President or by an Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart E_Coordination With Other Authorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an expansion and revision of the current regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding agency coordination, requested by surveyed users, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised regulations establish more detailed guidance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination with the National Environmental Policy Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate other relevant statutes where coordination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable (Section 800.19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Issues Deserving Special Attention From Commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the development of these revisions, the Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that several issues warranted special attention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from commenters. These issues fall into three categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) areas of particular concern to the Council on which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
views of users and the public are particularly solicited; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) provisions that could be drafted in one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative ways and views are sought on the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative; and (3) questions about actions that could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken to improve the functioning of the Section 106 process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but that would not be specifically included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Council invites commenters to give these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues special consideration and provide views for its use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Agency Implementing Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(a)(2)(E)(i) of the NHPA requires that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agency have procedures for compliance with Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106 that are consistent with the Council's regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Park Service, and the Council share oversight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this provision, since the Secretary is charged with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing guidance on implementing Section 110 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities. The Council wishes to encourage Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to develop such procedures to adapt the Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process to their particular needs and to better integrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 into their regular planning processes. Subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B of the revised regulations sets forth criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating consistency; outlines a process for Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of such procedures; and defines the consequences of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council finding regarding consistency. Does the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process meet the need for agency program oversight? Are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there ways the regulations could better encourage Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to adopt the required procedures in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner? Are there better alternatives to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency standards and review process? Are the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to meet the objective on achieving internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agency procedures that effectively implement Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Exemption of Certain Undertakings From the Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the development of agency procedures to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106, the proposed regulations include a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision that will allow agencies to waive the Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review for categories of undertakings which generally would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have an effect on historic properties. Since the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorical exclusions has been a major component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NEPA process, there is the potential that this provision may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be confusing. Further, approval of such a listing may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrectly infer that the exemption of a class of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertakings means that an included undertaking could never 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in adverse effect to historic properties. Should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for categorical exemptions be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised regulations? Should they be further distinguished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from NEPA categorical exclusions to avoid confusion? Are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria for categorical exemptions too broad or too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow? Should parties other than the agency and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council be able to require individual Section 106 reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for undertakings previously listed as categorical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Regulation Versus Guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When surveyed, users of the current Section 106 regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally requested more specificity and guidance on various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the regulations. The revised regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to that concern. Are the regulatory provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently detailed or have they become too specific? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where should any changes be made? Should some existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material or additional material be set forth in appendices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations or in separate, subsequently issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance documents? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations rely heavily on increased access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the public to the Section 106 process to offset the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's reduced role in individual cases. These enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities for public involvement anticipate both a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater public role in shaping decisions regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of effects on historic properties and a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
active watchdog function for the public to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are followed and decisions are made properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, expanded public participation can impose burdens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on Federal planning processes and adequate opportunities for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public input often require that extra efforts and time be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expended by Federal officials. The revised regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempt to strike a balance between these two extremes, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an emphasis on public access to the process. Has this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance been struck effectively? Are there specific places 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where public notification or participation should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthened or reduced? Should the regulations be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific on public participation or should additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance be provided in less formal channels, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance documents? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Role of Certain Interested Parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations seek to clarify and enhance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement of individuals and organizations that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant interests in the negotiating process designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid or minimize adverse effects (See Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.10(b)(1)). One such group is owners of properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the undertaking and whose interests may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacted by decisions made in the Section 106 process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the avoidance or mitigation of the undertaking's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects on historic properties. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations allow all owners of affected properties to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in negotiations for a Memorandum of Agreement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the Council can limit participation to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative if the number of owners desiring to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate becomes unwieldy. Is this a reasonable balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of access and procedural efficiency? Should only owners of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties be given this status? How broadly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should ``affected'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Substitution of State and Local Review Processes for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations allow a Certified Local Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CLG), as established under Section 101(c)(1) of the NHPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assume the role of the State Historic Preservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer (SHPO) in the Section 106 review when the Council, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SHPO, and local government are in agreement. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations delete this provision, in the interest of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoiding too many variations on the Section 106 process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resultant confusion. Should the current role of CLGs be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained? Should it be expanded to allow review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures established under local law and administered by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CLG to substitute for the Council's regulations? Should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations require Federal agencies to routinely consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with CLGs in addition to or in lieu of consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SHPOs? The current regulations allow State review systems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute for the Federal process under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. The revised regulations delete this. Should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it be retained and, if so, should it be modified from its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current form? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

7. Role of the Federal Preservation Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(c) of the NHPA requires Federal agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate an official to be responsible for coordinating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's activities under the NHPA. However, the position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and function of the Federal Preservation Officer (FPO) vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widely from agency to agency and the revised regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently silent on the issue. Given the key role the NHPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends for the FPO to play as a central agency-wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinator, should the Section 106 regulations define a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
role for the FPO? If so, should it be with regard to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual project review, terminations where Council member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment is sought (Section 800.11), the development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency procedures (Subpart B) or something else? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Disputes Over Application of the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When surveyed, users reported a serious shortcoming in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations with the lack of any process to resolve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disputes over when Section 106 applies and over the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations made in the Section 106 process. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations authorize the Council to do this at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several points. These include whether an action is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``undertaking'' (Section 800.7(a)), what the area of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects is (Section 800.8(a)), whether historic properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are present (Section 800.8(e)) and whether documentation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support agency determinations is adequate (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.14(f)). Such determinations would be legally binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of Section 106. Alternatives to Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution include giving the Federal agency the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make these determinations, referring the matter to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third party such as the Office of Management and Budget or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Justice Department or continuing the current situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the absence of a recognized administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmaker leaves resolution to the Federal courts, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if a formal legal challenge is made. Is the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system the best alternative? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Reviews and Appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several points in the current Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations which provide an opportunity for Council review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of agency decisions and for public appeals to the Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations expand the right to appeal Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency decisions to the Council by giving the public a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to request review of an agency decision, although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council may determine that the request is not timely. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 800.12(a)(1).) This expanded appeal process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to serve as a balance for the Council's withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from regular involvement in agency-SHPO decisions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 process. While the regulation (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.12(a)(1)) allows an agency to go forward with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking while the Council conducts its review, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
open-endedness of the appeals process diminishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finality of Section 106 compliance for Federal agencies. Is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appeals mechanism as proposed an effective means to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance the Council's reduced role in the review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual undertakings? Should it be broader or narrower? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the provision be revised to give a greater degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finality to the process and also afford the public fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to the Council? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Notice of Violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations authorize the Council to issue a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preliminary or final notice of violation when the Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that a Federal agency has acted in violation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 or the Council's regulations. (See Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.12(d).) Under the current regulations, the Council may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform an agency when it finds the agency in violation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in danger of violation, of Section 106 and the Council's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, but such action lacks any official sanction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the regulations and is viewed as purely advisory. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept of a formal notice of violation, adapted from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal environmental protection processes, is in response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to widespread concern that the current regulations lack 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective means of enforcement. Is the proposed notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation an appropriate method? Are there other techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or actions within the Council's legal authority to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this objective? Would the presence of stronger enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tools encourage the fulfillment of Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Treatment of Archeological Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised regulations continue the policy of the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations with regard to providing expedited review for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertakings with effects limited to archeological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources. The current process allows such cases to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed as No Adverse Effect Determinations, provided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the values of the resource are limited to scientific data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that data will be recovered in manner consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary of the Interior
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s standards and guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised regulations would essentially continue this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception, but as a Conditional No Adverse Effect Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations further clarify that such treatment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available if there is the potential for human remains to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected or traditional cultural values are present. Should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this approach be pursued or should undertakings that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threaten to destroy archeological resources, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence of human remains or traditional cultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values, be considered to have an adverse effect and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed according to Section 800.10? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Coordination With the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An identified shortcoming in the current Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations is the limited guidance provided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination between Section 106 reviews and those conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised regulations contain expanded provisions (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800.19). Is the content sufficient? Are there specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas that warrant more or less detail? Should similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance be provided for other related laws, such as Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
13. Use of Information Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rapid advances in information technology and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widespread access of Federal agencies and other Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants to it offers opportunities to improve Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106 case processing. Electronic filing of certain agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices and determinations with the Council is one example. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there specific places in the process where this kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovation should be encouraged? Do the regulations need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be modified to facilitate the use of contemporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information technology? Should formats for electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of information be specified in the regulations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related guidance documents? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's regulations, in their current and revised form, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only impose obligations on Federal agencies. If a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is legally authorized and chooses to delegate its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to local governments, then that Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency must determine whether or not its delegation will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules do not impose reporting requirements or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of information as defined in the Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. The National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 36 CFR Part 805, National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act Implementation Procedures, the Council has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council is exempt from compliance with Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866 pursuant to a memorandum issued by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and Regulatory Affairs on October 12, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Council is exempt from compliance, the Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has complied with the principles set forth in the Order by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying problems in our regulatory process and seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to modify our regulations in order to establish a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient and practical regulatory framework. The Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has sought the views of the public, including State, local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tribal entities, through the use of focus group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings, questionnaires and solicitation of informal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advice. Furthermore, the Council has voluntarily submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regulation to the Office of Management and Budget for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review in accordance with the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Executive Order 12875 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council is exempt from compliance with the documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements set forth in Executive Order 12875. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council has adhered to the principles embodied in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order. The proposed regulations, like the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, do not mandate State, local and tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments to participate in the Section 106 process, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather, mandate Federal agencies to inform and request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement of such sectors. The State, tribal or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments have the option of declining to participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process. Thus, the regulations do not impose unfunded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandates. Moreover, the Historic Preservation Fund makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monies available to States that participate in the Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106 process. The Council's proposed regulations impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations on Federal agencies and do not delegate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities to the States. If a Federal agency chooses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to delegate its responsibilities, then the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Order must be addressed by that agency. State, local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tribal representatives have been an integral part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of the proposed rules as members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's Regulations Task Force, as participants in focus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups, and as respondents to the Council's questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide a flexible process which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes various alternative procedures, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorical exemptions, programmatic agreements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of counterpart procedures to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Section 106. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Executive Order 12898 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council is not required to comply with this Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the regulations implementing Section 106 do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not pose environmental risks, but rather, seek to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects on historic properties in all areas of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

with Native American Tribal Governments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council has fully complied with this Memorandum. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native American representative serves as a member of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council and as a member of the Council's Regulations Task 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Force. The proposed regulations enhance the opportunity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native American involvement in the Section 106 process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify the obligation of Federal agencies to consult with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native Americans, fulfilling the objectives of the 1992 NHPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments.

Purposes of the Section 106 process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of their undertakings on historic properties and afford the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertakings. This part defines the manner in which Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies meet both of these statutory responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the Section 106 process. The Section 106 process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeks to accommodate historic preservation concerns with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of Federal undertakings. It is designed to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential conflicts between the two and to resolve such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflicts through consultation among the Agency Official, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Council, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other interested parties during the early stages of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning. By following the steps set forth in this part to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the effects of an undertaking on historic properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and either resolving those effects through negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements or obtaining and considering the formal written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments of the Council membership, Federal agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence that they have taken into account the effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their undertakings on historic properties and have afforded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council its reasonable opportunity to comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consultation under this part.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The fundamental principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Section 106 process is the identification and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution of preservation issues in the planning of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal undertaking through an open and ongoing exchange of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factual information and opinion between the Agency Official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and those agencies, organizations, and individuals with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in the undertaking's effects on historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties. This principle is embodied in the concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation, which means the process of seeking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussing, and considering in good faith the views of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants in the Section 106 process. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110(a)(2)(E) of the Act requires that agency procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with Section 106 provide a process for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification and evaluation of historic properties for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing in the National Register and the development and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of agreements, in consultation with State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historic Preservation Officers, local governments, Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and the interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public, as appropriate, regarding the means by which adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects on such properties will be considered. The goal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consultation process is to seek ways to avoid or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the adverse effects of an undertaking on historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties. The agency should first seek ways to avoid the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects of an undertaking, and where avoidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot reasonably or practicably be achieved, should seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ways to minimize those effects. Destruction of historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties should always be a last resort. Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commences at the earliest stages of planning between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and continues through the identification of historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties, the assessment of the undertaking's effects and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiation to resolve adverse effects, with the addition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other parties at various points and the ongoing opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participation of the public. Consultation in the Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106 process normally results in agreed upon outcomes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions. In the event that there is disagreement, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part provides that the Council will resolve disputes over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application of these regulations and specific findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under them. In the event that consultation fails to result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in resolution of an undertaking's adverse effects, the head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the agency retains final decisionmaking authority for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking after obtaining and considering the formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written comments of the Council membership.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 106 requires the Agency Official to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the Section 106 process prior to the approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the issuance of any license or permit. This does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not bar an Agency Official from expending funds on, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizing, nondestructive project planning activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparatory to an undertaking before complying with Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106, provided that such expenditures or activities do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrict the consideration of alternatives to avoid or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate adverse effects on historic properties. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official shall ensure that the Section 106 process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiated early in the planning stages of the undertaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the widest feasible range of alternatives is open for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration. The Agency Official shall establish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule for completing the Section 106 process that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the planning schedule for the undertaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conduct of reviews required under other authorities (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;800.20), and the final approval of the undertaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relation of the Section 106 process to agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation programs under Section 110.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act requires a Federal agency to establish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation program for the identification, evaluation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nomination of historic properties to the National Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the protection of such properties. Agency procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for compliance with Section 106 are a required element of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a program. Section 110 further requires that agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 procedures be consistent with this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B of this part sets forth standards and procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for determining consistency. The Council encourages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to develop their Section 110 procedures as soon as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. Unless or until an agency has formally adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its procedures and completed the process for substitution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including Council review (&sect;800.3(c)), this part governs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions taken by an agency to take into account the effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a proposed undertaking on historic properties and afford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Section 106 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency Official with jurisdiction over an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking has legal responsibility for complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106. It is the Agency Official's responsibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the agency's proposed action is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking; establish an undertaking's area of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect; identify and evaluate potentially affected historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties; assess an undertaking's likely effect upon them; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seek and consider alternatives to avoid or reduce any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects upon historic properties; decide upon an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate resolution of adverse effects; and afford the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council its comment opportunity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assistance by non-Federal parties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official may use the services of grantees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants, consultants, or designees to prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary information and analyses, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains legally responsible for Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, including all determinations charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Agency Official under this part. If any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document or study is prepared by a consultant or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractor for purposes of compliance with Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106 and this part, the Agency Official shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnish guidance and shall independently evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the document prior to its approval, taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for its scope and contents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple agencies involved in an undertaking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If more than one Federal agency is involved in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking, each agency has the responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for compliance with Section 106 and this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council and the Federal agencies, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with the Council, may mutually agree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to designate a lead Federal agency. The lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agency shall identify the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official to serve as Agency Official for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this part. Assumption of lead agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status carries with it the responsibility to act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on behalf of all participating Federal agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during Section 106 review, addressing their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collective responsibilities under Section 106 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part. Designation of one agency as lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agency does not abrogate the other Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies' responsibilities to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiation process if the Council deems it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, and to comply with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 and this part.

participation in the implementation of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historic Preservation Act and is a key participant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Section 106 process. The role of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historic Preservation Officer is to consult with and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist the Agency Official in identifying historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties, assessing effects upon them, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering and deciding upon the resolution of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects. The State Historic Preservation Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the interests of the State and its citizens in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preservation of their cultural heritage and helps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency Official identify parties interested in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking, effects upon historic properties, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives that may avoid or reduce adverse effects

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interested parties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Interested parties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those individuals and organizations that are identified

by the Agency Official or who indicate to the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official, the State Historic Preservation Officer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council in accordance with this part their concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the effects of an undertaking on historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties. If the State Historic Preservation Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the Council receive notification from interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties, they shall notify the Agency Official. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part requires that particular interested parties be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invited to participate in the Section 106 process under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain circumstances. In addition, whenever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency Official, the State Historic Preservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer, and the Council, if participating, agree that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
active participation of an interested party will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance the objectives of Section 106, they may invite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that party to participate. Anyone who wishes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Section 106 process as an interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party should notify the Agency Official in writing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make the State Historic Preservation Officer and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council aware of that request.

encouraged to take an active role in the Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106 process when undertakings affect historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties within their jurisdiction. When a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local government has legal responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 compliance under programs such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Community Development Block Grant Program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation as the Agency Official is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When no such legal responsibility exists, units of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local government may request to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 (i) Section 101(d)(6)(B) of the Act requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency Official to consult with any Indian tribe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
religious and cultural significance to historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties that may be affected by an undertaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet this responsibility, the Agency Official, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the outset of the Section 106 process, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations likely to have such interests and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify them of their opportunity to participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Section 106 process. The Agency Official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall provide for Indian tribe and Native Hawaiian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in accordance with guidance issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the National Park Service and the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Consultation shall be designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify the Indian tribe's or Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hawaiian organization's general concerns and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests regarding historic properties, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to seek their assistance in identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties and assessing effects on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such properties. The Agency Official shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commence consultation through the Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe's or Native Hawaiian organization's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing body and also include traditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cultural authorities and members of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditional communities where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To the extent feasible, consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be initiated prior to any other public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement procedures, in order to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and resolve possible concerns about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality of information on historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties. If the Indian tribe or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native Hawaiian organization requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality, the Agency Official shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the authority of Section 304 of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the confidentiality of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about historic properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Consultation shall be carried out in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner that respects the cultural values, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modes of communication, and systems of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction used by the Indian tribe or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native Hawaiian organization. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official shall be sensitive both in choosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a culturally appropriate manner of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication and in timing a request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
views from Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations. The Agency Official shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiate efforts to obtain such views early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough in the planning process, if necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to other public involvement, to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate time for responses and discussion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant preservation and traditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cultural issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Consultation shall include an Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe that does not reside in the vicinity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the undertaking when the Indian tribe has an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in historic properties affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the undertaking and has notified the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official of that interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When an Indian tribe has assumed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions of a State Historic Preservation Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Section 106 process with respect to tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands under Section 101(d)(2)(C) of the Act, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency Official shall consult with the Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe in accordance with the plan prepared by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe pursuant to that section. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official need not consult with the State Historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preservation Officer except: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

implementing of agreements, in consultation with State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historic Preservation Officers, local governments, Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and the interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public, as appropriate, regarding the means by which adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3(c) of the Native American Graves Protection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001&hyph;3013). This subpart sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth standards for making agency procedures consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council's regulations and establishes the process by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Council will evaluate such procedures. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of procedure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that deals with the implementation of Section 106 shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a procedure. Included are formal regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other procedures that are agency-wide in scope or pertain to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific program, organizational unit, or geographical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area.

Substitution of agency procedures for Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An agency procedure may substitute for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's regulations or any part thereof if it is formally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Council membership as a counterpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explain, or an agency without Council membership approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the Council membership reserves the right to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such a procedure, or any part thereof, is inconsistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Council's regulations. If an agency develops a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure that is not proposed as a counterpart procedure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency may follow such procedure to adapt the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Subpart C of this part to its programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the agency's procedure is consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's regulations. Agency procedures found by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council membership to be inconsistent with the Council's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are invalid for compliance with Section 106 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act to the extent that they are found inconsistent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The potential effects of the undertakings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the category upon historic properties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreseeable and do not by their nature have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to result in changes to the character or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of historic properties; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The agency's procedures establish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category of undertakings as a categorical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion under the National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, if applicable, consistent with the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 40 CFR 1508.4; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The agency's procedures provide that the exempted category will not be applicable if the Agency Official, the
SHPO, the Tribal Preservation Officer, if participating, or the Council determines that the normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempted excluded undertaking may have an adverse effect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establish undertaking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition set forth in &sect;800.2(dd) and with consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any categorical exclusions previously established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to &sect;800.11, the Agency Official shall decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether an undertaking exists for the purposes of Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106. If anyone disagrees with the Agency Official's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision and notifies the Council, the Council shall review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decision in accordance with &sect;800.12(a).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Coordinate with other reviews. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency Official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall establish a schedule for carrying out the steps of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 process that considers the overall planning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval schedule for the undertaking and effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination with reviews required under other authorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including, but not limited to, the National Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy Act, the Native American Graves Protection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Repatriation Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Archeological Resources Protection Act and agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislation, such as Section 4(f) of the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Transportation Act. Further information regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination of the Section 106 process with those

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plan for public participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency Official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall commence planning for informing and involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public in the conduct of the specific steps of the Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
106 process. The Agency Official should seek to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties who may be concerned about the effects on historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties, and to determine the issues that may be involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in dealing with such properties. The Agency Official should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the likely complexity of preservation issues and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possible extent of public controversy, the nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential effects of the undertaking upon historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties, the suitability of using established public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement procedures used by the agency to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Environmental Policy Act and related authorities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the overall planning and approval schedule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking. Where an Agency Official determines that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, or the State Historic Preservation Officer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council so request, the Agency Official shall establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific plan for public involvement and make it available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Council, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties, and the public at large. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official must reconsider the needs for public participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the Section 106 process proceeds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Initiate consultation with the State Historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preservation Officer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency Official shall determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officers to be involved in the Section 106 process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceed to consult in accordance with &sect;&sect;800.8&hyph;800.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the State Historic Preservation Officer declines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in writing to participate in the Section 106 process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency Official shall consult with the Council, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the State Historic Preservation Officer, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the Section 106 process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the State Historic Preservation Officer does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond within 30 days of receipt to a written request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participation at any step in &sect;800.8, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official may assume that the State Historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preservation Officer concurs in the Agency Official's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding. The Agency Official may consult with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council to complete the Section 106 process, in lieu of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further efforts to obtain a response from the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historic Preservation Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the State Historic Preservation Officer does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond within 30 days of receipt to a written request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participation at any step in &sect;&sect;800.9 or 800.10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency Official may not assume such action to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate the concurrence of the State Historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preservation Officer with the Agency Official's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position. The Agency Official may consult with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council to complete the Section 106 process, in lieu of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further efforts to obtain a response from the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historic Preservation Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Identify Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As early as possible in planning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking, the Agency Official shall initiate consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency Official has reason to believe might attach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
religious and cultural significance to historic properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the area of potential effects, or cause such contact to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be initiated by an applicant for Federal assistance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permission. Such consultation should be designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify the tribe's or organization's general concerns and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests regarding historic properties, and to seek the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe's or organization's assistance in identifying historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties and assessing effects on such properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consultation should be carried out in a manner consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;800.1(e)(5) and continue in the same manner when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying historic properties, assessing effects, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolving adverse effects.

with the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Agency Official shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Define the area of potential effects, using the definition set forth in &sect;800.2(f); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Review existing information on historic properties potentially affected by the undertaking, including any
data concerning the likelihood that unidentified historic properties exist in the area of potential effects; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Seek information from local governments, Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, traditional cultural
authorities, other organizations, and interested parties likely to have knowledge of, or concerns with, historic
properties in the area and should seek to identify the issues that may be involved in dealing with historic properties
in the planning process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the information gathered under &sect;800.8(a) and the State Historic Preservation Officer's opinion on
further actions to identify historic properties that may be affected, the Agency Official shall determine the need
for further actions, such as field surveys, modeling, informant interviews and ethnographic studies, to identify
historic properties. The Agency Official shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties
that may be affected by the undertaking and gather sufficient information to evaluate the eligibility of these properties
for the National Register. Efforts to identify historic properties shall follow applicable standards and guidelines
established by the Secretary and conform to the agency's program to meet the requirements of Section 110(a)(2) of
the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer and following the Secretary's Standards and Guidelines
for Evaluation, the Agency Official shall apply the National Register Criteria to properties that may be affected
by the undertaking and that have not been previously evaluated for National Register eligibility. The passage of
time, changing perceptions of significance, or incomplete prior evaluations may require reevaluation of properties
previously determined eligible or ineligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the property shall be considered eligible for the National Register for Section 106 purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agree that a property is not eligible. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer agree that the criteria are not met, the property
shall be considered not eligible for the National Register for Section 106 purposes, subject to any appeal or petition
under 36 CFR part 60. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resolve questions on eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer do not agree, or if the Council or the Secretary
so request, the Agency Official shall obtain a determination of eligibility from the Secretary pursuant to the applicable
National Park Service regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Agency Official determines in accordance with &sect;800.8 (a) through (c) that there are no historic properties
within the area of potential effects, the Agency Official shall provide documentation of this finding as set forth
in &sect;800.14(a) to the State Historic Preservation Officer. The Agency Official shall notify known interested
parties and make the documentation available for public inspection. Unless the Council determines otherwise in
accordance with &sect;800.12(a), the Agency Official has completed the Section 106 process.

Criteria of adverse effect. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An undertaking is considered to have an adverse effect when it may alter characteristics of a historic property that
may qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that may diminish the integrity of the property's
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Adverse effects may be direct or indirect.
Direct effects are caused by the undertaking and occur at the same time and place. Indirect effects include those caused
by the undertaking that are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable. For
the purpose of determining adverse effect, alteration to features of a property's location, setting, or use may be
relevant, depending on the property's significant characteristics, and should be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invite interested parties to participate in the

amendments leaves the existing Memorandum of Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in effect, provided that the Council may terminate any

of the status of the undertaking in the planning and

substance of the request. The Council shall deem a request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for review timely if it determines that an opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists to influence the effects of an undertaking on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties, provided that such a determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall not preclude the Council from subsequently determining

a request for review being filed or during the

requirements of that Act. When the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official elects to follow this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2)(iii), the Agency Official shall consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the State Historic Preservation Officer on

Expedited consultation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an Agency Official elects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to follow this paragraph (c), the Agency Official shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify the State Historic Preservation Officer and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council at the earliest possible time, describe the actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to resolve the adverse effects, and request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility of properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a newly discovered property has not previously been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in or determined eligible for the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register, the Agency Official may assume the property to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for purposes of Section 106. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discoveries on tribal or Federal land. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovery occurs and compliance with this section is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary on tribal or Federal lands, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official shall consult with the Indian tribe or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate parties during implementation of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section's requirements and comply with the Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agency responsibilities during resolution of issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving newly discovered properties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part do not require the Agency Official to stop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work on the undertaking. Depending on the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the property and the undertaking's adverse effects on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it, the Agency Official shall make reasonable efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to avoid or minimize harm to the property until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this section are met. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of Native American Graves Protection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Repatriation Act are applicable, the Agency Official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must comply with requirements of the Native American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to cease the activity in the area of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovery.

requesting Indian tribe, the appropriate State Historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preservation Officer or Officers, the Secretary and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties who so request. The requesting Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe shall provide the information submitted in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;800.17(b) to interested parties as determined by the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Council determines that the tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic preservation regulations will afford historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties consideration equivalent to that afforded by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's regulations, the Council shall execute an

Official, the Council will assist in the development of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a plan. The plan shall be submitted to the Council for

Purpose and scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of Section 106 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Historic Preservation Act are independent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other environmental review and protection, historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation, and resource management authorities. As such, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with one does not substitute for compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other. To promote program effectiveness and efficiency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency Officials are encouraged to coordinate and, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, integrate the requirements of Section 106 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part with the requirements of other environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and protection, historic preservation, and resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management authorities to the maximum extent feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither Section 106 or this part require that Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies comply with these related authorities, nor do they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supersede any regulations that have been issued to govern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any related authorities.

Authorities that should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered for coordination with Section 106 compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Other authorities that require agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify, evaluate, and consider effects on historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties through planning processes (e.g., National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Policy Act; American Indian Religious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Freedom Act; Federal Land Policy and Management Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Forest Management Act; and Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transportation Act, Section 4(f)); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Other authorities that require agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish mechanisms for protection and disposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties (e.g., Native American Graves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protection and Repatriation Act; Archeological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official should coordinate the identification, evaluation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, and resolution of adverse effect steps of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart C of this part with NEPA requirements, so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations reached under the Section 106 process are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately reflected in the Agency Official's decision- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making process for the proposed undertaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) During the preparation of preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental investigations and studies (and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scoping process where applicable), the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official should ensure that information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explicitly sought on the presence of historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties and the nature of any effects upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. This information is sought to be consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the spirit of NEPA to identify, avoid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize, and lastly to mitigate unavoidable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse environmental effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Agency Official is encouraged to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinate the public participation requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the EIS process with those of the Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process to eliminate duplication and maximize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public knowledge and understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking and its effects upon historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties, provided that the use of the NEPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public participation process shall not abrogate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public involvement rights afforded in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An undertaking considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically excluded from review under NEPA in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with agency procedures may require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review under Section 106 (See &sect;800.5(c)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) When the Agency Official prepares an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Assessment (EA) or Draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NEPA requirements, the EA or DEIS should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document the steps taken to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 and reflect the method by which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency Official concluded the Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The Agency Official should complete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification and evaluation of potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected historic properties and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of effects on such properties as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in Subpart C of this part prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulating or making the EA or DEIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for comment. The Agency Official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may include the resolution of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, if that step has been completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to circulation of the Draft EIS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) The Section 106 process should be used during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning process to progressively narrow resource concerns and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues requiring resolution about historic properties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic preservation. Ultimately, the objective is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve outstanding conflicts between proposed undertakings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and their effects on historic properties, and to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available an appropriate level of information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmakers so that they can ``take into account'' the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of those undertakings on historic properties when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflicts are not completely resolved. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process will be most effective when planning, review, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation, and decisionmaking steps are explicitly linked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the nature and scope of the undertaking as well as to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant planning and program requirements to the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Agency Official should establish a procedure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule for completing the Section 106 process that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the planning approach and approval schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the undertaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Agency Official should begin the Section 106 process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and integrate it with other planning needs at the earliest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible time, when the widest feasible range of alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is open for consideration. The process should be fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated with actions and preparation of documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NEPA) and other environmental and planning requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This will help to ensure that planning and decisions fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect historic preservation issues and cultural values and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns, maximize program and budgetary efficiency, and head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off potential conflicts later in the process that could lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to delays and litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Early planning. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the earliest feasible stage in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning any undertaking, in conjunction with the preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any Environmental Assessment (EA) or Draft Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impact Statement (DEIS) under the National Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy Act (NEPA), and in consultation with the State Historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preservation Officer where appropriate, the Agency Official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establish the nature of the proposed undertaking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it deal principally with operation of a program with a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of public policy objectives, management or maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources and resource types, or planning and approval of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific project? What is the extent of public investment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the undertaking? Will the effects of the undertaking be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widespread or localized? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determine what decisions need to be made about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed undertaking, and who needs to make them. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Does the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency Official for a single agency have jurisdiction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control over the undertaking, or is that jurisdiction shared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with other agencies? At what level will decisions be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the agency? If there are other Federal agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved, who will be the lead Federal agency, and how will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities be apportioned? Is all or part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking on tribal or State lands, and subject to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

legal or practical constraints may affect the planning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
execution of the proposed undertaking, such as access for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of historic properties? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establish how to identify and consult with others who may

interests might be. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To what extent should other branches within the lead Federal agency be

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about local historic preservation values and concerns? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establish the area of potential effects of each alternative under consideration,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The area of potential effects:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) direct effects are caused by the undertaking and occur at the

(C) should not be defined on the basis of land ownership or control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may include Federal and non-Federal land; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) may include geographic areas subject to indirect effects that are

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) should include alternative locations for elements of the undertaking,

locations where the undertaking may result in disturbance of the ground, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations from which elements of the undertaking may be visible (if that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is important in regard to the property's significance), and locations where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the undertaking may result in changes in land use, public access, traffic

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Programmatic actions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For undertakings involving the potential effects of a program on historic properties and historic and cultural values,
the area of potential effects should consider the nature of the program as well as the nature of historic property types
most likely to be affected by it. Planning information should be developed from knowledge of existing historic resources,
interviews with persons with special expertise or knowledge, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modeling to anticipate the full range of historic properties involved and likely effects attributable to the
program. For example, a program to replace or rehabilitate bridges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout a State needs to consider not only likely bridge locations and the direct effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of abandonment in place, demolition or dismantling, relocation, rehabilitation work, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those bridges, but also any associated archaeological sites which could be damaged or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed with ground disturbing activities such as construction equipment storage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abutment repair, pavement approach reconstruction, or bank stabilization; any nearby or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding historic districts whose character would be altered by replacement, new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, or changes in historic access patterns; and historic traditional use areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peculiar to the region (such as fish weirs or traps) that may be located in the stream itself 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at or near a new bridge location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management and maintenance areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For undertakings involving the potential effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of land-use planning or maintenance practices for specific management units, such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national park, national forest, military installation, Federal office complex, or similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrete area, the area of potential effects should consider land uses, associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management needs, and the range of potential uses of historic properties, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of maintenance requirements on particular historic property types. A planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document should establish procedures to satisfy Section 110 requirements which, among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other things, provide for long-term protection, enhancement, management and use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties and early consultation with Native Americans and other interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties. For example, a military installation resource management plan needs to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate use zones (cantonment or built-up area, vehicular or infantry training areas, firing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges and impact area, airfields, hazardous or toxic materials storage areas, high security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vs. public access areas, and other special use areas). The range of uses and possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of actions in each zone on historic structures, archaeological sites, traditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cultural properties, and other types of resources will vary considerably, as will the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's long-term management responsibility for and procedures for dealing with those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties under Section 110 and other statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For undertakings involving the potential effects of a specific federally-supported, -assisted, or -permitted
action or series of actions such as new construction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation, or transfer out of Federal ownership, agencies should at a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguish between two groups of undertakings. The first includes relatively simple, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small-scale undertakings affecting limited land area and a small number of resources. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second includes more complex undertakings affecting large land areas, multiple resources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and involving complex jurisdictional matters or other potential points of controversy. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area of potential effects for an undertaking subject to preparation of an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact statement under NEPA, defined as a ``major Federal action significantly affecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quality of the human environment,'' may necessarily involve numerous alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations or project designs, and will thus affect the level of effort necessary to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties subject to effect (see 36 CFR Sec. 800.8 and Appendix 1.C. below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope of identification of historic properties subject to effect.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Following determination of the area of potential effects appropriate to the undertaking, and coordinated with the
preparation of any Environmental Assessment (EA) or Draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) under NEPA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Agency Official should determine whether the area of potential effects has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed or otherwise inspected to identify historic properties, and review available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to decide: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the likelihood that historic properties exist within areas subject to effect, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their characteristics, numbers, and probable significance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the likelihood that such properties retain their historic, cultural, and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
architectural integrity, given what is known about historic and recent modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of land or structures in the area; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the nature and severity of effects reasonably expectable as a result of the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of undertaking involved, including both effects that will occur as the immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the undertaking, or near the site of a specific undertaking, and those that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may occur at a later time or greater distance, provided the latter are reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreseeable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The Agency Official should collect available information, determine whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking involves a programmatic action, a land management area, or a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project, and carry out further identification by making a reasonable and good faith effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects, with reference to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the undertaking, its likely effects, and the extent of available information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In order to provide a reliable basis for a ``reasonable and good faith effort'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify historic properties subject to effect, agencies should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Consult with the SHPO, local governments, Indian tribes, Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hawaiian organizations, and other Native American groups and traditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cultural authorities, community organizations, academic institutions, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others with knowledge of or concerns with history, culture, historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation issues, and specific historic properties that may be affected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Consult existing registers of historic properties, including but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the National Register of Historic Places and State and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registers, reports of prior historic property surveys, and knowledgeable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projections of historic property distributions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Review other existing information on historic properties potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the undertaking, including any data concerning the likelihood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that unidentified historic properties exist in the area of potential effect, and relevant background information
sources on each areas history, prehistory, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
architecture, sociocultural characteristics, and cultural geography as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Determine to what extent available information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a reliable basis for decisionmaking consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 requirements and 36 CFR Part 800, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the need for additional investigations given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of alternatives under consideration, the scale of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking, the nature and severity of likely effects, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessibility of each area of potential effect, and similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Programmatic actions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For undertakings involving the potential effects of a program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on historic properties and historic and cultural values, the identification of historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation issues and historic properties subject to effect should include agreement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other consulting parties on a process for ongoing identification and evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties. This may include administrative modifications to or adaptation of the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the Section 106 process contained in the Council's regulations in &sect;800.8, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may categorize types of resources that will be subject to varying identification and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation methodologies. For example, a programmatic undertaking to maintain, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modernize, selectively staff, and partially abandon fire observation towers in national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forests nationwide could involve a long-term plan to use historic records to identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate historically significant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
types
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of towers against agreed-upon criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management and maintenance areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For undertakings involving the potential effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of land-use planning or maintenance practices for specific management units, such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national park, national forest, military installation, Federal office complex, or similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrete area, the identification of historic properties subject to effect should involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporation of the process into a standard operating procedure for a General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Plan, Historic Preservation Plan, Land Use and Resource Management Plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or similar comprehensive planning tool with an appropriate national, regional, or statewide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context to evaluate the historic significance of identified resources. For example, ongoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management activities for a Bureau of Land Management district should include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing program of sample field survey, predictive modelling, and regional evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria, tied to other resource management needs and operating procedures for mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exploration, range and timber management, road construction, fire control, and recreation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. (Such a program is also required under Section 110 of NHPA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For undertakings involving the potential effects of a specific action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or series of actions such as new construction, a decision needs to be made whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
large-scale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and complex, or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
small-scale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and less complex.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) For large-scale projects, particularly those covering a very large area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or numerous alternative locations for the undertaking, the purpose of initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification efforts is to collect and review existing information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records in order to consider the likelihood that historic properties will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affected in choosing a preferred alternative for the undertaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Draft EAs, DEISs and other environmental and planning documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should, at a minimum, reflect this level of information. A less intensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation (which may include development and testing of a ``predictive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model'' to indicate where historic properties exist or are likely to exist) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be sufficient until one or more principal or preferred alternatives is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For small-scale projects, and for the principal or preferred alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of large-scale projects, the agency should determine the extent to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information provides a reliable basis for decisionmaking, and then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consult with the SHPO and others to consider the need for more detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and site-specific identification, including intensive field survey(s). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency should follow up by completing identification and ``gather sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to evaluate the eligibility of [identified] properties for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Register'' (&sect;800.8(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Coordinate identification with NEPA and other land and resource management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The magnitude of effects, both detrimental and beneficial, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on historic properties and historic and cultural values should be projected and analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in adequate detail so they can be compared to other environmental, economic, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical analyses and projections for various project alternatives. The projected number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and character of historic properties and the likely effects of each alternative on buildings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighborhoods, land use, socioeconomics, cultural values, and other relevant natural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cultural characteristics of the environment should be taken into account. Historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation documents and appropriate analyses, at least of a preliminary nature, should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be circulated and reviewed at the same time as other planning documents, such as Eas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DEISs, land management plans, engineering general design memoranda, and transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(f) analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action for any undertaking which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves alternatives that may adversely affect historic properties should be studied, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed, and described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Situations where actions are planned by private applicants or other non-Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities before Federal involvement should be adequately provided for, so that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Policies are established and staff designated to advise potential applicants of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies or other information foreseeably required for later Federal action and Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, consistent with Section 110(k); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Federal Agency consults with appropriate State and local agencies, Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and with interested private persons and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations to ensure that the concerns of other parties can be addressed before any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irretrievable or irreversible commitment to the project is made; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Federal Agency commences the Section 106 process at the earliest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible time so that by the time an EA, Finding of No Significant Impact, or Final EIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Record of Decision under NEPA is issued, historic properties have been identified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects determined, and this information is incorporated with the consideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives for any necessary resolution through negotiation with other parties.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has authorized the guaranty of loans to the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka (``Borrower'') as part of USAID's development assistance program. At this time, the Government
of Sri Lanka has authorized USAID to request proposals from eligible lenders for a loan under this program of $10 Million
U.S. Dollars (US$10,000,000). The Government of Sri Lanka (``GOSL'') has retained the services of a Financial Advisor
for this borrowing. Interested U.S. lenders or investment bankers may submit bids either directly to the Borrower's
representative and USAID or through the Financial Advisor retained by GOSL for the borrowing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is that one additional delayed-softening tomato line, which has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified by the addition of genetic material identical to that added to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tomato lines covered by the initial determination and is designated by Calgene

gene with associated regulatory sequences. Calgene's initial request to APHIS in 1992 was for a determination pertaining
to all FLAVR SAVR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transformants produced in tomato using any one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the seven plasmid vectors. Calgene indicated in its petition that data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to APHIS was representative of the data gathered for all lines tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up to that time. The initial determination announced by APHIS on October 19, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, only applied to those lines that had already been field tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, APHIS indicated that new lines were likely to exhibit properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to those of lines already field tested under permit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination also allowed for cross-breeding of the identified FLAVR SAVR

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tomato lines with any other lines or cultivars of tomato without permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new line that is the subject of this notice was a new transformant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced using one of the same plasmid vectors that were previously reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in our October 19, 1992, determination. Line N73 1436&hyph;111 has been field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested in accordance with APHIS regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Data provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to APHIS indicates that the new transformant line, produced in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical to the earlier transformant lines, behaves similarly to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier FLAVR SAVR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tomato lines to which the determination initially applied. Reports from field trials and other data indicate that
tomato line N73 1436&hyph;111 grows normally, exhibits the expected morphological, reproductive, and physiological
properties, and does not have unexpected pest or disease susceptibility or symptoms. Therefore, APHIS' determination
of nonregulated status of October 19, 1992, is considered to apply to this new transformant line as well.

The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks Bruce A. Lehman, was established as part of the White House Information Infrastructure
Task Force. The Task Force, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was created to work with Congress and
the private sector to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies aimed at articulating

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Preliminary Draft of the Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights represents the Working Group's
examination and analysis to date of the intellectual property implications of the NII, and includes the Group's draft
findings and recommendations. While it addresses each of the major areas of intellectual property law, including
patents, trademarks and trade secrets, the preliminary draft focuses primarily on copyright law and its application
and effectiveness in the context of the NII.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Information Infrastructure is a system of high-speed telecommunications networks, databases, and
advanced computer systems that will make electronic information and entertainment products more widely available
and accessible to the public than ever before. This increased availability and accessibility will dramatically
affect the way information and entertainment products are created, marketed and delivered throughout the world.
Consequently, the commercial viability of the NII hinges not only upon effectively promoting and encouraging use
of the NII by types of users, but also upon implementing standards, policies and practices that ensure that the owners
of products can effectively control access to and the integrity of their electronically disseminated products and
services. In this regard, it is essential that the public and private sectors collaborate to ensure that the interests
of owners and users of intellectual property are adequately considered in any discussion of proposed standards and
policies that may be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the issues raised by the NII, the President formed the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF). The
mission of the IITF is to articulate and implement the Administration's vision for the NII. The IITF is working with
the private sector, public interest groups, Congress and State and local governments, to develop comprehensive
telecommunications and information policies and programs that best meet the country's needs. The IITF is chaired
by the Secretary of Commerce and is comprised of senior Administration officials having expertise in the technical
and legal areas of particular importance to the NII. The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the IITF
to address the cross-cutting issue of security on the NII. The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the IITF, the President has established the U.S. National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council
(NIIAC). The NIIAC represents industry, labor, and public interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce
on issues relating to the NII. The Council has established three Mega-Projects which will form the backbone for initial
programmatic work of the NIIAC. Mega-Project III, co-chaired by John Cooke of the Disney Channel and Esther Dyson
of EDVenture, is responsible for addressing security, intellectual property and privacy issues as they relate to
the NII.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Security is linked inextricably to the commercial success of the NII. The policies and procedures used to ensure the
confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally produced and transmitted products and services on the
NII will determine whether, how, and at what cost such products and services will be made available. Without the existence
of appropriate legal, technical and policy mechanisms, the potential of the NII to be a commercially viable means
for delivering digital products and services cannot be realized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development of policies and procedures that will ensure commercial security of intellectual property on the NII
requires study from different perspectives. One such perspective is the legal protection of intellectual property.
This topic is presently being addressed by the IITF Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Bruce
A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. The Working Group on Intellectual
Property has recently released a preliminary report on intellectual property issues on the NII and has conducted
a series of public hearings to receive views on the preliminary report and any other concerns about intellectual property
raised by the NII.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A second perspective concerns a more functional approach to protecting intellectual property; namely, what legal
measures, policy mechanisms, and technological solutions, or combinations thereof, aside from intellectual property
laws, can be used to effectively protect commercial products and services delivered or made accessible using the
NII. This latter topic is the subject that the Forum and Mega-Project III wish to develop through this public hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forum and Mega-Project III seek input from parties who will produce and make accessible commercial products and
services via the NII, as well as users of such products and services. A panel of witnesses drawn from the public will
be assembled to discuss the following topics with a panel comprising the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks,
members of the Security Information Forum and members of Mega-Project III of the NIIAC, and to field questions and
comments from other members of the public:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What types of projects and services are you contemplating delivering or making available, or would you like to see
delivered or made available on the National Information Infrastructure?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What capacity do you want to provide to users of the NII to view, hear, retrieve, reproduce, modify or further distribute
your products and services? As a user of such products and services, what capabilities in this regard would you like
to see made available by content producers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What commercial threats do you foresee in making products and services available via the NII, in terms of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Unauthorized access to or theft of products or services; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Integrity or confidentiality of information delivered or retrieved via the NII? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What kinds of technical solutions are you aware of, or would you like to see developed, to address security concerns?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on September 6, 1988, (52 FR 34285) set forth reimbursement changes that were effective for all inpatient hospital
admissions in psychiatric hospitals and exempt psychiatric units occurring on or after January 1, 1989. The final
rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on July 1, 1993, (58 FR 35&hyph;400) set forth maximum per diem rates for all partial hospitalization admissions on
or after September 29, 1993. Included in these final rules were provisions for updating reimbursement rates for each
federal fiscal year. As stated in the final rules, each per diem shall be updated by the Medicare update factor for hospitals
and units exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System. Medicare has recommended an update factor of 3.7 percent
for federal fiscal year 1995 for hospitals and units excluded from the prospective payment system. CHAMPUS will adopt
this update factor for FY 1995 as the final update factor. Hospitals and units with hospital-specific rates (hospitals
and units with high CHAMPUS volume) will have their FY 1994 CHAMPUS per diem rates updated by 3.7 percent for FY 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director of the Information
Resources Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior
to submission of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following:
(1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency
of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract.
OMB invites public comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Patrick J. Sherrill
at the address specified above.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for license of the existing Crystal
Falls Project No. 11402. The Crystal Falls Project is located on the Paint River in Iron County, Michigan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff's EA will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project
and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA
will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be
presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.

Scoping Meetings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FERC will conduct two scoping meetings. An evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while the morning
meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited
to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. Staff
will also visit the project site on November 2, 1994, at 9 a.m.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both scoping meetings will be held at the City Hall Auditorium, 401 Superior Avenue, Crystal Falls, Michigan. The
first meeting will be held on November 1, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and will focus primarily on issues of concern to
the general public. The second meeting will be held on November 2, 1994, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will focus primarily
on issues of concern to the resource agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the meetings, a scoping document will be mailed to the list of interested parties. The scoping document identifies
resource issues to be addressed in the EA. Copies of the scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings
or can be obtained by writing: FERC-Crystal Falls Project, c/o Elaine Bazarian, Stone and Webster, 245 Summer Street,
Boston, MA 02110.

Take notice that on September 9, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1111 South 103rd Street, Omaha, Nebraska
68124&hyph;1000, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;766&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to install
five delivery points and upgrade one delivery point to accommodate increased natural gas deliveries to Peoples Natural
Gas Company (Peoples) under Northern's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;401&hyph;000 pursuant
to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern proposes to install and operate one Town Border Station (TBS), four small volume customer taps, and upgrade
one TBS and appurtenant facilities as delivery points to accommodate increased natural gas deliveries to Peoples
under Northern's currently effective throughput rate schedules. The upgraded and new delivery points will be used
for commercial and residential end-use by Peoples for redelivery to: 1) Bruce Pals (Pals) in Chicago City, Minnesota,
Section 2, T37N, R21W; 2) Eileen Beninga (Beninga) in Black Hawk City, Iowa, Section 6, T88N, R14W; 3) Justin Deutsch

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern states that deliveries of the estimated total volumes to Peoples at these delivery points will be made pursuant
to Northern's existing transportation service agreements. Northern advises that the total volumes to be delivered
to the customer after the request do not exceed the total volumes authorized prior to the request. Northern states
it has sufficient capacity for the proposed changes without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers.

Northwest states that upgraded facilities are needed to better accommodate its existing firm maximum daily delivery
obligations at this delivery point to Intermountain Gas Company (Intermountain). Northwest proposes to replace
four existing 3-inch regulators with four new 4-inch regulators, relief valve, new upstream headers, relocate filter,
replace station by-pass and appurtenances. Northwest states that the upgrade will increase the design capacity
of the station from 14,670 Dth per day to approximately 24,600 Dth per day. Northwest further states that the total
cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $289,191. Since this expenditure is necessary to increase the
design capacity to serve existing maximum daily delivery obligation, Northwest will not require any cost reimbursement
from Intermountain.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In July of 1994, Administrator Browner established the Permits Improvement Team (Team) to implement specific actions
to reform the permits process. These actions will: (1) improve the quality, certainty and timeliness of the permit
decision process; (2) provide for earlier and better public participation in the permitting process; and (3) enhance
the use of innovative technologies and pollution prevention through the permitting process. From October 20, 1994
through November 21, 1994 the Team will be holding national stakeholder meetings to receive individual input on the
specific activities the Team should focus on. The objective of these meetings is to obtain individual ideas and comments,
but not to obtain a group opinion from the meeting participants.

The Respondents will pay approximately $23,649,894.84 in settlement payments for response costs related to the
American Chemical Services Site, including past response costs incurred by the State of Indiana, if the United States
Environmental Protection Agency determines that it will not withdraw or withhold its consent to the proposed settlement
after consideration of comments submitted pursuant to this office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. EPA may enter into this settlement under the authority of Section 122(g) of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
settlements with potentially responsible parties (``PRPs'') that contributed hazardous substances to a site where
those contributions were small and where the toxicity of the substances contributed is not significantly different
from the other substances brought to the site. Pursuant to this authority, the agreement proposes to settle with generator
parties whose individual volume of hazardous substances sent to site does not exceed .08% of the total amount of hazardous
substances sent to the site. Settling 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PRPs will be required to pay their fair share of the past and estimated future response costs at the site based on a payment
of $3.76 per pound of hazardous substances that the party contributed to the Site. Certain reduction factors were
applied in determining the pounds sent by each company based upon the operations of the ACS facility at different time
periods. Some participants in the settlement also have presented ability to pay issues and have settled on that basis.
The estimated future response costs account for potential cost overruns, the potential for failure of the remedies
selected to clean up the site, and other risks.

A copy of the proposed administrative order on consent and additional background information relating to the settlement,
including a list of parties to the settlement, are available for review and may be obtained in person or by mail from

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of the below listed
receivership estates are insufficient to wholly satisfy the priority claims of depositors against the receivership
estates. Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution or payment
to any creditor of lessor priority, including but not limited to, claims of general creditors. Any such claims are
hereby determined to be worthless.

Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part A, Chapter AG (Office of the General Counsel) (38 FR 17032, June 28, 1973, as amended most recently at 57 FR 10765,
March 30, 1992) and Part H, Chapter HF (Food and Drug Administration) 35 FR 3685, February 25, 1970, as amended most
recently at 59 FR 38482, July 28, 1994) of the Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority
for the Department of Health and Human Services is amended to reflect an organizational change in the Office of the
General Counsel (OGC) and in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OGC in the Office of the Secretary, HHS, and FDA find it in their common interest and interest of the Department to
test the efficacy of decentralizing the provision of legal services to FDA by establishing an organizational component
within FDA comprised of lawyers and support staff who will provide certain legal services exclusively to that Agency
and be funded by that Agency, but be subject to the supervision of the General Counsel with respect to legal policy and
direction. OGC will continue to provide legal services to FDA in the areas of ethics, business and administrative
law, legislation, personnel, and procurement on the same basis as OGC provides such services to other HHS operating
divisions generally. A new Office of the Chief Counsel will be established in FDAs Office of the Commissioner and simultaneously
the Food and Drug Division will be removed from OGC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following changes are made to reflect the organizational change:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=87 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Chapter AG, Section AG&hyph;B, Organization

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Insert a new subparagraph under the Office of the Commissioner (HF), the Office of Chief Counsel (HFA&hyph;J) reading

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2)
an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory
committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OBRA '93), Public Law 103&hyph;66, created the Pediatric Vaccine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution Program (more commonly known and hereafter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which takes effect on October 1, 1994. Section 13631 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '93 added section 1902(a)(62) to the Social Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (the Act) to require that States provide for a program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the purchase and distribution of pediatric vaccines to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program-registered providers for the immunization of vaccine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible children in accordance with section 1928 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. Section 13631 redesignated the existing section 1928 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as section 1931 and inserted a new section 1928. The new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1928 requires each State to establish a VFC Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(which may be administered by the State department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health) under which certain specified groups of children are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitled to receive qualified pediatric immunizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without charge for the cost of the vaccine.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federally purchased vaccines under the VFC Program will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made available to children who are 18 years of age or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
younger and_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Who are eligible for Medicaid; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Who are not insured under any form of health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Who are not insured with respect to the vaccine and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are administered pediatric vaccines by a federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified health center (FQHC) or in a rural health clinic; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Who are Indians, as defined in section 4 of the Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health Care Improvement Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the VFC program, vaccines must be administered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program-registered providers. Section 1928(c) defines a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program-registered provider as any health care provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is licensed or authorized to administer pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines under the law of the State in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration occurs without regard to whether or not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider is a Medicaid-participating provider; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Submits to the State an executed provider agreement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the form and manner specified by the Secretary; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Has not been found by the Secretary or the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have violated a provider agreement or other requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may apply that are established by the Secretary or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providers may participate in the VFC program without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in Medicaid if they are qualified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer vaccines under applicable State law. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such providers will not be reimbursed by Medicaid for their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services in administering the vaccine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the VFC Program, a provider may impose a fee for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine as long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the fee, in the case of a Federally vaccine-eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child, does not exceed the cost of such administration (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary based on actual regional costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such administration). However, a provider may not deny 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine-eligible child due to the inability of the child's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents or legal guardian to pay the administration fee.

II. Provisions of This Notice With Comment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces interim regional maximum charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These represent the maximum amount that a provider in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State may charge for the administration of qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric vaccines to Federally vaccine-eligible children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the VFC Program. It also specifies the methodology that HCFA used to establish these regional maximum charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are interpreting ``regional'' as specified in the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be the ``State'', as discussed in section II.B.2. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice. In addition, this notice gives Universal Purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States (that is, where the vaccines are purchased by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State for all children in the State) the right to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration charges that differ from those established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA, provided they are reasonable. Therefore, Universal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purchase States are provided the flexibility to accept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum charges established by the Secretary or to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own maximum charges. In either case, the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gives State Medicaid agencies the option to establish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply vaccine administration fees that are lower than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified maximum charges if they provide assurances that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid children have access to immunizations to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent as the general population. Section 1902(a)(30)(A) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, as amplified by section 1926, requires States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay enough for obstetrical and pediatric services (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include immunization services) so that those services are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the ``Medicaid population'' to the same extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are available to the general population in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic area. These assurances must be submitted to HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the appropriate State plan amendment to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fees. This notice specifies guidelines for States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in setting lower administration fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administration charge cap applies to all VFC Program-registered providers that administer the vaccine to a Federally
vaccine-eligible child. It does not apply to children receiving free vaccines under State purchase programs or any
other arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the statute, physicians participating in the VFC Program can charge non-Medicaid eligible children
the maximum administration charge (if that charge reflects the provider's cost of administration) regardless of
whether the State has established a lower administration fee under the Medicaid program. However, there would be
no Federal Medicaid matching funds available for such administration. Although the cost of the vaccines for the VFC
Program is funded under Title XIX of the Act, Medicaid will not pay for the administration of vaccines provided to children
under the VFC Program who are not eligible for Medicaid. A provider may only bill Medicaid for the administration of
a vaccine if the child is Medicaid eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the VFC program is mandated by law to become operational on October 1, 1994, we are announcing these regional
maximum administration charges and guidelines for documenting access on an interim basis, subject to comment and
revision. We will issue a final 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document setting forth the applicable requirements and responding to public comments on the provisions of this notice
that we receive on a timely basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

B. Methodology Used to Establish Administration Charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We used the following methodology to establish the regional maximum charges for administration of qualified pediatric
vaccines set forth under section II.C. of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Basis for Using Charge Data versus Cost Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the statute provides that these maximum charges are to be based in the actual costs of vaccine administration,
as determined by the Secretary. This provision posed a serious implementation problem for HCFA because of the unavailability
of usable actual cost data on a nationwide basis and the urgency of promulgating maximum fees before the VFC program
begins operation. We searched thoroughly for appropriate data on the costs of vaccine administration. We also consulted
with several organizations and with individuals with knowledge and expertise in issues regarding physician payment,
including the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC). We were informed that there are no data readily available
on physicians' actual costs that would provide a valid basis for setting these maximum charges on a nationwide scale.
It also was apparent to us that it would not be possible to generate such data via field research within the time available
to implement the VFC program on October 1, 1994. A proper analysis would require detailed, expensive, and time-consuming
collection and evaluation of data on each element of both direct and indirect costs, including equipment, supplies
and labor, as well as an appropriate verification and allocation of ``overhead'' costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of this information, we concluded that we should explore setting the maximum charges based on data regarding
actual charges for the administration of vaccines in physicians' offices. This, too, posed a problem. We consulted
with insurance companies, physicians' groups, trade associations, the PPRC, and other knowledgeable experts.
Again, we concluded that accurate, consistent data on charges were not readily available. There are a number of concerns
about the data that are available, including inconsistencies in the coding of procedures and the fact that most payers
do not differentiate, or pay separately for, the cost of the vaccine and its administration. In light of these problems,
we were unable to construct a reliable data base by integrating data from existing information sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We concluded that it would be necessary to generate a data base specifically for this purpose. For the reasons stated
above, it was not feasible to generate a data base using actual costs, but it was feasible to do one based on charges.
In the absence of valid studies to the contrary, we think that, for this particular service, charge data is a reasonable
proxy for setting these maximum fees until we are able to obtain cost data. Our conclusion is reinforced by the provision
of the statute requiring physicians to agree not to refuse to vaccinate a child because of the family's inability to
pay the administration fee and by the knowledge that many physicians currently either do not bill indigent patients
their full charge or accept less than full payment from them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the statutory requirements that the administration fees not exceed the costs of administration, we recognize
the importance of utilizing cost data in developing the regional maximum charges. We also realize that the use of charge
data in developing the maximum charges may result in maximum charges that are too high. While it appears that there
are no useable cost data readily available, our goal is to obtain information that can be used in setting maximum charges
in the future. We will be conducting a study to accumulate accurate cost data, and will revise the maximum charges based
on cost as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fiscal year 1995 Department of Health and Human Services appropriations bill specifically addresses the use
of charge versus cost data. (140 Cong. Rec. H9306, Sept. 20, 1994) The Secretary is directed to compute the actual cost
of administering vaccines and to revise the fees in accordance with the requirements of the law. Because the appropriations
bill also states that this directive is not intended to delay the start-up of the VFC program, we will utilize the interim
maximum charges. However, as stated above, we will conduct a study with the goal of obtaining accurate cost data and
will issue revised maximum charge amounts as soon as possible.

2. Charge Data Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To obtain a data base of physician charges, we contracted with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to purchase
data on the normal fee charged by its members for administering the vaccines to be covered by this program. (We note
that AAP did not believe it could obtain cost data by directly surveying its membership.) The AAP had gathered these
data from a national, sample survey of its members. The sample was large enough (approximately 1,114 responses) to
give us confidence in the national average, but not large enough in each State to allow us to set state-by-state maximum
charges without further adjustment. The preliminary results of the survey indicated that the overall average administration
charge was $14.48. The final national average administration charge we obtained from the AAP was $15.09.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to adjust this national average for regional variations, we concluded that the most reliable means available
was the Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) established for the Medicare physician fee schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GPCI is an index developed by a joint effort of the Urban Institute (UI) and the Center for Health Economics Research
(CHER) to measure the differences in resource cost among localities compared to the national average in the three
components of the relative value units_physician work, practice expenses, excluding malpractice, and malpractice.
These three components are weighted 54.2 percent, 40.2 percent, and 5.6 percent, respectively. The resource inputs
and their weights were obtained from the American Medical Association's (AMA) Socioeconomic Characteristics of
Medical Practice. The weights for the current GPCIs are from the AMA's l989 Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS)
Survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there is more than one GPCI for a State, we used the GPCI with the highest values to derive the maximum charge in order
to assure that the administration charge for providers in high cost areas would fall within our established maximum.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GPCIs are grouped by State and substate areas. For purposes of developing the regional maximum charges, we interpreted
the term ``regional'' used in the statute to mean ``State'' because of the specific grouping of the data using the GPCIs.
While the GPCI is grouped by State and substate areas, we decided to use the State grouping only. The geographic area
of a State is clearly identifiable by boundary lines recognized nationwide, as opposed to a substate area. In other
words, substate areas do not necessarily represent counties, which would be an easily identifiable geographic area.
Therefore, we believe using substate geographic areas would be confusing to both States and providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We derived the amounts specified in the chart under section II.C. of this notice as the maximum charges that may be charged
for the administration of qualified pediatric vaccines for each State on the basis of the following formula: National
charge data &times; total weighted GPCI = maximum charge.

D. Maximum Charges for Administration of Vaccines in Universal Purchase States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States that have programs under which the State purchases vaccines for all children in the State (Universal Purchase
States) have the flexibility to accept the maximum charges developed by HCFA or to develop their own maximum charges.
We believe it is necessary that Universal Purchase States are provided sufficient flexibility in developing charges
in order to ensure that there is equal access to immunizations for all children. In these States, we believe the State
may wish to set one overall charge cap in order to encourage adequate provider participation. Furthermore, it is our
understanding that providers should experience no cost differences between VFC program eligible children and all
other children inasmuch as the provider never incurs the cost of the vaccine.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While Universal Purchase States have the flexibility to develop their own caps, they must develop these by utilizing
a reasonable methodology based upon the requirements of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act. The amount of the cap
is not required to be set in State law. However, the authority to set an amount must be based in State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Optional Lower Medicaid Administration Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State Medicaid agencies are not obligated to set the Medicaid payment for vaccine administration at the level of the
maximum charges set forth in this notice. Section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act allows them to set their payment at
a lower level, according to their own judgment. State Medicaid agencies typically set payment rates taking into consideration
a variety of factors, including the need to assure adequate participation by providers. Since the maximum charges
in this notice are based on the normal charges billed by physicians, rather than on the amounts actually collected
by physicians from insurers or patients, State Medicaid agencies may determine that a lower payment level is appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State Medicaid agency elects to pay a lower fee, it must provide assurances to HCFA, as described below, that
Medicaid-eligible children will have access to vaccines. In addition, a State Medicaid agency may elect to apply
the regional maximum charges in selected areas of the State and a lower fee in other areas. Any lower fees that a State
Medicaid agency elects to apply must be justified using the guidelines specified in section II.F. of this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of Universal Purchase States that elect to develop their own maximum charges, State Medicaid agencies
have the flexibility to pay the maximum charge or to pay a lower fee subject to the same provisions discussed above.

F. Documentation Guidelines for Optional Lower Medicaid Administration Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Pediatric Services Defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As defined in section 1926(a)(4)(B) of the Act, the term ``pediatric services'' means ``services covered under the
State plan provided by a pediatrician, family practitioner, or certified pediatric nurse practitioner to children
under 18 years of age and does not include inpatient or outpatient hospital services or other institutional services.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Immunization Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In applying any of the guidelines under section II.F.3. of this notice, we believe it is necessary to identify what
children would be considered immunized. In order to be counted toward the immunization rate goals discussed, a child
must have received, within the year period of measure for access, all immunizations required for his or her particular
age, including those immunizations under a revised schedule because of those missed from a previous year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Data Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the State elects to pay an administration fee lower than the maximum charge set forth in section II.C. of this notice,
it must provide, via the obstetrical/pediatric State plan amendment submittal, data that document that the lower
or varying fees meet the statutory requirements of sections 1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act and the implementing
regulatory requirements of 42 CFR 447.204. Section 447.204 of the regulations specify that a Medicaid agency's payments
must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that services under the plan are available to recipients at least
to the extent that those services are available to the general population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State may use one or more of the following guidelines to document that the statutory and regulatory requirements
are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Comparison of Ratios 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this guideline, the State would submit a comparison between the following ratios: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ratio of the number of children in the general population immunized to the number of children in the general
population; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The ratio of the number of Medicaid children immunized to the number of Medicaid children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for a State to use this guideline as an equal access assurance, the ratio of Medicaid children immunized to
the number of Medicaid children would have to be equal to or greater than the ratio of the general population immunized
to the number of children in the general population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Comparison to Private Insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another alternative is for the State to do a comparison of the Medicaid fees for administration of pediatric vaccines
to the administration fees paid by a major insurance company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for the State to use this guideline as an equal access assurance, the Medicaid rates for the administration
of pediatric vaccines would have to be set at a rate equal to or greater than the private insurance company's rates up
to the established State maximum fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Practitioner Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State also may compare: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The number of Medicaid pediatric practitioners (which includes practitioners listed in section 1926(a)(4)(B)
of the Act) who are Medicaid program- registered providers and who have submitted pediatric immunization claims;
and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The total number of pediatric practitioners providing immunizations to children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program registered providers must have at least one Medicaid pediatric immunization claim per month or an average
of 12 such claims during the year. The State would need 50 percent participation to show equal access through use of
this guideline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States have the flexibility to devise alternative measures of equal access to immunizations. HCFA will evaluate
these other methods by which States can choose to demonstrate equal access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Submittal of State Plan Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A State Medicaid agency must specify the reimbursement for the administration of pediatric vaccines (and, if applicable,
submit documentation of equal access) as part of its obstetrical/pediatric payment rate State Medicaid plan amendment
submittal that are due by April 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 1995 (and which are effective July 1, 1995). If the
State Medicaid agency elects to pay the maximum regional amount statewide (including that established by the State
in Universal Purchase States), it need only specify this in its State plan amendment submittal (no additional documentation
will be needed). However, if the State Medicaid agency elects to vary the vaccine administration fee by geographic
areas within the State, the State must list the administration fee for each area, and specify the methodology, and
provide the data and methodology it used to demonstrate equal access to the vaccines for each geographic area where
the maximum charges are not applied. This documentation requirement is consistent with the requirements currently
imposed for submittal of State Medicaid plan amendments for obstetrical and pediatric payment rates under sections
1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act. We also believe that documenting access to immunizations by each geographic area
provides a more accurate picture of access and areas where access is problematic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State plan amendment must be submitted by December 31, 1994 and be effective on October 1, 1994. For the interim
period of October 1, 1994 through March 31, 1995, States may claim Federal matching funds for the costs of administration
of vaccines to Medicaid-eligible children using the maximum charges or the lower fees established on the basis of
the guidance provided in this notice. For this interim State plan amendment, the State will not be required to submit
the data to document access to immunizations but will be required to list the methodology by which Medicaid beneficiary
access to immunizations is assured. Beginning April 1, 1995, documentation of equal access to immunizations will
be required to be included as part of the yearly Obstetrical/Pediatric State plan amendment submittal in accordance
with section 1926 of the Act.

III. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For notices such as this, we generally prepare a flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a notice will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of a RFA, States and individuals are not considered
small entities. However, providers are considered small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any notice
of proposed rulemaking that may have a significant impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act,
we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer
than 50 beds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice with comment period implements a provision of section 1928 of the Act. Specifically, this notice with
comment period announces interim regional maximum charges that providers may impose for administering pediatric
vaccines to Federally vaccine-eligible children under the VFC Program. Section 1928 of the Act directs the Secretary
to establish regional maximum fees. As discussed in section II. B of this notice, HCFA contracted with the American
Academy of Pediatrics to conduct a survey to obtain national charge data for the administration of pediatric vaccines.
HCFA used this data to develop a national charge amount and then adjusted this amount to take into account regional
variations to establish a charge for each State. The GPCIs established for the Medicare physician fee schedule were
used to make this adjustment. Universal Purchase States have the flexibility to accept the maximum charges developed
by HCFA or to develop their own maximum charges. HCFA is also permitting State Medicaid agencies to develop a lower
administration fee than the maximum charge if they can demonstrate equal access for children to the vaccines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of implementing the provision of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act is discussed further below. We do
not believe that this provision will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that a legislative provision being implemented by a notice such as this may have a significant effect
on recipients or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns.
In this instance, it is difficult to predict what the fiscal impact of this notice will be. There are several unknown
factors. Among them are the number of program-eligible providers who will elect to administer the vaccines. In addition,
State Medicaid agencies are not required to pay the maximum charges. State Medicaid agencies may establish and apply
lower vaccine administration fees if they document that Medicaid children have access to immunizations to the same
extent as the general population. Given the availability of free vaccines and the fact that State payments for all
pediatric and obstetrical services, including, presumably, vaccine administration, have for some time been subject
to access demonstration requirements under 42 CFR 447.204 and sections 1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act, we believe
that a large proportion of States will be able to demonstrate equal access for Medicaid-eligible children at rates
lower than the maximum charges. In addition, should a State Medicaid agency not be able to demonstrate equal access
at its current rates, the State Medicaid agency would only have to increase its rates to where there would be equal access.
The publication of the maximum charge schedule will certainly create pressure in States with vaccine administration
fees for Medicaid-eligible children lower than the maximums to raise those fees. However, to the extent that these
States can provide the required assurances, they will not need to raise their fees. (Currently, it appears that most
States pay for vaccine administration under Medicaid at rates well below the proposed maximum. This is allowable
under the statute.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, the magnitude of any increase in Medicaid outlays is difficult to ascertain. Because of the pre-existing equal
access demonstration requirements, we find it hard to estimate how much of any increase in charges would be attributable
to the specific guidelines of this notice and how much would occur without publication of the notice. We invite public
comment on the impact of both the equal access assurances and anticipated fee increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are providing a voluntary regulatory flexibility analysis because of the large number of children and providers
who may be affected. Normally, a regulatory flexibility analysis requires the agency to discuss various alternatives
to the provisions in a notice. As discussed above, however, HCFA is implementing the provisions of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii)
of the Act. The focus of this legislation is upon expanding the number of children who are eligible to receive free pediatric
vaccines. We have provided State Medicaid agencies with an option of using a lower fee than the maximum charges set
forth in this notice or using a charge established by a Universal Purchase State at their option if they can demonstrate
equal access of children to the pediatric vaccines. Because indicated Congressional intent was to expand the coverage
for vaccines, we believe that permitting State Medicaid agencies to use a lower fee where they can demonstrate equal
access of children to the pediatric vaccines is consistent with the statute. In addition, we note that this option,
if utilized by State Medicaid agencies, will cost Federal and State governments less money than if the State Medicaid
agencies were using the maximum regional charges as set forth in this notice, while simultaneously achieving Congress'
goal.

1. Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each program-registered provider who administers a qualified pediatric vaccine is entitled to receive the vaccine
without charge either for the vaccine or its delivery to the provider. This notice specifically establishes maximum
regional charges for providers to administer the vaccines. As a result of these maximum regional charges, we believe
that the number of providers who may be willing to administer the vaccines would be maintained or increased. In addition
to a potential increase in the number of providers who may be willing to administer these vaccines, there may be an increase
in the number of patients that they treat since section 1928 of the Act expands the number of children who are eligible
to receive the vaccine without charge.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The greatest benefit of this provision is that it expands the number of children who are eligible to receive pediatric
vaccines without charge for the vaccines. We believe that there will be an increase in the number of children receiving
pediatric vaccines. As the number of children who are vaccinated increases, we believe that savings will accrue as
a result of a decline in the number of children who will require treatment for vaccine-preventable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VFC Program. Specifically, this program will provide free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines and free delivery to States thus saving States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monies that would otherwise be spent on purchase and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery of vaccines. Where they can demonstrate equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access, State Medicaid agencies are given the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the regional charge as specified in this notice or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower fee. States could experience an increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of children who are receiving the vaccines, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving Congress' goal though increasing their pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immunization costs. As discussed above, fewer children may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be treated for vaccine-preventable illnesses which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a savings to the States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Competing applications for grants authorized under sections 747 and 748 are reviewed by chartered review committees.
It is proposed that the following review criteria and weighted indicators be used by the chartered review committees
for the FY 1995 grant cycles. Public comments are invited on the one proposed review criterion and the weighted indicators
associated with all four review criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This review criterion and weighted indicators are proposed in this combined notice, rather than in individual program
announcements, to provide consistent review of all primary care medical education grant applications. A funding
notice for Grants for Family Medicine Training for FY 1995 has been published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A funding notice for Grants for General Internal Medicine and General Pediatrics will be published should funds become
available for competitive cycles in FY 1995. Deadline dates and other specific information regarding these grant
programs are included in funding notices.

General Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grants provided in support of primary care medical education are intended to produce, over time, a training infrastructure
capable of meeting the nation's needs for generalist health care practitioners by the year 2000 and beyond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Division of Medicine (DM), Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr), has developed the following Strategic Directions
for fiscal year 1995: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Generalism_increasing the number of generalist physicians, including the coordination and integration
of training opportunities designed to produce generalists; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Workforce diversity, particularly the training of minorities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Strategies to improve health care for the underserved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Improve primary care quality; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Increase primary care faculty and researchers; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Emphasize public health and interdisciplinary training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants are encouraged to consider each application as part of an integrated institutional plan that considers
these strategic directions in providing education and training that encourages the selection and future practice
of generalist physicians in the disciplines of family medicine, general internal medicine and general pediatrics.

Review Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Considering charter review committee recommendations, the Secretary will approve projects which best promote
the purposes of sections 747 and 748 of the PHS Act, taking into consideration the following review criteria established
in 42 CFR part 57, subparts Q, R, and FF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The administrative and management ability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective
manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining basis after the period of grant support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for the project requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the following review criterion is proposed for FY 1995: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Potential effectiveness of the proposed project in carrying out the training purposes of sections 747 or 748 of
the PHS Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the above review criteria, weighted indicators have been identified. These indicators, which are listed below,
will measure, among other things, the qualifications of the proposed staff and faculty, the institution's commitment
to preparing generalist physicians, and the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority and disadvantaged
faculty, students, trainees and/or residents. These issues have been addressed in previous grant cycles as review
criteria or funding factors. The review criteria and indicators were developed for the FY 1995 grant cycle with input
from potential applicants for these grant programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The points available for the various grant programs in the ``Potential Effectiveness'' criterion vary slightly.
This is a result of a small number of indicators that are specific to individual grant programs. In general, this category
relates to the overall institutional environment in which the program is located and the manner of support for establishing
or enhancing the training of generalist physicians at the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Administrative and Management Ability'' review criterion has the highest number of points and is consistent
across all grant programs because this area of the application will describe the proposed project for which the grant
funds are being requested. The proposal needs to clearly detail the proposed project as well as relate the proposed
project to the institution's overall goal of establishing or enhancing its training infrastructure in order to produce
more generalist physicians to meet the needs of the Nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Economic Viability'' points are consistent across all grant programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Project Requirements'' points vary considerably for some programs. This is related to the differing number
of project requirements specific to each grant program as well as the significance of some of the indicators. For example,
for Family Medicine Residencies, the points are lower to reflect the fact that residency programs that are accredited
or approved by the appropriate accrediting body, have already met the project requirements.

A. SBIR Program Phases, Award Amounts, and Period of Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SBIR Program consists of the following three phases: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Phase I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this phase is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of proposed research or R&amp;D efforts
and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization before furnishing further
Federal support in Phase II. Phase I awards will be approximately $35,000 to $50,000 (for both direct and indirect
costs) for a period not to exceed 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Phase II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this phase is to continue the research or R&amp;D efforts initiated in Phase I and to actually create
the proposed product and test it before marketing. Funding is based on the results of Phase I and the scientific and
technical merit of the Phase II application, including its potential for commercialization. (Only Phase I awardees
are eligible to apply for Phase II funding.) Phase I awardees are eligible to apply for Phase II funding only from the
Federal agency that supported their Phase I project. Phase II awards will be approximately $100,000 (for both direct
and indirect costs) for a period normally not to exceed 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Phase III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this phase, if appropriate, is for the small business concern to pursue with non-Federal funds the
commercialization of the results of the research or R&amp;D in Phases I and II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to invite Phase I and II grant applications from for-profit domestic small business concerns
that have the expertise to develop or further develop innovative technology. This technology should be compatible
with the general mission of HCFA and contribute to the health care field. HCFA is responsible for the Medicare program,
Federal participation in the Medicaid program, and related health care quality assurance programs. HCFA's mission
is to promote the timely delivery of appropriate quality health care to its Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients;
over 50 million of the nation's aged, disabled, and poor. HCFA must also ensure that Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
recipients are aware of the services for which they are eligible. In addition, HCFA must ensure that those services
are accessible and of high quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In carrying out its mission, HCFA conducts studies and projects that examine and demonstrate payment, coverage,
eligibility, and management alternatives to the present programs. HCFA also studies the impact of HCFA programs
on health care costs, program expenditures, beneficiary and recipient access to services, health care providers,
and the health care segment of the American economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, HCFA monitors national health care expenditures and prices and provides analyses of the costs of current
programs, as well as the impact of possible legislative or administrative changes in the programs. HCFA's Office
of Research and Demonstrations (ORD) is responsible for the technical aspects of the SBIR Program described in this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice outlines the eligibility requirements for organizations wishing to participate in the HCFA SBIR Program
and the research grant application and review processes. It also provides both general program information as well
as specific research topics and subtopics that may be of interest to small business concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although areas of special programmatic interest or priority are described in section VII. of this notice, we will
consider grant applications in any area within the field of health care R&amp;D unless otherwise specifically excluded.
However, we are not generally interested in funding the biomedical or clinical projects that more appropriately
fit the mission of the National Institutes of Health.

B. Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each organization submitting a grant application under our SBIR Program must qualify as a small business concern.
``Small business concern'' is defined in section II.F. of this notice. In determining whether an applicant is a small
business concern, an assessment will be made of several factors, including whether it is organized for profit, whether
it is independently owned and operated, and whether it meets the size requirement of 500 or fewer employees. Whether
the size requirement is met may depend on whether the applicant organization is affiliated with another organization
whose employees, when added to those of the applicant organization, exceed 500. In conducting this assessment, all
appropriate factors will be considered, including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affiliation exists when one concern controls or has the power to control the other, or there is third party control,
or an identity of interest between or among parties exists so that affiliation may be found. Control may be affirmative
or negative, and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the power to control exists. Indeed, control can
arise from a variety of circumstances. One example of a circumstance that could lead to a finding that an organization
is controlling, or has the power to control, another organization is the sharing of common office space, employees,
or other facilities (for example, laboratory space). Although access to special facilities or equipment in another
organization is permitted (as in cases in which the SBIR applicant has entered into a subcontractual agreement with
another institution for a specific, limited portion of the research project), research space occupied by an SBIR
applicant must be space that is not generally shared with another organization and over which the applicant has exclusive
control. When there is an indication of sharing of common employees, a determination will be made on a case- by-case
basis of whether the sharing constitutes control or the power to control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, control or the power to control is generally considered to exist when ``key employees of one concern
organize a new concern and serve as its officers, directors, principal stockholders, and/or key employees, and the
one concern is furnishing or will furnish the other concern with subcontracting financial or technical assistance,
bid or performance bond indemnification, and/or other facilities, whether for a fee or otherwise.'' Affiliation
can also arise between or among two or more persons when an identity of interest exists, such as members of the same family
or persons with common investments in more than one concern.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All SBIR grant applications will be reviewed with the above considerations in mind. Organizations considering submitting
an application are referred to the SBIR Program Policy Directive published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6144) and to the regulations set forth at 13 CFR part 121 for further guidance regarding eligibility.
In particular, to determine whether affiliation exists, the applicant should also refer to 13 CFR 121.401 for the
definition of affiliation, which will be used as HCFA's guide on this matter. If it appears that an applicant organization
does not meet eligibility requirements with respect to size, HCFA will request a size determination of the organization
from the applicable Small Business Administration (SBA) regional office. The review of the application for scientific
merit may be deferred until a definitive response is furnished by SBA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of particular concern in considering grant awards is the position of principal investigator. We wish to ensure that
support is furnished to a carefully directed working group led by an individual personally committed to the development
of the innovation. Accordingly, we are adopting the ``principal investigator'' concept from 42 CFR part 52. These
regulations define the term ``principal investigator'' to mean ``a single individual designated by the grantee
in the grant application .&blank;.&blank;. who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the
project.'' (42 CFR 52.2.) In order to meet this standard, the principal investigator's primary employment must be
with the grantee at the time of the award and remain so for the duration of the project. Primary employment means that
more than one-half of the principal investigator's time is spent in the employment of the small business concern.
Primary employment with a small business concern precludes full-time employment at another organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6144), we have further restricted the definition of primary employment of the principal
investigator to accurately reflect HCFA's needs. The applicant must declare the principal investigator's employment,
whether paid or unpaid, at the time of application, and must declare all employment relationships, whether paid or
unpaid, that the principal investigator is expected to have at the time the SBIR grant awards are expected to be made
and for the duration of the proposed project. In the event that, at the time of application, the principal investigator_(1)
is, or expects to be, a less-than-full-time employee of the small business concern, (2) is, or expects to be, concurrently
employed by another organization, or (3) gives, or expects that he or she may give, the appearance of being concurrently
employed by another organization, whether for a paid or unpaid position, it is essential that documentation be submitted
with the application to verify the applicant's eligibility at the time of the award. Thus, if the principal investigator
is also employed or appears to be employed by an institution other than the applicant organization (for example, a
university, nonprofit research institute, or a company other than the applicant organization), a letter must be
furnished by the nonapplicant organization confirming that the principal investigator, if awarded an SBIR grant,
is, or will become, a less-than-half-time employee of the organization and will remain so for the duration of the SBIR
project. If the principal investigator is employed by a university, the letter must be furnished by the dean of the
school or the departmental chairperson. If the principal investigator is employed by another for-profit organization,
the letter must be signed by a corporate official. This documentation of the primary employment of the principal investigator
is required for every application that is submitted, even one that is a revision of a previously submitted application.
In the event that solicitation of this documentation would place the principal investigator's current employment
in jeopardy should the grant award not be made, the applicant may delay submission of the documentation, provided
the documentation is submitted no later than 30 days after receiving notice of a grant award, and provided that the
applicant includes a statement with the grant application to the effect that solicitation of the documentation at
this time would place the principal investigator's current employment in jeopardy, that the applicant will forward
the documentation within 30 days of receiving notice of a grant award, and that the applicant understands that should
it fail to provide the documentation, we may, at our discretion, immediately suspend or terminate the grant. If the
principal investigator fails to furnish adequate documentation, the application may be returned without review.
In the event a grantee is required to submit documentation of the principal investigator's employment, but fails
to do so within 30 days of the date of the notice of grant award, we may immediately suspend or terminate the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both Phase I and Phase II, the research or R&amp;D must be performed in its entirety in the United States (U.S.),
that is, the States, territories, and possessions of the U.S.; the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana
Islands; and the District of Columbia.

II. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The words and phrases that appear on the SBIR application form, or are needed in the application narrative, are not
readily defined. Therefore, for convenience and clarity, we have furnished the following definitions, which, except
as noted, are taken from SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive that implements this program and was published on January
26, 1993, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 6144). This policy directive requires an agency to define in a separate section whatever terms it uses that are
unique to either the SBIR Program, a specific SBIR solicitation, or a portion of the solicitation. The section must
also include, at a minimum, specific terms as defined in the policy directive. Accordingly, in addition to the terms
required by the policy directive, we are also defining the terms ``Contract'' and ``Grant'' and including the policy
directive's definition of the term ``Research and Development.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``contract'' is an award instrument establishing a binding legal procurement relationship between a funding agency
and the recipient, obligating the latter to furnish an end product or service and binding the agency to furnish payment
for the product or service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``grant'' is a financial assistance mechanism whereby either money or direct assistance, or both, is furnished
to carry out approved activities.

may be found. Control can be exercised through common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business concerns include, but are not limited to, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual, partnership, corporation, joint venture, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association, or cooperative.

G. Subcontract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``subcontract'' is any agreement, other than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving an employer-employee relationship, entered into by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Federal government funding agreement awardee calling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies or services required solely for the performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original funding agreement.

IV. Submission of Grant Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant applications must be submitted to the HCFA Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer (see the ADDRESSES section of this notice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following schedule applies to the receipt, review, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and award of SBIR applications:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Receipt date_December 9, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical review_January 17, 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Award decisions_February 10, 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximate award date_February 17, 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications must be received by December 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications mailed through the U.S. Postal Service or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial delivery service will be ``on time'' if they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received or postmarked on or before December 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Submissions by facsimile (fax) transmission will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted. Applications that do not meet the above criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be considered late applications. Respondents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cautioned that if their application is late, it will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned without review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Method of Selection and Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All Phase I and Phase II grant applications will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated and judged on a competitive basis. Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be screened, and those found to be inadequate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review or programmatically unrelated to HCFA's mission will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be returned to the applicant. Those passing the screening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be reviewed for technical and scientific merit. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application will be judged individually, as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. HCFA is under no obligation to fund any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application or make any specific number of awards in a given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topic area. It may also elect to fund no projects within a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given topic area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Review Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant applications are subject to a review process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving two sequential steps. The first step is performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a technical review panel composed primarily of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and non-Federal professionals selected for their competence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in particular fields. The task of the panel is to evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for scientific and technical merit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewers furnish a number rating, make an overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation, and, on occasion, make highly specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations related to the scope, direction, and conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed research. The second level of review is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the senior management of HCFA's ORD. ORD management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions are based on judgments about not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical merit of the proposed research, but also its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevance to our mission. Generally, HCFA may award a grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if the corresponding application has been recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for approval by the panel. However, applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended for approval are not automatically funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Review Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering the scientific and technical merit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each application, the following criteria and weights will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The soundness and technical merit of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach_35 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The potential of the research for technological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovation including the potential for commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application_30 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The qualifications of the proposed principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigator, support staff, and consultant_20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The appropriateness of the budget_10 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The adequacy and suitability of the facilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research environment_5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When making funding decisions, ORD takes into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the following: (1) ratings resulting from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical evaluation process, (2) program relevance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Release of Grant Application Review Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following decisions on grant applications, summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements are mailed with a disapproval letter to principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigators whose proposals have not been accepted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Submission of Similar Grant Applications by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant Organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA discourages the submission of more than one grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application submitted by the same applicant organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with essentially the same research focus: That is, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product or technology that, with nonsubstantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications, can be applied to a variety of purposes. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating groupings of applications with a common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific focus or objective, technical review groups are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a position to easily identify multiple grant applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the same organization for essentially the same project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In these cases, HCFA will give funding consideration to only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive (58 FR 6144) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies that we furnish the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Awards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;There will be approximately 10 to 15 Phase I and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase II awards in FY '95. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The SBA Program Policy Directive permits the payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a reasonable fee or profit under the SBIR program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grantee organization will be required to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short quarterly progress reports, a complete draft final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report, and a final report. Additionally, a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status report (SF&hyph;269A) must be submitted to the HCFA Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer annually. The award will specify the schedule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reports and place of delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Payment Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once an SBIR grant is awarded, the grantee organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will receive information and forms regarding requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash, manner of payment, and associated reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Payment may be made on a cost-reimbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or advance basis. Cost reimbursements may be requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly, quarterly, or at other periodic intervals. Advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments may be requested on a monthly basis only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Limited Rights Information and Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proprietary Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information contained in an unfunded grant application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will remain the property of the applicant. HCFA may, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, retain copies of all applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If proprietary information is provided by a proposer in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a proposal that constitutes a trade secret, proprietary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial or financial information, confidential personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information or data affecting the national security, it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be treated in confidence, to the extent permitted by law, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided this information is clearly marked by the proposer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the term ``confidential proprietary information'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided the following legend appears on the title page of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this data shall not be disclosed outside the government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole or in part, provided that if a funding agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is awarded to this proposer as a result of or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with the submission of this data, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclose the data to the extent provided in the funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. This restriction does not limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government's right to use information contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data if it is obtained from another source without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restriction. The data subject to this restriction are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in pages 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any other legend may be unacceptable to the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government and may constitute grounds for removing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal from further consideration and without assuming any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability for inadvertent disclosure. The government will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit dissemination of the information to official channels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Title to Property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title to real property, equipment, and supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquired by a for-profit recipient under a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance award or subaward will vest, upon acquisition, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal government. However, the title may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred to the awardee upon termination of the project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the transfer would be more cost-effective than our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the property. It is recommended that applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider leasing arrangements whenever possible. HCFA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally not fund projects that require the acquisition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
real property, equipment, or supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Rights in Data Developed Under the SBIR Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rights in data, including software developed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of any grant resulting from an application submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in response to this notice will remain with the grantee, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that the Federal government will have the limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to use the data for internal Federal government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. These data will not be released outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal government without permission of the grantee for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of 4 years from completion of the project from which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data were generated. However, at the end of this 4-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period a royalty-free license will exist for HCFA to use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to authorize others to use on its behalf, these data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal government purposes. At this time, HCFA is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relieved of all disclosure prohibitions and assumes no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability for unauthorized use of these data by third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties. This notice will be affixed to any reproductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these data, in whole or in part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With prior written permission of the Grants Officer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the awardee may normally copyright and publish (consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with appropriate national security considerations, if any) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material developed with HCFA's support. HCFA receives a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
royalty-free license for the Federal government and requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that each publication contain an appropriate acknowledgment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of agency support and a disclaimer statement.

Small business concerns may normally retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with HCFA support. The Federal government receives a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
royalty-free license for Federal government use, reserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to require the patentholder to license others in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain circumstances, and requires that anyone exclusively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensed to sell the invention in the U.S. must normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture it substantially in the U.S. To the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized by 35 U.S.C. 205, the government will not make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public any information disclosing a government-supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invention for a 4-year period to allow the awardee a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable time to pursue a patent.

E. Profit or Fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Absent a statutory prohibition, payment of a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee or profit will be made under the SBIR program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 6144). Because the regulations set forth at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45 CFR 74.705, which provide that no profit or fee will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to for-profit organizations through grants, do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invoke a statutory prohibition on paying a fee or profit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SBA's policy directive applies to these SBIR grants.

I. Cost Sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cost sharing is not required nor will it be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation factor in consideration of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, due to the special nature of the SBIR Program, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant may choose to share the costs of a project. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be done through cash or in-kind contributions. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently, we expect that the applicant will contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more labor or use unreimbursed equipment as the applicant's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
share.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice is intended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informational purposes and reflects current planning. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is any inconsistency between the information contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this notice and the terms of any resulting SBIR grant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terms of the grant are controlling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before award of an SBIR grant, HCFA may request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant to submit certain organization, management, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel, and financial information in order to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal government is not responsible for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monies expended by the applicant before the award of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is not an offer by HCFA and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligate HCFA to make any specific number of awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SBIR Program is not a substitute for HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing unsolicited proposal mechanisms, and unsolicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals will not be accepted under either Phase I or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase II of the SBIR Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant may be required to certify that he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not previously been paid, nor is currently being paid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for essentially equivalent work by an agency of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. If a grant is made under this notice for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project, some of whose elements are being supported, or will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be supported, by another Federal agency, HCFA and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant will negotiate a budget that reflects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination of any overlapping support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This program is not covered by Executive Order 12372, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Intergovernment Review of Federal Programs.'' Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12372 provides for a State clearinghouse in each State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to review Federal programs. Research grants are exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this review.

VII. Research Topic Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice invites SBIR Phase I applications in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following areas. The topics are defined in general terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They are intended to indicate where we believe we can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly offer assistance in the development of innovative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology. ORD will consider any idea that is within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general subject of a topic. In addition, ORD will review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any idea that is within the general purview of HCFA, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section I. of this notice. Applicants are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reminded that the overall intent of the HCFA SBIR Program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide assistance to the development of products and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes that have commercial potential and not to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquisition of products for HCFA's own use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. High Quality and Effective Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA invites ideas that would develop products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist all participants in health care in assessing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring the quality of care and level of care being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to patients. Projects should aim to develop tools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for health care professionals, providers, and managers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit them to examine patterns of services being delivered, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the health and social outcome of those services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects that would assist private organizations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing patient guidelines and in conducting technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments are of interest. These tools should provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way to monitor and measure the delivery of health services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the outcomes of those services. They should also make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible a judgment about the quality of the care, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the care, or both. The technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency with which care is delivered and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness of the overall outcome for the patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Management of Ambulatory Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA invites ideas that would develop tools to monitor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess, and control overutilization and underutilization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambulatory services and products at all levels of the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care system. Apart from the inflation in the cost of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service, a significant cause of the rising cost of health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care services is excessive utilization. Traditionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilization review techniques have been applied to high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost, acute services, such as surgery and hospitalizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We wish to focus on physician services and other ambulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services and products, for example, drugs, medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, and testing. HCFA invites applications related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to services or products commonly associated with Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients, who are primarily the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aged, the poor, the disabled, and persons with end-stage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renal disease. Techniques to be explored involve systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both for retrospective utilization pattern review and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
managing prospective interventions in individual physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or beneficiary and recipient service or product use. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area also includes broader management tools, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information derived from utilization review, that promote or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure more efficient and effective service delivery.

C. Beneficiary Information and Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA invites ideas that may make the Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid programs understandable to beneficiaries and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients and that provide assistance to these individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their attempts to deal with the programs. Potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program users (Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients) need to understand when they are eligible, what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services or products are covered, and what their rights and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities are within each program. An example would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be an information project that would assist health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers, including Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients, by providing aggregate data on provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance and utilization trends, discrete price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, and information on related copayments, etc.; in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a sense, a ``Blue Book for Consumers.'' Another example is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining payment for claims, one of the most frequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems encountered by Medicare beneficiaries. The process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dealing with Medicare's fiscal intermediaries and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers is difficult for many. Tools that would ease this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process would be welcome. Beneficiaries also need to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to decide whether they should join, or exit from, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health maintenance organization, and the advantages and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantages of the decision. Beneficiaries need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand what considerations to take into account when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long term care is a possibility. Similarly, beneficiaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be assisted in the decision about the purchase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health insurance in addition to Medicare. HCFA invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideas in beneficiary communication and assistance approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are tailored to special populations (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant demographic, sociocultural, or disease-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups of beneficiaries), as well as approaches that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used by supplemental health benefit program sponsors (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, employers and unions) in assisting Medicare-eligible retirees. Applicants who are considering this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topic should understand that the SBIR Program generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeks to support the development of commercially viable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and that there is already a fair amount of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial activity in this area.

D. Program Efficiencies and Improvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing systems for health care delivery and financing have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, changes
due to new technology, legislation, regulation, and market forces. Major payers for health care are continually
studying the feasibility of new approaches to improving the management of care, the delivery of care, and financing.
Therefore, HCFA invites applications that focus on tools to assist in the goal of improved management of the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. The term management is used in a broad sense. These could be tools that are directed toward providers
who furnish services or products to Medicare beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients, organizations that handle the
financing of care, organizations that oversee the quality of services and products, or the beneficiaries and recipients
themselves, and State and local organizations that deal primarily with Medicare and Medicaid populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA will consider any innovative idea that appears to have the potential for improving the programs for any of the
several parties involved, and that has a potential for sale in the normal or commercial market. An example of an innovative
idea is the development of improved computer- based case management systems for community care services. Case management
programs are commonly being used to coordinate community-based care for frail elderly and other populations under
Medicaid and other programs. Automated systems use client eligibility and assessment information to assist case
management agencies in preparing appropriate plans of care based on the client's condition and select service providers.
These systems would also interface with service approval or financial or billing systems to improve the cost-efficiency
of case management programs. Proposed systems should complement or integrate existing mandated HCFA instruments
(particularly functional assessment tools, minimum data sets, discharge planning, etc.). Redundant instruments
will not be considered for funding.

. This set of national health objectives was first published in 1990. As the midpoint of the decade approaches, new
science, new data, and new information are available to be incorporated into the nation's prevention agenda. The
revisions take the form of proposed new objectives, new special population subobjectives, changes in language,
and target revisions. The proposals reflect the availability of new information or scientific findings on prevention
and new data indicating disparities in health status among special populations. The proposed revisions are printed
within the context of the Healthy People 2000 objectives published in 1990.

Description of the Need for the Information and its Proposed Use:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this information collection is to have projects administered under the public housing, Indian housing,
and Section 8 Certificate, Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs submit certain data electronically
to HUD in a HUD prescribed format. For housing agencies (HAs) that are not already automated or who determine that automation
is not cost-effective, transmission of the data through the use of a service bureau is permitted. Electronic transmission
is necessary because the manual submission of HUD forms has become a burden to HAs and to HUD.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;9 and NPF&hyph;17, issued to the Duke Power Company,
licensee for the McGuire Nuclear Station Units 1 and 2. The plants are located at the licensee's site in Mecklenburg,
County, North Carolina. The exemption was requested by the licensee by letter dated June 28, 1994, and supplemented
by letters dated August 18, 1994 and September 7, 1994.

Indentification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action requests an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 50.60, ``Acceptance Criteria for Fracture
Prevention Measures for Light-Water Nuclear Power Reactors for Normal Operation,'' to allow application of an alternate
methodology to determine the low temperature overpressure protection (LTOP) setpoint for the McGuire Nuclear Station
Units 1 and 2. The proposed alternate methodology is consistent with guidelines developed by the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Working Group on Operating Plant Criteria (WGOPC) to define pressure limits during
LTOP events that avoid certain unnecessary operational restrictions, provide adequate margins against failure
of the reactor pressure vessel, and reduce the potential for unnecessary activation of pressure-relieving devices
used for LTOP. These guidelines have been incorporated into Code Case N&hyph;514, ``Low Temperature Overpressure
Protection,'' which has been approved by the ASME Code Committee. The content of this code case has been incorporated
into Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda to Section XI. The NRC staff is revising
10 CFR 50.55a, which will endorse the 1993 Addenda and Appendix G of Section XI into the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The philosophy used to develop Code Case N&hyph;514 guidelines is to ensure that the LTOP limits are still below the
pressure/temperature (P/T) limits for normal operation, but allow the pressure that may occur with activation of
pressure-relieving devices to exceed the P/T limits, provided acceptable margins are maintained during these events.
This philosophy protects the pressure vessel from LTOP events, and still maintains the Technical Specification
P/T limits applicable for normal heatup and cooldown in accordance with Appendix G to 10 CFR Part 50 and Section III
and XI of the ASME Code.

The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR 50.60 states that all light-water nuclear power reactors must meet the fracture toughness and material surveillance
program requirements for the reactor coolant pressure boundary as set forth in Appendices G and H to 10 CFR Part 50.
Appendix G to 10 CFR 50 defines P/T limits during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational
occurrences and system hydrostatic tests, to which the pressure boundary may be subjected over its service lifetime.
10 CFR 50.60(b) specifies that alternatives to the described requirements in Appendices G and H to 10 CFR Part 50 may
be used when an exemption is granted by the Commission under 10 CFR 50.12

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent transients that would produce pressure excursions exceeding the Appendix G P/T limits while the reactor
is operating at low temperatures, the licensee installed an LTOP system. The LTOP system includes pressure relieving
devices in the form of Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) that are set at a pressure low enough that if a transient
occurred while the coolant temperature is below the LTOP enabling temperature, they would prevent the pressure on
the reactor vessel from exceeding the Appendix G P/T limits. To prevent these valves from lifting as a result of normal
operating pressure surges (e.g., reactor coolant pump starting, and shifting operating charging pumps) with the
reactor coolant system in a water solid condition, the operating pressure must be maintained below the PORV setpoint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in order to prevent cavitation of a reactor coolant pump, the operator must maintain a differential pressure
across the reactor coolant pump seals. Hence, the licensee must operate the plant in a pressure window that is defined
as the difference between the minimum required pressure to start a reactor coolant pump and the operating margin to
prevent lifting of the PORVs due to normal operating pressure surges. The licensee LTOP analysis indicates that using
the Appendix G safety margins to determine the PORV setpoint would result in a pressure setpoint within its operating
window, but there would be no margin for normal operating pressure surges. Therefore, operating with these limits
could result in the lifting of the PORVs and cavitation of the reactor coolant pumps during normal operation. Therefore,
the licensee proposed that in determining the PORV setpoint for LTOP events for McGuire, the allowable pressure be
determined using the safety margins developed in an alternate methodology in lieu of the safety margins required
by Appendix G to 10 CFR Part 50. The alternate methodology is consistent with ASME Code Case N&hyph;514. The content
of this code case has been incorporated into Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda
to Section XI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exemption from 10 CFR 50.60 is required to use the alternate methodology for calculating the maximum allowable
pressure for LTOP considerations. By application dated June 28, as supplemented August 18, 1994 (and further clarified
by letter dated September 7, 1994), the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.60.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the licensee's application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix G of the ASME Code requires that the P/T limits be calculated: (a) Using a safety factor of 2 on the principal
membrane (pressure) stresses, (b) assuming a flaw at the surface with a depth of one-quarter (1/4) of the vessel wall
thickness and a length of six (6) times its depth, and (c) using a conservative fracture toughness curve that is based
on the lower bound of static, dynamic, and crack arrest fracture toughness tests on material similar to the McGuire
reactor vessel material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the PORV setpoint for LTOP events, the licensee proposed to use safety margins based on an alternate
methodology consistent with the proposed ASME Code Case N&hyph;514 guidelines. The ASME Code Case N&hyph;514 allows
determination of the setpoint for LTOP events such that the maximum pressure in the vessel would not exceed 110 percent
of the P/T limits of the existing ASME Appendix G. This results in a safety factor of 1.8 on the principal membrane stresses.
All other factors, including assumed flaw size and fracture toughness, remain the same. Although this methodology
would reduce the safety factor on the principal membrane stresses, use of the proposed criteria will provide adequate
margins of safety to the reactor vessel during LTOP transients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed change involves use of more realistic safety margins
for determining the PORV setpoint during LTOP events. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has
no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering amending Facility Operating License No.
NPF&hyph;86 issued to North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (North Atlantic) for the Seabrook Station, Unit
No. 1 (Seabrook). The facility is located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.

Identification of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would amend the Seabrook Technical Specifications (TS) to permit operation of the Seabrook core
with an expanded axial flux difference (AFD) band from that currently permitted. Operation with the expanded AFD
band would be supported by continuous monitoring of core power distribution using the fixed incore detector system.
Other TS changes would allow for fuel design enhancements. The changes to the TS include modification to a number of
safety analysis input parameters and assumptions as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Incorporation of Westinghouse WRB&hyph;1 departure from nucleate boiling correlation and revised thermal
design procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Increased core power distribution peaking factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allowance for positive moderator temperature coefficient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allowance for thimble plug deletion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allowance for increased steam generator tube plugging limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allowance for new fuel design features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Modification of analytical assumptions related to certain surveillance parameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Expansion of AFD band Limiting Condition for Operation.

The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes will allow operation of Seabrook with improved fuel cycle management and will permit North Atlantic
to implement certain new fuel design features in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action will allow for a significant improvement in fuel utilization. The number of fuel assemblies required
for an equilibrium core reload will decrease from 80 to 72. Thus, the major environmental effects of the proposed action
are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Less nuclear fuel will be required for the reactor core thereby reducing the environmental impacts associated
with mining, converting, enriching, and transporting uranium,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Fewer fuel assemblies will be required for the reactor core reloads thereby reducing the environmental impacts
associated with fabricating and transporting fuel assemblies,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Fewer spent fuel assemblies will be produced reducing the amount of spent fuel storage space required, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Fewer spent fuel assemblies will need to be managed in long-term storage or disposed of in licensed repositories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has evaluated the environmental impact of the proposed action and has determined that neither the
probability of accidents nor the post-accident radiological releases would be great than previously determined.
Further, the Commission has determined that the proposed approval would not affect routine radiological plant effluents
and would not increase occupational radiological exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are
no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed approval does involve features located entirely
within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has
no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded that the environmental effects of the proposed action are not significant, any
alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested approval. This would not reduce the environmental impact
attributable to the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
Related to Operation of the Seabrook Station, Units 1 and 2, dated December 1974.

The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne Light Company, Ohio Edison Company,
Pennsylvania Power Company, and, Toledo Edison Company (the licensees) hold Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;58,
which authorizes operation of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant (PNPP), Unit No. 1. The license provides, among other
things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the
Commission) now or hereafter in effect. This facility is a boiling water reactor located on the shore of Lake Erie in
Lake County, Ohio, approximately 35 miles northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, and approximately 23 miles southwest of
Ashtabula, Ohio.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (a) of 10 CFR 70.24, ``Criticality Accident Requirements,'' requires that each licensee authorized
to possess special nuclear material shall maintain in each area where such material is handled, used, or stored, an
appropriate criticality monitoring system. In accordance with Subsection (a)(1) of 10 CFR 70.24, coverage of all
such areas at PNPP, Unit No. 1, shall be provided by two criticality detectors. However, exemptions may be requested
pursuant to 10 CFR 70.24(d), provided that the licensee believes that good cause exists for the exemption. In particular,
Regulatory Guide 8.12, Revision 2, ``Criticality Accident Alarm System,'' states that it is appropriate to request
an exemption from 10 CFR 70.24 if an evaluation determines that a potential for criticality does not exist, as for example
where geometric spacing is used to preclude criticality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated February 28, 1992, the license requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 70.24. A previous
exemption from the provisions of 10 CFR 70.24 for the storage of special nuclear material, including reactor fuel
assemblies (maximum amount of 2,602 kg of U&hyph;235 in uranium enriched to no more than 3.00 weight percent (w/o)),
was granted to PNPP in NRC Material License No. SNM&hyph;1928. The materials license was issued on March 7, 1985, and
expired upon conversion of the construction permit to an operating license on November 13, 1986. The bases for the
current exemption request is the same as for the original 1985 request. Specifically, the licensees proposed to handle
and store unirradiated fuel in the fuel handling building in the new fuel pool without having a criticality monitoring
system with two separate criticality detectors as required by 10 CFR 70.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bases for the exemption is that the potential for accident critically is precluded because of the geometric spacing
of fuel in the storage pool and administrative controls imposed in fuel handling procedures from the time the fuel
is removed from approved shipping containers, until it is placed in specially designed storage racks. Administrative
control encompass placing the assemblies in the fuel inspection stand, receipt inspection activities, and lifting
and placement of the assemblies into specified locations into the new fuel storage vaults. Design of the new fuel racks
precludes criticality, i.e., an effective multiplication factor of 0.95 or less in the normal dry condition or abnormal
completely water flooded condition. Criticality during optimal moderation (foam, small droplets, spray, or fogging)
is precluded by storing new fuel assemblies in the new fuel vaults in alternate rows and columns. Administrative controls
will prevent placement of each fuel assembly in adjacent storage cells. Restrictions on this exemption ensure that
personnel are trained, equipment is operable, an assembly storage plan is developed, reviewed, and approved, and
verification is undertaken by the Reactor Engineer or licensed Senior Reactor Operator at the completion of each
fuel assembly transfer to ensure criticality is precluded. These restrictions are listed in the enclosure as items
1, 2, 3, and 4. Restriction 5 requires performing and maintaining criticality analyses documenting that the maximum
effective multiplication factor for each fuel assembly does not exceed 0.95 when optimally moderated and fully reflected
by water. Restriction 6 limits maximum fuel enrichment to 5 w/o of U&hyph;235 independent of the results of analyses
performed in accordance with Restriction 5. Fuel assemblies, when stored in their shipping containers, shall be
stacked no more than three containers high (Restriction 7). No more than three fuel assemblies shall be outside their
shipping containers or storage racks at any one time (Restriction 8). The minimum edge-to-edge distance between
the group of three fuel assemblies and all other fuel assemblies shall be 12 inches (Restriction 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the information provided, there is reasonable assurance that unirradiated fuel will remain subcritical
because of the new fuel pool design and administrative controls. The special circumstances for granting an exemption
to 10 CFR 70.24 are met because criticality is precluded with the present design configuration, Technical Specification
requirements, and the restrictions placed upon the exemption. Therefore, the staff concludes that the licensee's
request for an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 70.24 for unirradiated fuel in the fuel handling building
is acceptable and should be granted. This exemption is subject to the restrictions listed in the enclosure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 70.24, an exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described in Section II above from 10 CFR 70.24, ``Criticality
Accident Requirements,'' such that the licensee is exempt from providing two criticality detectors. This exemption
is subjection to the restrictions in the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 47363).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 15, 1994, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published changes to four existing system notices (59 FR
30817). The routine uses added to OPM/Central&hyph;10 (Directory of Federal Executive Institute Alumni) and OPM/Central&hyph;11
(Presidential Management Intern Program Records) by that publication allowed disclosure of names and home address
of participants and alumni of the programs to other program participants and alumni.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that the Federal Executive Institute already obtains consent for disclosure directly from
the individuals involved, and the Presidential Management Intern program will establish a similar procedure for
release of such data. Therefore, routine uses to cover disclosure of the information are not necessary, and routine
use ``m'' added to OPM/Central&hyph;10 and routine use ``n'' added to OPM/Central&hyph;11 are hereby rescinded.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Storage of Customer Account Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
September 23, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, paragraph (c) of CBOE Rule 9.8, ``Supervision of Accounts,'' provides that background and financial
information of customers who have been approved for options transactions must be maintained at both the branch office
servicing the customer's account and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch office.
In addition, copies of options customer account statements over the most recent six months must be maintained at both
the branch office supervising the accounts and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over that branch.
The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 9.8(c) and Interpretation and Policy .03 to enable members' supervisory offices
to maintain certain customer account information at off-site locations as long as the records are readily accessible
and promptly retrievable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to enable supervisory offices of CBOE members to store certain customer
account records off-site. CBOE members that elect to do so must ensure that the records are easily accessible and promptly
retrievable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, under CBOE Rule 9.8, background and financial information about customers, as well as copies of customer
account statements, must be maintained at the branch office serving the customer and at that branch's principal supervisory
office. The substance of this rule appears uniformly in the rules of the other options exchanges and in the options
account rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). According to the CBOE, on-site
storage in major financial centers is expensive, and, in today's market environment, automated and secure facilities
for data storage and retrieval make it unnecessary to require on-site storage. The CBOE states that, given those realities,
the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 has recommended that record retention requirements be relaxed and that the exchanges and the NASD amend their rules
to permit supervisory offices to store customer records off-premises as a matter of routine practice.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OSRC, which was created pursuant to a plan submitted by the options exchanges under Rule 17d&hyph;2 (``17d&hyph;2
plan'') under the Act, includes representatives from each of the registered options exchanges and the NASD. The 17d&hyph;2
plan was developed by the exchanges and approved by the Commission to reduce regulatory duplication and to coordinate
solutions to options-related sales practice issues common to firms which are members of two or more self-regulatory
organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In connection with the OSRC's recommendation, the designated options examining authorities, including the CBOE,
have committed to periodic examinations of the document retention and supervisory practices of firms using off-site
storage arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE concurs with the OSRC's recommendation and believes that its proposal will afford the CBOE's members the
opportunity to discharge their supervisory responsibilities more efficiently and more cost-effectively. Accordingly,
the CBOE's proposal amends paragraph (c) and Interpretation and Policy .03 of CBOE Rule 9.8 to enable CBOE members'
supervisory offices to use off-premises storage for certain of the customer records specified in the rules, provided
the records are easily accessible and promptly retrievable.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Interpretation and Policy .03 requires member to maintain, at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction
over the office servicing a customer's account, information to permit review of each customer's account to determine
(1) the compatibility of options transactions with investment objectives and with the types of transactions for
which the account was approved; (2) the size and frequency of options transactions; (3) commission activity in the
account; (4) profit or loss in the account; (5) undue concentration in any options class or classes and (6) compliance
with the provisions of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 9, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

Commentary .01 to PSE Rule 6.82, ``Lead Market Maker Pilot Program,'' states that the PSE's Lead Market Maker (``LMM'')
system pilot program will expire on September 30, 1994. The PSE proposes to amend Commentary .01 to extend the Exchange's
LMM system pilot program through September 30, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the PSE and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 17, 1990, the Commission approved the PSE's LMM system on a pilot basis.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Previously, the Commission has approved Exchange requests for extension of the pilot program,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 which is set to expire on September 30, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The PSE submitted pilot program reports to the Commission on September 18, 1992, and on July 26, 1993. In addition,
on April 20, 1994, the Exchange withdrew several pending rule filings relating to the LMM program and did so with the
intention of resubmitting a consolidated filing at a later date.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 At this time, the PSE is considering additional rule changes to be included in the consolidated filing. Therefore,
the Exchange proposes to amend its rules to extend the LMM pilot program through September 30, 1995, in order to provide
additional time for evaluation of the LMM program in light of any changes that may be approved within the next year.

Basis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PSE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will promote just and equitable principles of trade and
contribute to the protection of investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PSE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposal to extend the LMM pilot program through September 30, 1995, is consistent with
the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission concludes, as it did in approving the LMM pilot program, that the pilot program may enhance the market
making mechanism on the PSE, thereby improving the markets for listed options on the Exchange. Specifically, the
Commission believes that the LMM pilot may improve the PSE's market making capabilities by creating long-term commitments
to options classes. Moreover, the pilot program will continue with adequate due process safeguards in the LMM selection
and termination procedures and will retain procedures that prevent the misuse of material non-public LMM information
by either an LMM or a broker-dealer affiliated with an LMM. The Commission notes, however, that before the pilot program
can be approved on a permanent basis, the PSE must provide the Commission with a report on the operation of the pilot
program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, before requesting permanent approval or further extension of the pilot program the PSE must submit
a pilot program report by June 1995 that addresses: (1) whether there have been any complaints regarding the operation
of the pilot; (2) whether the PSE has taken any disciplinary or performance action against any member due to the operation
of the pilot; (3) the number of LMMs involved in the pilot; (4) the extent to which the pilot has been used on the PSE; (5)
whether the PSE has terminated or replaced an LMM and the reasons therefore; (6) the impact of the pilot on the bid/ask
spreads, depth and continuity in PSE options markets; and (7) whether the PSE has taken any action or there have been
any complaints against LMMs or associated broker-dealers relating to improper activity as a result of LMM affiliations
with upstairs firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 because the PSE has not indicated that there have been any problems associated with the operation of the LMM system
pilot program and because the Commission has not received any adverse comments concerning the pilot program. In addition,
the Commission believes good cause exists to approve the extension of the LMM pilot program on an accelerated basis
in order to allow the pilot program to continue uninterrupted. The Commission believes, therefore, that granting
accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate and consistent with Section 6 of the Act.

Currently, PHLX Rule 1001 establishes a position limit of 100,000 contracts for FCOs traded on the PHLX. The PHLX proposes
to amend Exchange Rules 1001 and 1002 to increase the position and exercise limits for FCOs, including cross-rate
FCOs.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, under proposed Commentary .05(b) to PHLX rule 1001, the PHLX proposes to establish a position limit
of 150,000 contracts for FCOs with annual trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts, based upon the previous
year's volume. At the beginning of each calendar year, the PHLX will review FCO volume information from the previous
year to determine which limit will apply; a higher limit will be effective on the date set by the Exchange, and a lower
limit will take effect on the Monday following the mid-month June expiration. If the PHLX's beginning-of-the-year
FCO trading volume review indicates that the position limit for an FCO must be lowered from 150,000 contracts to 100,000
contracts, the PHLX will promptly notify FCO participants that the lower limit will be effective for all series in
that option on the Monday following the mid-month June expiration, and FCO participants will be required to comply
with the lower limit.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the PHLX's Market Surveillance Department plans to monitor trading volume on a monthly basis, so that
FCOs will be eligible immediately for a higher position limit when annual trading volume, as measured from the beginning
of the calendar year, exceeds the levels established in the proposal.

In order to implement the proposal prior to the end of 1994, the PHLX plans to conduct a one-time review of FCO volume,
calculating volume for the 12-month period immediately preceding approval of the proposal, so that FCOs with annual
trading volume during that period of at least 3,500,000 contracts will be eligible for the 150,000-contract limit
immediately after approval of the proposal.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The PHLX states that for the 12-month period from September 1993&hyph;August 1994, the Deutsche mark and the French
franc would qualify for the higher limit.

The PHLX notes that the Exchange's exercise limits are established by reference to position limits, so that any increase
in position limits will also increase exercise limits. Accordingly, the PHLX proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1002
to reflect the proposed amendment to Exchange Rule 1001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange views the current FCO position and exercise limits as too low in light of increased levels of trading activity
in the underlying currency markets and the resultant growth in liquidity of PHLX FCOs in recent years. The PHLX's proposal
is designed to identify and accommodate those active currencies where heavier trading and open interest warrant
higher limits. The PHLX understands that if it were to begin trading a new currency, measurement of the new currency's
trading volume for purposes of establishing its eligibility for the 150,000-contract limit would be calculated
from the beginning of the ``calendar year.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When FCOs began trading on the PHLX in 1982, FCO position limits were set at 10,000 contracts.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Since that time the position limits have been changed three times, including an increase to the current level of 100,000
contracts in 1986.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Since 1986, the PHLX has added several new products for which position limits are aggregated with other trading in
the same underlying foreign currency.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, many traders have begun to regularly accumulate positions near existing limits, especially in certain
more active currencies. In those active currencies, the PHLX believes that trading interest could migrate to the
over-the-counter (``OTC'') market, hampering PHLX liquidity if large traders continue to be restricted by the current
position limits.

The PHLX notes that since the time of the most recent increase in position limits, the size of the underlying currency
market has grown exponentially.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Since 1986, average daily trading volume in PHLX FCOs has grown from 30,880 to 48,246 contracts in 1992.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 As of February 1993, average daily volume was 61,062 contracts. Monthly volume and open interest have also increased
dramatically since 1986, especially in certain FCOs. Further, the highest monthly open interest in FCOs reached
995,941 in 1986; 1,188,570 contracts in 1987; 1,190,389 contracts in 1992; and 1,338,458 in 1993. Total annual volume
has increased from 7,905,239 contracts in 1986 to 12,158,069 contracts in 1992 to 13,101,365 contracts in 1993. Total
FCO trading volume as of July 1994 was 5,755,939 contracts.

In light of these market changes, the PHLX believes that increased position and exercise limits are necessary to add
depth and liquidity to the market. Because of the large size of the underlying market in foreign currencies, the PHLX
does not believe that higher position and exercise limits will increase manipulative concerns. Moreover, the Exchange
believes that these increases are particularly appropriate because the FCO market attracts a large number of institutional
and corporate investors who have substantial hedging needs and execute block-sized
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 transactions in FCOs.

Although the Exchange may grant position limit exemptions in the interest of fair and orderly markets, the Exchange
believes that it is more direct and logical to establish more appropriate position limits for all investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PHLX believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular,
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade as well as to protect
investors and the public interest. The PHLX believes that the increased depth and liquidity of the FCO market should
promote just and equitable principles of trade. In addition, the PHLX believes that the proposed approach to FCO position
limits should ensure that the applicable limit is reasonably related to trading volume. The PHLX believes that this,
in turn, should result in position limit levels that serve the purposes of protecting investors and the public interest
as well as preventing unfair acts and practices, such as manipulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal to raise the position limit for only those FCOs with annual
trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts should help to accommodate the needs of investors and market participants
while ensuring that the increased limits are only available for those currencies with extremely large and liquid
markets.

In this regard, the Commission believes, as it has stated in the past, that although position and exercise limits for
FCOs must be sufficient to protect the options and related markets from disruptions by manipulation, the limits must
not be established at levels that are so low as to discourage participation in the options market by institutions and
other investors with substantial hedging needs or to prevent market makers from adequately meeting their obligations
to maintain a fair and orderly market.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 In its proposal, the PHLX states that the FCO market attracts a large number of institutional and corporate investors
who have substantial needs and who execute block-sized transactions in FCOs. In addition, the PHLX believes that
trading in active currencies could migrate to the OTC market if traders continue to be restricted by the PHLX's current
FCO position limits. In light of the size of the FCO market and the needs of FCO investors and market makers, the Commission
believes that the PHLX's proposal is a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of market participants and to help
the Exchange remain competitive with the OTC market for FCOs.

At the same time, the Commission does not believe that the proposal significantly increases concerns regarding intermarket
manipulations or disruptions of the markets for FCOs or the underlying currencies. The Commission notes that the
interbank foreign currency spot market is an extremely large, diverse market comprised of banks and other financial
institutions worldwide.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 That market is supplemented by equally deep and liquid markets for standardized options and futures on foreign currencies
and options on those futures. An active OTC market also exists in FCOs. Given the probable expense of attempting to
affect the cash market for the currencies underlying the FCOs, the Commission believes that it would be difficult
for a market participant to manipulate the underlying cash market to benefit a previously established FCO position.

In addition, the Commission believes the proposal's requirement that FCOs have annual trading volume of 3,500,000
contracts to be eligible for the 150,000 contract limit further minimizes the potential for manipulations and helps
to ensure that only consistently active currencies will be eligible for the higher position limit. In this regard,
the Commission notes that if the PHLX's annual review of FCO trading volume indicates that an FCO is no longer eligible
for the higher position limit, then the lower limit will be effective in all series of the FCO effective the Monday following
the mid-month June expiration.

The Commission believes that the proposal's two-tiered approach to FCO position limits is consistent with the three-tiered
position limits for equity and narrow-based index options traded on the PHLX, and that tiering is consistent with
the evolutionary approach that the Commission and the options exchanges have adopted in increasing position and
exercise limits.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that the PHLX has had considerable experience monitoring the tiered framework in equity
options and narrow-based index options, and that differing position limits in those options have not created programming
or monitoring problems for securities firms, or led to significant customer confusion.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Based on the PHLX's experience with the three-tiered approach in equity and narrow-based index options, the Commission
believes the two-tiered approach for FCOs is appropriate.

Moreover, the absence of discernible manipulative problems under the current FCO position limit leads the Commission
to conclude that the proposed increase is warranted. The Commission recognizes, as it has stated in the past, that
there are no ideal limits in the sense that options positions of any given size can be stated conclusively to be free
of any manipulative concerns.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 The PHLX and the Commission, however, have relied largely on the absence of discernible manipulation or disruption
problems under the current limit as an indicator that additional increases can be safely considered. The Commission
believes for these reasons that the liberalization of existing FCO position and exercise limits under the condition
specified is appropriate.

The Commission continues to believe that proposals to increase position and exercise limits must be justified and
evaluated separately. After reviewing the proposed exercise limits, along with the eligibility criteria for the
higher tier, the Commission has concluded that the exercise limit increase does not raise manipulation problems
or increase concerns over market disruption in the underlying currencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Commission believes that the PHLX's surveillance programs will be adequate to detect and deter the
use of illegal position limits by market participants as well as detect and deter attempted manipulative activity
and other trading abuses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX, on a timely basis, to review annual FCO volume during the
year measured immediately prior to approval of the proposal in order to allow the Exchange to implement the higher
position limit for eligible FCOs prior to the end of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that Amendment No. 3 strengthens the PHLX's proposal by requiring that lower position limits
be implemented sooner than originally proposed, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, six months rather than up to two years, if an FCO's trading volume for the previous year is less than 3,500,000 contracts,
thereby helping to ensure that only actively traded currencies are eligible for the higher position limit. Accordingly,
the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 3 to the
proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

The proposed rule change to existing OFPA A&hyph;2 relates to the acceptance of contingency orders by Exchange specialists
(``Specialists''). The changes to part (ii), and the addition of part (iii), of OFPA A&hyph;2 would permit Specialists
to accept contingency orders currently forwarded through the Automated Options Market System (also known as ``AUTOM'')
without the requirement of approval by an Exchange floor official (``Floor Official''). Such contingency orders
would include those currently listed and defined in paragraph (c) of Phlx Rule 1066,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 as well as additional types of contingency orders that the Exchange is proposing to add to Rule 1066(c). In addition,
the Exchange is proposing to make changes to the fine schedule of OFPA A&hyph;2.

Phlx Rule 1066 generally sets forth certain types of orders, including contingency orders, market orders, and limit
orders. Paragraph (c) of Rule 1066 lists certain types of contingency orders, and specifically defines such orders.
Currently, the contingency orders currently listed and defined under paragraph (c) are stop (stop-loss) orders,
stop-limit orders, delta orders, and multi-part orders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Curently, a Specialist is prohibited under OFPA A&hyph;2 from accepting contingency orders, other than stop (stop-loss)
and stop-limit orders, without the express approval of a Floor Official.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed changes would make permissible the acceptance of contingency orders by Specialists without the approval
of a Floor Official. The change would extend the acceptance of certain contingency orders without floor official
approval beyond the currently permitted acceptance of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders to include contingency
orders as defined as such in Rule 1066(c), and will apply to both customer and broker-dealer accounts. Furthermore,
a Specialist would be able to refuse to accept contingency orders, but may only refuse to accept contingency orders
from customer accounts upon the prior approval of two Floor Officials.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds the amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2 permitting Specialists to accept contingency
orders, as defined in Phlx Rule 1066, without prior Floor Official approval, will remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by facilitating quicker and more efficient executions
of such contingency orders. While the Commission believes that it is permissible for Specialists to retain the ability
to refuse to accept contingency orders as market conditions necessitate, the Commission also believes that the proposed
amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2 requiring the express approval of two Floor Officials in order for a Specialist to refuse
to accept a contingency order from a customer account will serve to prevent Specialists from arbitrarily rejecting
such customer orders, and will thereby help to protect investors and the public interest. In this regard, the Commission
would expect the Phlx to monitor this area to assure that orders are not arbitrarily or unfairly being refused.

The Commission finds that the expansion of Phlx Rule 1066(c) to include four additional types of contingency orders
is consistent with the Act and the rules thereunder, as well as the rules of other self-regulatory organizations which
trade option products. Specifically, the definitions of all-or-none,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 opening-only-market,
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 and market-on-close
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 orders are consistent with the definitions contained in the rules of other options self-regulatory organizations,
all of which rules have been previously approved by the Commission. In addition, although not contained in the rules
of other self-regulatory organizations, the ability, or in some cases the responsibility, of Exchange members to
submit cancel-replacement orders in appropriate circumstances is set forth in Phlx OFPA A&hyph;7(b), which was
previously approved by the Commission.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30670 (May 6, 1992), 57 FR 20312 (May 12, 1992) (``Release No. 30670''). OFPA A&hyph;7(b)
states that in order to effect a change in the option series of an order placed on the Specialist book, a member shall
submit separate cancel and replacement orders to the Specialists. In order to effect a change in the price or volume
of an order placed on the Specialist book, a member may submit the appropriate cancel and replacement ticket or tickets
to the Specialist. In Release No. 30670, the Commission found that this provision ``served the needs of investors
and promotes investor confidence in the quality and integrity of the Phlx's options market by requiring specialists
to respond promptly to cancellation instructions and to indicate immediately that the cancellation was accepted
or that the cancellation was too late, and therefore, that the order was executed.'' In addition, the Commission found
that the provision ``will improve the execution of customer orders by providing an efficient procedure for submitting
changes in the terms of an order on the specialist's book.''

The Commission also finds that the proposed amendments to the definitions of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders
in Rule 1066(c) merely clarify the current definitions of those terms, and therefore present no new regulatory issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also finds that the amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2's fine schedule to increase the penalties for infractions
thereof will continue to provide a fair and effective means to enforce compliance with the provisions and thereby
promote just and equitable principles of trade and the protection of investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, OFPA A&hyph;2(ii) permits specialists to accept spread, straddle, or combination orders, as those terms
are defined in Phlx Rule 1066(d), (g) and (h), respectively with the express approval of one Floor Official. However,
because such orders are discretionary in nature, and Section 11(a) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 prohibits specialists from accepting discretionary orders, the Phlx has amended OFPA A&hyph;2 to prohibit specialists
from accepting such orders, regardless of Floor Official approval. Thus, the purpose of Amendment No. 4 is merely
to conform OFPA A&hyph;2 with the requirements and prohibitions of the Act, and necessarily serves to promote just
and equitable principles of trade and protect investors and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission finds
that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 4. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent
with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 4 on an accelerated basis.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant, a registered open-end investment company, has filed a declaration pursuant to rule 24f&hyph;2 under
the Act to register an indefinite amount of shares under the Securities Act of 1933.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. An investment company that has filed a declaration under rule 24f&hyph;2 must file annual notices with the SEC and
pay share registration fees for shares sold in the previous fiscal year. If the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice is filed within
two months after the close of the investment company's fiscal year, the amount of the registration fee is based on net
sales (new sales minus redemptions) in the year in question. If the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice is not filed within two months,
the registration fee is based on gross sales (with no credit for redemptions). At the latest, the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice
along with the appropriate registration fee must be filed within six months after the end of an investment company's
fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. ACM's fiscal year ends on April 30. ACM submitted the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice for the fiscal year ending April 30,
1994 to a same day courier service on June 30, 1994, the last day of the two month filing deadline. Because ACM had net
sales during the fiscal year, the notice was accompanied by $25,031.59, the fee payable to register the shares sold
by ACM in excess of redemptions. The filing arrived at the SEC's filing desk after 5:30 p.m. on June 30, 1994, and was
then made on July 1, 1994, but was rejected as having been filed too late to be eligible for a registration fee based on
net sales. Thus, absent relief, applicant owes registration fees based on gross sales. For the fiscal year ending
April 30, 1994, this would amount to an additional $573,733.41.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and
to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In addition, the SEC must find
that an investment company was not at fault to grant an exemption from the two month filing deadline of rule 24f&hyph;2.

2. ACM believes that it made a good faith effort to file the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice on a timely basis by same-day courier.
ACM states that the delay in receipt of its filing was caused by an extraordinary series of delays precipitated by the
same-day courier service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. ACM believes that the requested relief meets the section 6(c) standards. Thus, ACM requests an exemption under
section 6(c) from rule 24f&hyph;2 to permit them to pay registration fees based on net sales.

Applicants' Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each existing Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and advised by the Adviser. The Open-End Trusts
are registered open-end management investment companies, and the Closed-End Trusts are registered closed-end
management investment companies. The Colonial Investment Services division (the ``Distributor'') of the Adviser
serves as the principal underwriter of the Open-End Trusts. Certain of the existing Trusts offer multiple series
of shares. The term ``Fund'' refers to any series of a Trust, if the Trust offers shares in multiple series, or to a Trust
that offers shares only in one series. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The board of trustees
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of each Fund currently consists of nine persons, eight of whom are not ``affiliated persons'' of the Adviser or the
Distributor within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Only the trustees who are not affiliated persons of the
Adviser or the Distributor (the ``Eligible Trustees'') are entitled to receive annual fees for their services. The
aggregate annual fees are, and are expected to remain, insignificant in comparison to applicants' total net assets.

It is expected that the aggregate amount payable to all trustees of the Trusts who receive remuneration from the Trusts
for their services in 1994 will be $791,000, which would represent .0053% of the Trusts' aggregate net assets as of
December 31, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Applicants request relief to permit the Eligible Trustees to elect to defer receipt of all or part of their trustees'
fees pursuant to a deferred fee agreement (the ``Agreement'') entered into between each Eligible Trustee and appropriate
Fund. Under the Agreement, the Eligible Trustees could defer payment of trustees' fees to defer payment of income
taxes or for other reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Under the Agreement, the deferred fees payable by a Fund to a particular Eligible Trustee will be credited to a book
reserve account established by the Fund (the ``Deferred Fee Account''), as of the date such fees would have been paid
to the Eligible Trustee. Trustees' fees payable for attending board meetings or board committee meetings will be
credited to the Deferred Fee Account on the following business day. The value of a Deferred Fee Account shall equal
the value such account would have had if the amounts credited to such account had been invested and reinvested in certain
designated securities (``Underlying Securities'') as of the date credited. Each Deferred Fee Account shall be credited
or charged with book adjustments reflecting all dividends, including interest income and capital gains, and all
unrealized gains and losses that would have been earned had the account been investing in such Underlying Securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Underlying Securities will be shares of Funds as agreed to between the applicable board of trustees and the participating
trustee. Although a Fund's own shares may serve as an Underlying Security, applicants do not anticipate that a Fund
will purchase its own shares. Rather, monies equal to the amount credited to the Deferred Fee Account will be invested
along with and in the same securities and proportions as the rest of the Fund's assets. Under existing deferral agreements,
certain trustees have deferred receipt of their compensation under an arrangement where the trustee is entitled
to receive an amount equal to the value such deferred compensation would have had if it had been invested in U.S. Treasury
Bills on the date upon which such compensation otherwise would have been paid to such trustee.

The staff of the Division of Investment Management has stated that it would not recommend that the Commission take
any enforcement action under the Act if registered investment companies establish deferred compensation plans
where the rate of return on the deferred compensation is based on the return on U.S. Treasury Bills. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The obligations of a Fund to make payments to the Deferred Fee Accounts will be general unsecured obligations of
the Fund, and payments made pursuant to the Agreement will be made from the Fund's general assets and property. As a
matter of risk management, each Fund intends and, with respect to any money market Fund that values its assets by the
amortized cost method, undertakes, to purchase and maintain the Underlying Securities in amounts equal to the deemed
investment of the Deferred Fee Accounts of its trustees. If a Fund chooses to purchase Underlying Securities to cover
its obligations under the Agreement, any and all such Underlying Securities will continue to be a part of the general
assets and property of the Fund. Any purchase of Underlying Securities will be made for the benefit of shareholders
generally and not for the Eligible Trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Under the Agreement, an Eligible Trustee may elect to defer payment of all or part of his or her trustee's fees until
(a) The trustee ceases to be a trustee of the Fund, (b) the trustee dies, (c) the dissolution, liquidation, or winding
up of the Fund, or the disposition of all of or substantially all of the Fund's assets (unless the Fund's obligations
under the Agreement have been assumed by a financially responsible party purchasing such assets), or (d) the merger
or consolidation of the Fund (unless, prior to such merger or consolidation, the board of trustees determines that
the Agreement shall survive the merger or consolidation).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Payments shall be made in a lump sum or in a number of annual installments, not to exceed ten, elected by the trustee at
the time of entering into the Agreement. Each annual payment will be made as of January 31. The trustee's right to receive
payments will be nontransferable, except that, in the event of a trustee's death, amounts payable to him or her thereafter
will be payable to his or her designated beneficiary.

Applicants acknowledge that the requested order would not permit a party acquiring a Fund's assets to assume a Fund's
obligations under the Agreement if such assumption of obligations would violate the Act. Accordingly, such assumption
would be permitted only if the assuming party is (1) Another Fund, (2) another registered investment company that
has received exemptive relief similar to that sought by the application, or (3) not a registered investment company.

8. The Agreement will not obligate a Fund to retain the services of a trustee, nor will it obligate a Fund to pay any particular
level of fees to any trustee. The proposed arrangements will not affect the voting rights of any of the Funds' shareholders.
If a Fund purchases Underlying Securities issued by another Fund, the purchasing Fund will vote such shares in proportion
to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants believe that the deferred fee arrangements are in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders,
and that the arrangements will enhance the ability of the Funds to attract and retain high caliber trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sections 18(a) and 18(c) restrict the ability of a registered closed-end investment company to issue senior securities.
Similarly, section 18(f)(1) generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing senior
securities. Section 13(a)(2) requires that any registered investment company obtain shareholder authorization
before issuing any senior securities not contemplated by the recitals of policy in its registration statement. Applicants
contend that the Agreement possesses none of the characteristics of senior securities that led Congress to enact
these sections. The Agreement would not: (a) Induce speculative investments or provide opportunities for manipulative
allocation of the expenses and profits of a Fund; (b) affect control of a Fund; (c) confuse investors or convey a false
impression of safety; or (d) be inconsistent with the theory of mutuality of risk. All liabilities for deferred fees
are expected to be offset by essentially equal amounts of assets that would not otherwise exist if the fees were paid
on a current basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 22(f) prohibits undisclosed restrictions on transferability or negotiability of redeemable securities
issued by open-end investment companies. Applicants contend that any restrictions created under the Agreement
clearly would be set forth in the Agreement, are included primarily to benefit the Eligible Trustees, and would not
adversely affect the interests of any shareholder of any Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Sections 22(g) and 23(a) generally prohibit a registered open-end and closed-end investment company, respectively,
from issuing any of their securities for services or for property other than cash or securities. Applicants assert
that, while a trustee would receive fees for services, such fees would be payable independent of the Agreement. The
Agreement would merely provide for deferral of payment of such fees and thus should be viewed as being issued not in
return for services but in return for a Trust not being required to pay such fees on a current basis. Applicant further
assert that these sections primarily are concerned with the dilutive effect on the equity and voting power than can
result when securities are issued for consideration that is not readily valued. Applicants submit that the Agreement
would not have such effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Rule 2a&hyph;7 imposes certain restrictions on the investments of ``money market funds,'' as defined under the
rule, that would prohibit a Fund that is a money market fund from investing in the shares of any other Fund. Applicants
submit that the requested exemption would permit the Funds in question to achieve an exact matching of Underlying
Securities with the deemed investments of the Deferred Fee Accounts, thereby ensuring that the deferred fees would
not affect net asset value. Applicants further assert that the amounts involved in all cases would be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in relation to the total net assets of each Fund, and would have no effect on the per share net asset value of the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act,
if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe
that the proposed arrangements satisfy the standards for an exemption from the provisions discussed above.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Section 17(a)(1) generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from selling any
security to such registered investment company. Each Fund may be an affiliated person of each other Fund under section
2(a)(3) of the Act. Applicants assert that section 17(a)(1) was designed to prevent sponsors of investment companies
from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises with which they were associated or to acquire controlling
interests in such enterprises. Applicants submit that the sale of securities issued by the Funds pursuant to the Agreement
does not implicate the concerns of Congress in enacting this section, but merely would facilitate the matching of
each Fund's liability for deferred fees with the Underlying Securities that would determine the amount of such liability.
Section 17(b) authorizes the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that
the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not
involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered
investment company, and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants assert that
the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 17(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 generally prevent a registered investment company's joint or joint and several
participation with an affiliated person in a transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement
or profit-sharing plan on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the affiliated person. Applicants
assert that any adjustments made to the Deferred Fee Accounts to reflect the income, gain, or loss on investments of
the assets of a Fund would be identical in amount to income, gain, and loss by other shareholders in the Fund. An Eligible
Trustee would neither directly or indirectly receive a benefit that otherwise would inure to the Funds or their shareholders.
Deferral of an Eligible Trustee's fees in accordance with the Agreement essentially would maintain the parties,
viewed both separately and in their relationship to one another, in the same position as if the fees were paid on a current
basis. When all payments have been made to an Eligible Trustee, such Eligible Trustee will be, relative to the Funds,
no better off than if such Eligible Trustee had received deferred fees on a current basis and invested them in shares
of the Underlying Securities.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. With respect to the requested relief from rule 2a&hyph;7, any money market Fund that values its assets by the amortized
cost method or penny-rounding method will buy and hold Underlying Securities that determine the performance of Deferred
Fee Accounts to achieve an exact match between such Fund's liability to pay deferred fees and the assets that offset
that liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If a Fund purchases Underlying Securities issued by an affiliated Fund, the purchasing Fund will vote such shares
in proportion to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Applicant (formerly, the GNMA Trust) is a Massachusetts business trust and an open-end, diversified investment
management company registered under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On December 17, 1985, Applicant filed a notification of registration under Section 8(a) of the 1940 Act and a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act registering an unlimited number of shares
of beneficial interest. The registration statement became effective on July 22, 1986, and the initial public offering
commenced July 25, 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On August 13, 1993, Applicant's board of trustees unanimously approved the terms of an agreement and plan of reorganization
(``Plan''). The Plan was approved by Applicant's shareholders on December 10, 1993. Applicant relied upon Rule 17a&hyph;8
under the 1940 Act in determining to merge its assets into an existing series of a registered investment management
company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On December 16, 1993, Applicant made a final distribution of dividend income to its security holders in the amount
of $0.1825 per share, for a total distribution of $342,672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. On December 17, 1993, pursuant to the Plan, Applicant transferred all of its assets to Colonial U.S. Fund for Growth
(``Colonial Growth'') in a non-taxable transaction. Colonial Growth is a series of Colonial Trust VI, a registered
management investment company. In exchange for the transfer of assets, Colonial Growth assumed Applicant's liabilities
and issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to Applicant's shareholders 3,552,164 of Colonial Growth Class A shares at a rate of 1.88 shares for each former share
of the Applicant. The exchange resulted in the complete liquidation, distribution and cancellation of 1,885,910.722
shares of Applicant then outstanding, valued at $42,692,625.55 based on the closing net asset value for Applicant
and the Colonial Growth as of December 17, 1993 of $22.64 and $12.02, respectively. The aggregate net assets of Colonial
Growth immediately after the exchange were $227,715,458. The Plan did not affect the net asset value of the shares
held by Applicant's shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicant's investment adviser paid all expenses incurred in connection with the Plan. These expenses totaled
approximately $79,063, and consisted of legal, auditing, printing, mailing and proxy solicitation expenses. No
brokerage commissions were paid with respect to the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicant has retained no assets and has no security holders. Applicant does not have any debts or other liabilities
which remain outstanding and is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries
of which were or are security holders of Applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs. Applicant will, after receipt of the relief requested, file certificates of dissolution
or similar documents in accordance with state law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicant states that it is current with all of its filings under the 1940 Act, including all Form N&hyph;SAR filings
for each semi-annual period for which such filing was or is required.

Applicants' Representatives;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Great-West Life is a stock file insurance company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great-West Assurance. Great-West
Assurance is a subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco, Inc. (``Great-West Lifeco''), an insurance holding company and
a subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation of Canada, a financial services company. Great-West Life is principally
engaged in offering insurance and annuity contracts, and is admitted to do business in the District of Columbia and
in all states, except New York.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Separate Account is a separate investment account established by Great-West Life for the purpose of investing
purchase payments received under the Contracts. The Separate Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment
trust and the Contracts are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Separate Account currently has nine investment divisions (``Divisions''). Seven Divisions invest solely in
corresponding portfolios of the Maxim Series Fund Inc. (``Maxim Fund''), and two Divisions invest solely in corresponding
Portfolios of TCI Portfolios Inc. (``TCI Fund'') (collective, ``Funds''). Each Division is subdivided into six
subaccounts (``Subaccounts''), two of which are used for allocations under the Contracts. The remaining four Subaccounts
are used for allocations under other variable annuity contracts previously offer by Great-West life. Additional
Divisions may be established in the future to invest in other portfolios of Maxim Fund or TCI Fund, or in other investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great-West Life may, in the future, issue through the Separate Account, and through other separate accounts that
it may establish in the future, other variable annuity contracts that are substantially similar in all material respects
to the Contracts (collectively, ``Future Contracts'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Maxim Fund and TCI Fund are registered open-end, diversified investment companies under the 1940 Act, each consisting
of one or more investment series or portfolios (collectively, ``Portfolios'') with different investment objectives
and policies. Great-West Life purchases and redeems Portfolio shares for the corresponding Divisions at net asset
value. Shares of the Funds also are offered to other affiliated or unaffiliated separate accounts of insurance companies
offering variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Great-West Assurance will serve as the principal underwriter of the Contracts. Great-West Assurance is a subsidiary
of Great-West Lifeco and is an affiliate of Great-West Life. Great-West Assurance is registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Contracts are to be used in connection with retirement plans that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment
under Section 401 or Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code as an individual retirement plan (``Qualified Plan'')
or with plans purchased on a non-tax qualified basis (``Non-Qualified Plan''). The Contracts may be used for other
purposes in the future, or offered only in connection with Qualified or Non-Qualified Plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Contracts provide for minimum initial purchase payments and permit additional minimum purchase payments
and periodic payments, subject to certain limitations. The Contracts provide for the accumulation of values on a
variable basis determined by the investment experience of the Divisions to which the Contract owner allocates Purchase
Payments. The Contracts also provide four Annuity Options for the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed and/or variable
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Contracts also provide for the payment of a death benefit. If the Annuitant dies prior to the date on which annuity
payments are to begin (``Retirement Date'') and before age 75, the death benefit will be equal to the greater of either;
(a) Contract Value less premium taxes, if any; or (b) total purchase payments made, less any partial surrenders of
Contract Value, surrender charges, periodic payments, and premium taxes, if any. If the Annuitant dies prior to Retirement
Date and after age 75, the Contract Value, less premium taxes, if any, will be paid to the beneficiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Various fees and expenses are deducted under the Contracts. An annual maintenance charge of $27 will be deducted
from the Contract Value prior to the Retirement Date to compensate Great-West Life for administrative services.
This charge is guaranteed not to exceed the cost of services to be provided over the life of the Contract, in accordance
with the provisions of Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. Great-West Life does not anticipate any profit from this
charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Any premium or other taxes assessed by any governmental entity will be paid by Great-West Life. If the Contract Value
is used to purchase an annuity under the Annuity Options, the dollar amount of any premium tax previously paid or payable
upon annuitization by Great-West Life will be charged against Contract Value. The applicable premium tax rates currently
range from 0% to 2.50%. The Separate Account and the Divisions will bear their own operating expenses and charges for
federal income taxes, should such taxes be incurred by Great-West Life in connection with the operation of the Separate
Account. No charge is made by Great-West Life for transfers of Contract Value among the Divisions. The Contracts also
are not subject to any Contract policy fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'')
is deducted on any total or partial surrender of Contract Value prior to the Retirement Date that are attributable
to Purchase Payments which have been credited to a Contract for less than seven years. Up to 10% of Contract Value as
of December 31 of a calendar year prior to the year in which the amount is being surrendered can be withdrawn once per
year without incurring the CDSC. Additional withdrawals are subject to a surrender charge equal to a percentage of
the amount distributed according to the following schedule:

Total surrender charges will not exceed 7% of Purchase Payments under the Contracts. No CDSC is assessed on or after
the seventh year of the Contracts. Applicants are relying on Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the 1940 Act to deduct the CDSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great-West Life does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing
the Contracts. If this charge is insufficient to cover the expenses, the deficiency will be met from Great-West Life's
general account assets, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expenses risks, discussed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the net asset value of the Separate Account will be imposed
to compensate Great-West Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts and
in connection with Future Contracts. Of this amount, 0.85% is allocable to mortality risks and 0.40% is allocable
to expense risks. No deduction will be made for mortality and expense risks after the Retirement Date under Contracts
electing certain Annuity Options that do not vary with the investment performance of the Divisions. The mortality
and expense risk charge is guaranteed never to exceed 1.25%. This charge may be a source of profit for Great-West Life
which will be added to its surplus and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The mortality risk arises from Great-West Life's contractual obligations to make Annuity Payments where one
of the Life Annuity Options is selected (determined in accordance with the Annuity Tables and other provisions contained
in the Contracts) regardless of how long an Annuitant may live. The mortality risk under the Contracts is the risk that,
upon selection of an Annuity Option with a life contingency, Annuitants will live longer than Great-West Life's actuarial
projections indicate, thereby resulting in higher than expected Annuity Payments. Great-West Life also assumes
a mortality risk if the Annuitant should die prior to the Contract anniversary nearest the 75th birthday. In that event,
Great-West Life is at risk to the extent that the amount of the Purchase Payments made exceed the Contract Value, less
partial surrenders and surrender charges as of the date notice of death is received.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. The expense risk borne by Great-West Life is the risk that the charges for administrative expenses, which are guaranteed
not to increase for the life of the Contracts, may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of issuing and administering
the Contracts in excess of the Contract Maintenance Charge.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicants request an order of the Commission under Section 6(c) for exemptions from Section 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the dedication of a maximum charge of 1.25% for the assumption of mortality
and expense risks from the assets of: (a) The Separate Account in connection with the issuance of the Contracts; (b)
the Separate Account in connection with the issuance of any Future Contracts; and (c) any other separate account established
in the future by Great-West Life in connection with the issuance of Future Contracts. Applicants believe that the
requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants submit that their request for exemptive relief for deduction of the 1.25% mortality and expense risk
charge from the assets of the Separate Account, or any other separate account established by Great-West Life in the
future, in connection with the issuance of Future Contracts, would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity
contract market by eliminating the need for Great-West Life the file redundant exemptive applications, thereby
reducing Great-West Life's administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. Applicants
further submit that the delay and expense involved in having repeatedly to seek exemptive relief would impair Great-West
Life's ability effectively to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Further, if Great-West Life
were required repeatedly to seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this Application,
investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested
exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally
grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust,
its depositor or principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments, other than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit
any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for
performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is within the range of
industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. This representation is based on Applicants' analysis of publicly
available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge
levels, the manner in which charges are imposed, the existence of charge level or annuity-rate guarantees, and the
markets in which the Contracts are offered. Applicants represent that Great-West Life will maintain at its administrative
offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of,
and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, prior to making available any Future Contracts through the Separate Account, or through other separate
accounts established in the future by Great-West Life, Applicants will represent that the mortality and expense
risk charge under any such Future Contracts will be within the range of industry practice for comparable contracts.
Applicants represent that Great-West Life will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology, and results of, its
comparative survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts,
all or a portion of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. Great-West
Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract owners. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by Great-West Life at its administrative offices and will be made available to the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge under
Future Contracts, all or a portion of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the
CDSC. Great-West Life also will maintain and make available to the Commission a memorandum setting forth the basis
for the same representation with respect to Future Contracts offered by the Separate Account and by any other separate
account established in the future by Great-West Life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants also represents that the Separate Account, and separate accounts established by Great-West Life in
the future, will invest only in underlying funds which undertake, in the event they should adopt a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1
to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors or trustees, majority of whom are not ``interested
persons'' of the company, formulate and approve any such plan.

3. GISC provided the initial capital for the Trust in 1989. As of June 30, 1994, GISC owned 13.55% of the Government Fund
and may be considered to control the Fund. In January 1993, Guardian Life provided the initial capital for the Bond
Fund. As of June 30, 1994, Guardian Life owned 50.24% of the Bond Fund and may be considered to control the Fund. The investment
objective of the Government Fund is to achieve a high level of current return through a combination of interest income
and net capital gains consistent with prudent investment risk and security of principal. The investment objective
of the Bond Fund is to secure a high level of current income and capital appreciation without undue risk to principal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. At a meeting held on June 23, 1994, the board of trustees of the Portfolio, including a majority of those trustees
who are not ``interested persons'' as defined in the Act, approved an agreement and plan of reorganization the ``Plan'').
Pursuant to the Plan, on the effective date of the transaction (the ``Closing Date''), the Government Fund will transfer
all of its assets and liabilities to the Bond Fund in exchange for a number of shares of the Bond Fund having an aggregate
net asset value equal to the aggregate net assets of the Government Fund exchanged. The Government Fund then will distribute
such Bond Fund shares to its shareholders on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis. Each Government Fund shareholder will have his or her Government Fund shares exchanged for the number of full
and fractional shares of the Bond Fund which, when multiplied by the net asset value per share of Bond Fund, will have
an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of that holder's shares in the Government Fund on
the Closing Date. On July 29, 1994, the Portfolio registered the shares of the Bond Fund to be issued pursuant to the
Plan with the SEC on Form N&hyph;14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. While the Bond Fund ordinarily imposes in initial sales charge in connection with the purchase of shares, the sales
charge will not apply to shares of the Bond Fund acquired pursuant to the proposed reorganization. Neither Fund imposes
a contingent deferred sales charge or other fee in connection with the redemption of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In evaluating whether to adopt the Plan and recommend its approval by shareholders of the Government Fund, the board
of trustees has considered the following factors, among others: (a) The potential benefits of the reorganization
to shareholders; (b) the compatibility of investment objectives, policies, restrictions and investment holdings
of the Government Fund and the Bond Fund; (c) the current total net assets of the two Funds and the current and historical
expenses and performance of each Portfolio; (d) the terms and conditions of the proposed reorganization and whether
it would result in dilution of any shareholder's interest; (e) the absence of any direct or indirect costs to be incurred
by either Fund or the Portfolio; and (f) the tax-free nature of the reorganization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Portfolio will submit the proposed Plan to the shareholders of the Government Fund for their approval at a meeting
called for that purpose on October 19, 1994. Shareholders of the Government Fund will receive a notice of the special
meeting of shareholders and a proxy statement and prospectus containing all material disclosures, including a description
of all material aspects of the proposed reorganization and a copy of the Plan. Consistent with the declaration of trust,
a majority of the outstanding shares of the Government Fund must approve the reorganization. GISC will vote the shares
it owns in the Government Fund in favor of the Plan and will pay all the costs of the reorganization. In addition to shareholders
approval, the consummation of the reorganization is conditioned upon receipt from the SEC of the order requested
herein.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from selling to or purchasing from such registered
company, any security or other property. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any person directly
or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
any other person is an affiliated person of that person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(b) provides that the SEC may exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the
terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy
of the registered investment company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act exempts from the prohibitions of section 17(a) mergers, consolidations, or purchases
or sales of substantially all the assets involving registered investment companies that may be affiliated persons,
or affiliated persons of an affiliated person, solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors
and/or common officers. The exemption provided by the rule is conditioned upon a determination by a majority of the
directors of each such investment company (including a majority of the directors of each company who are not interested
persons of the participating registered investment companies) that (a) participation in the transaction is in the
best interests of that registered investment company, and (b) the interests of existing shareholders of that registered
investment company will not be diluted as a result of the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed reorganization could rely on rule 17a&hyph;8, except for the fact that the Government Fund and the
Bond Fund may be affiliated persons for reasons other than those set forth in the rule. Because GISC, an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Guardian Life, directly owns more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of the Government Fund,
and Guardian Life directly owns more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of the Bond Fund, if the series funds
are treated as separate entities, the Portfolio may not rely upon rule 17a&hyph;8 because the Bond Fund and the Government
Fund may be affiliated persons because of the ultimate ownership by a single shareholder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Portfolio believes that the terms of the proposed reorganization meet the standards of section 17(b). The board
of trustees of the Portfolio, including a majority of the trustees who are not ``interested persons,'' has reviewed
and approved the terms of the proposed reorganization as set forth in the Plan, including the consideration to be paid
or received by all parties. They have independently determined for each of the Government Fund and the Bond Fund, that
the proposed reorganization will be in the best interests of the shareholders of each Fund and that the consummation
of the proposed reorganization will not result in the dilution of the current interests of the shareholders of the
Funds. If effectuated according to the Plan, the proposed reorganization will result in the Government Fund's assets
being managed together with the Bond Fund's assets in a combined portfolio of substantially greater size. The investment
objectives of the Government Fund and the Bond Fund are substantially similar, to provide positive total returns
without undue risks. The proposed transaction will comply with all the conditions that rule 17a&hyph;8 requires
for the protection of investment companies and their shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 17(d) prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, acting as principal, from effecting
any transaction in which such registered investment company is a joint participant with such person in contravention
of SEC rules and regulations. Rule 17d&hyph;1 provides that no joint enterprise or arrangement may be consummated
unless the SEC first approves the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Funds may be affiliated persons of each other, and the proposed transaction might be deemed to be a joint enterprise
or other joint arrangement. The Portfolio believes that the terms of the proposed Plan meet the standards for relief
under rule 17d&hyph;1, in that the terms of the Plan are reasonable and fair to all parties, do not involve overreaching
and are consistent with the investment policies of the Funds. The participation in the Plan by each Fund is also not
on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each of the Investment Companies is an open-end management investment company organized under the laws of the State
of Maryland. The Manager serves as the investment adviser for the Investment Companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Board of Directors of each Investment Company currently consists of seven persons, five of whom are not ``interested
persons'' of that Investment Company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. Each director is entitled
to receive an annual fee plus meeting attendance fees from each Investment Company, except that directors who are
interested persons of the Manager receive no remuneration from the Investment Companies. Non-interested directors
who serve on certain committees of the directors are entitled to additional fees for such service. The aggregate amount
payable to the non-interested directors will be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in comparison to the aggregate net assets of the existing Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants propose to implement a Deferred Compensation Plan for non-interested directors (the ``Plan''). The
purpose of the Plan is to permit individual directors to elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of the fees (the ``Deferred
Fees'') to enable them to defer payment of income taxes on such fees or for other financial goals. Applicants believe
that the availability of deferred fee arrangements will enhance the ability of the Funds to attract and retain qualified
directors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Under the Plan, a director's Deferred Fees are credited as of the date such fees would have been paid to a separate
book reserve account established with respect to each series of each participating Fund (each a ``Deferred Fee Account'').
The value of the Deferred Fee Account as of any date will be equal to the value each account would have had of such date
if the amounts credited to such account had been invested and reinvested as of the date credited in shares of certain
designated series of the Funds. Shares of any series of any Fund, other than TCI or Premium Reserves,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 as the Plan Committee and the participating director shall have agreed upon in writing from time to time, may be selected
(the ``Designated Shares''). Each Deferred Fee Account shall be credited or charged with book adjustments representing
all interest, dividends, and other earnings, and all gains and losses that would have been realized had such account
been invested in the Designated Shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
TCI and Premium Reserves are excluded from those Funds the shares of which are eligible for selection because neither
generally would be available to participating directors in their individual capacities. TCI is sold to insurance
companies and Premium Reserves has a minimum investment requirement of $100,000 (an amount in excess of amounts anticipated
to be deferred by any director). Because the directors believe it inappropriate to be able to invest in Funds they would
not otherwise be able to invest in individually, it is anticipated that future Funds with restrictive provisions
also will be excluded similarly from those eligible for selection under the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. With respect to the obligations created under the Plan, each director will remain a general unsecured creditor.
The Plan does not create an obligation of any Fund to any director to purchase, hold, or dispose of any investments,
and if a Fund or series thereof should choose to purchase investments, including Designated Shares, all such investments
will continue to be part of the general assets and property of such Fund or series.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As a matter of prudent risk management, each Fund intends, where it determines appropriate, and with respect to
money management series that employ the amortized cost method of valuation, will undertake, to purchase and maintain
Designated Shares in amounts equal to the amount of Deferred Fees so credited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Plan will allow a director to elect to defer payment of fees payable to him by a Fund with respect to any year (including
all adjustments representing interest, dividends and other earnings, and all gains and losses, credited or charged
with respect thereof) until (a) the director ceases to be a director of the Fund or (b) the Plan is terminated. Payments
to directors may be made in a lump sum or in such number of annual installments (not to exceed 10) as shall be elected by
the director. In the event of death, amounts payable to the director under the Plan will become payable to his designated
beneficiary; in all other events, the director's right to receive payments will be non-transferable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Plan will not obligate any Fund to retain the services of a director, nor will it obligate any Fund or series to
pay any (or any particular level of) fees to any director. Rather, it will merely permit a director to defer receipt
of those fees that would otherwise be payable from each Fund.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. No Fund will purchase any Designated Shares, nor will it credit the Deferred Fee Accounts as though it had purchased
any Designated Shares, before the requested exemptive order is issued.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sections 13(a)(2), 13(a)(3), 18(f)(1), 22(f), 22(g), 17(a)(1), and 17(d) of the Act and rules 2a&hyph;1 and 17d&hyph;1
thereunder, taken together, might be deemed to preclude the Funds and their directors from implementing the Plan
absent an exemptive order form the Commission. Each Investment Company and the Manager believes, however, that the
Plan is and will be in the best interests of each Fund adopting the Plan and its shareholders and is and will be consistent
with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In addition, applicants believe that exemption
of the deferred fee arrangement and transactions related thereto from certain provisions of the Act is necessary
and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants submit that the ability of the Funds to recruit and retain highly qualified directors will be enhanced
if they are able to offer their directors the option of deferred payment of fees. Moreover, on a comparative basis,
deferral would have a negligible effect on each Fund's total assets and liabilities because the total fees paid to
each director will be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in relation to the size of each Fund, and will have no effect on net assets and net income per share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any class
of senior security or selling any senior security of which it is the issuer. In addition, section 13(a)(2) of the Act
requires that a registered investment company obtain authorization by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting
securities before issuing any senior securities not contemplated by the recitals of policy contained in its registration
statement. The Plan does not and would not give rise to any of the ``evils'' that led to Congress' concerns in enacting
these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. Section 13(a)(3) of the Act prohibits registered investment companies from, absent shareholder approval, deviating
from any ``fundamental'' investment policy that is changeable only upon shareholder approval. The fundamental
investment policies of certain series of the Funds
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 would prohibit investment in Designated Shares of other series offered by the Funds. Any series of the Funds with these
types of policies would be prevented, without shareholder approval, from purchasing shares of other series of the
Funds. If any such series of Funds are prevented from so investing, they will not be able to effect the matching of Designated
Shares with the liabilities credited to the Deferred Fee Accounts. This matching is desirable because it will help
ensure that the deferred fee arrangements will not affect the net asset value of any series' shares. Applicants believe
that it is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act to exempt the Funds from the provisions of section 13(a)(3). The relief
requested from section 13(a)(3) would extend only to the specifically named applicants and not to future investment
companies or series because future open-end management investment companies or future series of currently effective
open-end management companies will be able to establish fundamental policies with the necessary exceptions to accommodate
purchases of Fund shares in connection with the Plan.

The specific Funds seeking relief from the provisions of section 13(a)(3) are: Twentieth Century's Cash Reserve,
U.S. Governments Short-Term, U.S. Governments Intermediate-Term, Limited-Term Bond, Intermediate-Term Bond,
Long-Term Bond, Tax-Exempt Short-Term Bond, Tax-Exempt Intermediate-Term Bond, and Tax-Exempt long-Term Bond,
all of which are limited to the purchase of bonds and other fixed income securities; Twentieth Century's Balanced
Investors, which is limited to ``common stocks *&blank;*&blank;* bonds and other fixed income securities''; Capital's
Value which is restricted to ``securities that management believes to be undervalued at the time of purchase''; and
Premium Reserves' Government Reserve, Capital Reserve, and Management Bond, which are limited to the purchase of
bonds and other fixed income securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Section 22(f) of the Act prohibits a registered open-end investment company from restricting the transferability
or negotiability of any security of which it is the issuer unless the restriction is disclosed in its registration
statement and does not contravene rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission. Section 22(g) of the Act generally
prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services or for property
other than cash or securities.

6. Section 22(f) was designed to bar only those restrictions on transferability or negotiability not disclosed to
the holder of the subject security or expressly prohibited by Commission rule or regulations, neither of which circumstances
would apply to the restriction of transferability of a director's benefits under the Plan. Such restriction is clearly
set forth in the Plan, is included primarily to benefit the participating director, and does not adversely affect
the interests of the directors or of a shareholder of any Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. With respect to section 22(g), the legislative history of the Act suggests that Congress was concerned with the
dilutive effect on the equity and voting power of common stock of, or units of beneficial interest in, an open-end company
if the company's securities were issued for consideration not readily valued. Applicants assert that the Plan would
not have this effect. Also, a director's right to receive payments under the Plan are not granted in return for services
or property other than cash already owed to the director. Although any director's fees that may be payable to a director
would clearly be for services rendered, a Fund's obligation to pay such fees would exist whether or not the Plan was
in effect. The Plan would merely provide for deferral of the payment of such fees and thus any rights under the Plan should
be viewed as being ``issued'' not for services but for the Fund's not being required to pay such fees on a current basis.
Thus, the requested exemption of the proposed deferred fee arrangement and future transactions effected pursuant
to such arrangement from section 22(g) of the Act would not be inconsistent with the protection of investors and the
purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any
affiliated person of such person, from selling any security to such registered investment company. The section was
designed to prevent sponsors of investment companies from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises
with which they are associated or to acquire controlling interest in such enterprises. Applicants believe that the
sale of securities issued by the various series of the Funds pursuant to the Plan does not implicate Congress concerns
in enacting this section, but merely facilities the matching of the liabilities for Deferred Fees with Designated
Shares, the value of which determines the amount of such liabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Rule 2a&hyph;7 provides that the current price per share of any ``money market fund'' may be computed by use of the
amortized cost method or the penny-rounding method, provided that the money market funds meets certain conditions.
These conditions include, among others, (a) that the money market fund limit its investments to securities that have
a remaining maturity of 397 days or less and that meet certain quality standards and (b) that the money market fund will
not maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that exceeds 90 days. Applicants believe that an exemption
from rule 2a&hyph;7 for each money market fund to the limited extent required to permit them to invest in Designated
Shares (and to exclude Designated Shares from the calculation of such series' dollar-weighted average maturities)
is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act. Such an exemption would permit the series in question to achieve an exact matching
of Designated Shares with the deemed investments of the Deferred Fee Accounts, thereby ensuring that the deferred
fee arrangements will not affect net asset value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder are designed to limit or prevent a registered investment
company's joint or joint and several participation with an affiliated person in a transaction in connection with
any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan on a basis different or less advantageous
than that of the affiliated person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Under the Plan, each Fund will have discretion to set aside cash to fund the general obligations accruing thereunder,
and each Fund may invest cash in those shares of one or more series of Funds representing Designated Shares. Adjustments
are to be made to the Deferred Fee Accounts to reflect the income, gain or loss with respect to the Designated Shares.
The changes in value would be identical to the changes in share value experienced by any shareholder of the same series
during the same period, but whose shares were not held in a Deferred Fee Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an affiliated person, the participating director would neither directly nor indirectly receive a benefit that
would otherwise inure to the Funds or any of their shareholders and thus the Plan would not constitute a joint or joint
and several participation by any Fund with an affiliated person on a basis different from or less advantageous than
that of the affiliated person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following

1. With respect to the requested relief from rule 2a&hyph;7, any money market series of the Funds that values its assets
by the amortized cost method will buy and hold Designated Shares that determine the performance of Deferred Fee Accounts
to achieve an exact match between such series' liability to pay deferred fees and the assets that offset that liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If a Fund purchases Designated Shares issued by an affiliated Fund, the Fund will vote such shares in proportion
to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Sentry is a stock life insurance company that was organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin in 1958. SILIC
is a stock life insurance company that was originally organized in 1966 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
as Patriot General Life Insurance Company. SILIC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sentry. SESI is registered with
the SEC as a broker-dealer, is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and serves as the principal
underwriter for variable annuity contracts issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the Sentry Account and the SILIC Account (the ``Sentry Contracts'' and the ``SILIC Contracts,'' respectively,
and, together, the ``Contracts''). Sentry, SILIC , and SESI are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Sentry Insurance
a Mutual Company, a Wisconsin mutual insurer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sentry established the Sentry Account in 1983 pursuant to the laws of the State of Wisconsin. The Sentry Account
is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust, and the Sentry Contracts are registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 (``1993 Act''). SILIC established the SILIC Account in 1983 to the laws of the Commonwealth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Massachusetts. The SILIC Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, and the SILIC Contracts
are registered under the 1933 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Each Account consists of four subaccounts: a Liquid Asset Subaccount; a Growth Subaccount; a Limited Maturity
Bond Subaccount; and a Balanced Subaccount. Each of the subaccounts invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding
portfolio of the Neuberger &amp; Berman Advisers Management Trust (``Fund''). The Fund is registered under the 1940
Act as a diversified open-end management investment company, and the shares issued by the Fund are registered under
the 1933 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Sentry Contracts and the SILIC Contracts are identical in all material respects, except for the identity and
depositor of the separate account issuing the respective Contract. The Contracts provide for the accumulation of
contract values and payment of monthly annuity payments on a variable basis. The Contracts are designed for use by
individuals in retirement plans on a qualified or non-qualified basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Sentry has or will shortly enter into an agreement providing for the sale of all outstanding stock of SILIC to an unrelated
third party. One of the conditions of the sale will be that Sentry and SILIC enter into an assumption reinsurance arrangement
providing for the transfer to Sentry of all assets and liabilities of SILIC, other than the minimum amount of capital
necessary to support SILIC's licenses. Sentry will, pursuant to the assumption reinsurance agreement, assume legal
ownership of the SILIC Account assets and become responsible for satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations
arising under the SILIC Contracts and outstanding at the time of the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In order to avoid the administrative duplication that would result from maintaining two identical unit investment
trusts, Sentry has decided to effectively merge the Accounts by transferring the assets of the SILIC Account (consisting
of shares of the Fund) to the Sentry Account (the ``Proposed Transaction''). The Sentry Account will continue to exist,
and the SILIC Separate Account thereafter will be deregistered as an investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 company. The effect of the Proposed Transaction will be that, as of its effective date, the Sentry Account will support
the Sentry Contracts, the SILIC Contracts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 those originally issued by the SILIC Account), and any Contracts issued subsequent to the effective date of the Proposed
Transaction. The assets supporting the former SILIC Contracts will continue to be invested exclusively in shares
of the Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Proposed Transaction will be effected at the net asset values of the subaccounts involved, and no charges will
be imposed or other deductions made in connection therewith. The Proposed Transaction also will not affect the net
asset value of any subaccount: the net asset values for the four subaccounts of the Sentry Account in effect immediately
after the transaction will be identical to the net asset values for the subaccounts of the SILIC Account in effect immediately
prior to the transaction. All costs of the transaction will be borne by Sentry and not by Contractowners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The succession of Sentry to SILIC as the insurance company issuing the Contracts will not dilute or otherwise adversely
affect the economic interests of the Contractowners. The only change discernible to a Contractowner as a result of
the Proposed Transaction will be the identity and depositor of the separate account in which his or her cash value is
invested. The fees deducted from assets supporting the former SILIC Contracts after the Proposed Transaction will
not differ in amount or type from those currently being deducted from the Sentry Account. After the Proposed Transaction,
the guarantees that are not allocated to the Sentry Account (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum death benefit) will be backed by Sentry's pool of assets, which, based on financial information as of December
31, 1993, is more than sixty times larger than SILIC's. Moreover, as of the date hereof, Sentry is rated ``A+'' by A.M.
Best, while SILIC is rated ``NA4'' (rating procedure inapplicable). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Proposed Transaction and the other transactions related to the sale of SILIC will be approved in advance by the
respective Boards of Directors of Sentry and SILIC. Prior approval of the transaction will be obtained from the Massachusetts
Insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Department and any other applicable regulatory authority. To the extent notification to Contractowners is required
pursuant to generally applicable state insurance laws relating to assumption reinsurance, it will be provided.
Applicable state insurance law does not require that Contractowners vote on the transaction or be granted any ``opt-out''
rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In offer to reflect the transfer of assets supporting the SILIC Contracts to the Sentry Account, Sentry will file
a new 1933 Act registration statement for the Contracts and will amend the 1940 Act registration statement for the
Sentry Account. Once the new 1933 Act registration statement becomes effective, Sentry will distribute copies of
the prospectus contained therein to owners of outstanding Contracts. Once the Proposed Transaction is effected,
application will be made to the Commission pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act and Rule 8f&hyph;1 thereunder for an
order declaring that the SILIC Account has ceased to be an investment company.

11. Certain charges will be imposed under the SILIC Contracts proposed to be supported by the Sentry Account. Sentry
will deduct a mortality and expense risk charge equal on an annual basis to 1.20% of the average daily net asset value
of the Sentry Account. Of this charge, .80% will be for mortality risks and .40% will be for expense risks. This charge
compensates Sentry for providing a mortality guarantee, a death benefit, an expense guarantee, and the waiver of
the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, if any, upon the death of the annuitant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Sentry will deduct a contract maintenance charge of $30 per SILIC Contract from contract values on each contract
anniversary the SILIC Contract is in force, or when the value of the SILIC Contract is withdrawn in full prior to a contract
anniversary. Sentry guarantees that the amount of the contract maintenance charge will not be increased in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. No sales charge was imposed on the SILIC Contracts at the time of sale. A contingent deferred sales charge is imposed
on surrenders of purchase payments within six years after their being made. Thereafter, the charge is equal to zero.
The amount of the contingent deferred sales charge is calculated by allocating purchase payments to the amount surrendered,
multiplying each such allocated purchase payment by the appropriate percentage determined on the basis of the table
below, and adding the products of each such multiplication.

The contingent deferred sales charge is intended to provide reimbursement for sales-related expenses. To the extent
the charge is insufficient to cover all distribution costs, Sentry may use the mortality and expense risk charge to
make up any difference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Sentry will permit SILIC Contractowners to transfer all or part of the contract values between eligible mutual
fund(s) or portfolio(s) subject to certain conditions. Currently, Sentry does not impose any charge for effecting
transfers but it reserves the right to assess a transfer fee in the future subject to prior Commission approval or pursuant
to any applicable exemptive release issued by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Any premium taxes payable to any governmental entity as a result of the existence of the SILIC Contracts or the Sentry
Account will be charged against contract value. Premium taxes currently imposed range from 0% to 4.0%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Sentry deducts from the Sentry Account any income taxes resulting from the operation of the Sentry Account. Sentry
has not made a provision for taxes within the Sentry Account for the payment of any tax obligation because Sentry believes
that the operations of the Sentry Account and the underlying Trust will be conducted in such a manner as to not give rise
to such tax obligation. Sentry has reserved the right, however, to establish such a provision in the future if it determines

17. On July 17, 1984, the SEC issued an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act to SILIC, the SILIC Account, and
SESI, exempting them from Sections 26(a) and 27(c) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit certain deductions
and practices in connection with the SILIC Contracts. The SEC granted identical relief on the same day to Sentry, the
Sentry Account, and SESI in connection with the Sentry Contracts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated
person of such a person, from knowingly selling any securities or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2)
of the Act prohibits these persons from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment
company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an ``affiliated person'' of another person to include any person directly
or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such other person. The Sentry Account and
the SILIC Account may be deemed to be under the common control of Sentry, which is the depositor of the Sentry Account
and the parent of the depositor of the SILIC Account. While Applicants do not concede that Section 17(a) applies to
the Proposed Transaction, because the Sentry Account and the SILIC Account are affiliated persons, the transfer
of assets from the SILIC Account to the Sentry Account arguably involves these entities, acting as principals, in
buying and selling securities or other property from or to one another in contravention of Section 17(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that a person may apply for an order of exemption from the provisions of Section
17(a) in connection with a transaction prohibited by that section, and that the Commission shall grant such an application
if evidence establishes that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or
received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed
transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration
statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Although Rule 17a&hyph;8 is not available in this case, Applicants submit that the Commission can look to the rule
to determine whether the transaction is reasonable and fair. Applicants assert that the participating companies'
investment objectives, policies, restrictions, and portfolios are compatible. Both the Sentry Account and SILIC
Account invest exclusively in shares of the Fund, and, after the Proposed Transaction, the Sentry Account will continue
to invest in shares of the Fund and provide holders of SILIC Contracts with the same investment options as before the
Proposed Transaction. Accordingly, the Proposed Transaction will result in no change in the investment objectives,
policies, restrictions, or portfolios of the separate account funding the SILIC Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants also represent that the transfer of assets held by the SILIC Account to the Sentry Account will be made
at the relative net asset values of the subaccounts. No dilution of, or increase in, the SILIC Contractowners' contract
values will occur as a result of the Proposed Transaction. The transfer will not result in any change in charges, costs,
fees, or expenses borne by Contractowners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Finally, Applicants state that no direct or indirect costs will be incurred by the SILIC Account or the Sentry Account
as a result of the transaction. No charges, costs, fees, or other expenses would be incurred by holders of the Contracts
as a result of, or in connection with, the Proposed Transaction. Thus, the Proposed Transaction will not result in
dilution of the economic interests of the Contractowners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants represent that the Proposed Transaction does not involve overreaching on the part of any person involved.
The purpose of the transfer is to consolidate two identical separate accounts, both of which issue identical contracts,
have the same principal underwriter, and invest in the same underlying mutual fund, into a single separate account.
This aggregation will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings on Sentry's part because Sentry can
consolidate its separate account operations. It also will allow SILIC Contractowners to participate in a separate
account that is sizable in terms of its total net assets and can be expected to grow since sales of Sentry contracts will
continue after the Proposed Transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Section 17(b) also requires that the Proposed Transaction be consistent with the policy of each registered investment
company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Applicants represent
that because the assets underlying the SILIC Contracts and the Sentry Contracts will continue to be invested in shares
of one or more portfolios of the Fund in the same manner as before the Proposed Transaction, the assets underlying the
SILIC Contracts and the Sentry Contracts will continue to be invested according to the investment policies recited
in their respective registration statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Finally, Section 17(b) requires that the Proposed Transaction be consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
Applicants represent that the Proposed Transaction is consistent with the general policies and purposes of the Act.
The transfer does not present any of the issues or abuses that Section 17(a) in particular, and the 1940 Act in general,
were designed to prevent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In light of the foregoing, Applicants request an exemption from Section 17(a) of the Act, pursuant to Section 17(b)
thereof, to permit the proposed transfer. Applicants represent that the terms of the proposed transfer described
in this Application, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching; are consistent with the investment policies of each of the Accounts; and are consistent with the general
purposes of the Act.

10. Section 26(a)(2)(C) provides that no payment to the depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
unit investment trust shall be allowed the trustee or custodian as an expense except compensation, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties
normally performed by the trustee or custodian. Section 27(c)(2) prohibits a registered investment company or a
depositor or underwriter for such company for selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments on such certificates, other than sales loads, are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications
prescribed in Section 26(a)(1), and are held by such trustee or custodian under an agreement containing substantially
the provisions required by Sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Sentry, the Sentry Account, and SESI (``Section 6(c) Applicants'') request an order under Section 6(c) of the
1940 Act exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the
deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the Sentry Account as provided for by the SILIC Contracts previously
issued through the SILIC Account and proposed to be supported by the Sentry Account pursuant to the Proposed Transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Sentry represents that the charge of 1.20% for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks
undertaken by Sentry and within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This
representation is based upon Sentry's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products,
taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed
annuity rates. Sentry will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting
forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of its comparative survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Section 6(c) Applicants acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge,
all or a portion of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the sales charge.
Sentry has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Sentry Account and SILIC Contractowners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
maintained by the Sentry at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Sentry represents that the Sentry Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake,
in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, to
have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of Section
2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.

Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting the Proposed
Transaction from the provisions of Section 17(a), to the extent necessary to permit that transfer of assets underlying
the SILIC Contracts to the Sentry Account. In addition, the Section 6(c) Applicants request that the Commission issue
an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction by Sentry of mortality and
expense risk charges from Sentry Account as provided for by the SILIC Contracts previously supported by the Sentry
Account pursuant to the Proposed Transaction. Applicants and the Section 6(c) Applicants, as appropriate, submit
that, for all of the reasons stated above, granting the relief requested herein is appropriate in the public interest,
and consistent with the policy and purposes of the 1940 Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has decided to prepare a supplement to the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the effects of changes
in aircraft flight patterns over the State of New Jersey caused by implementation of the Expanded East Coast Plan (EECP).
As a result of the analysis phase of the comment period associated with the DEIS, new information was developed by the
FAA. Additionally, new information was received from the public during the comment period. Since this information
is pertinent to the decision process leading to issuance of a final EIS (FEIS), the public should have an opportunity
to examine the new material and comment on it prior to completion of the FEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The supplemental DEIS (SDEIS) was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Copies
have been mailed to individuals that participated in the EIS process as well as to libraries in select locations throughout
New Jersey.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of key portions of the SDEIS and major areas of concern identified by the public. It is not
intended to duplicate or cover every aspect of the SDEIS. Substantive comments submitted to the FAA should address
the SDEIS, not this summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Summary of Key Portions of the SDEIS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Alternatives and Mitigation Under Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following alternatives were evaluated and are being considered by the FAA:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Alternative A. Maintain the current (as defined in 1991) EECP structure. (Proposed action and no action)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Alternative B. Return to 1986 air traffic routes and procedures using 1991 traffic. (Rollback)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Alternative C2. Route Newark south flow departure traffic from over Raritan Bay to over the ocean (at night only)
via a specific path defined by the Solberg and Colts Neck navigational aids. (Nighttime only oceanic/military routing)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative D3. Spread aircraft departing Newark runways 22L and 22R to three different headings. (Spreading of
fanning)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These alternatives are described in detail in Chapter 3 of the SDEIS. Two mitigation measures were evaluated and are
also being considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Routing some westbound departures from Newark to a new departure gate in the vicinity of the Solberg navigational
aid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Moving LaGuardia arrival traffic further south from its current routing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These mitigation measures are described in detail in Chapter 6 of the SDEIS. These measures, if selected by the decision-maker
for implementation, would reduce noise by Day-Night Level (DNL) 5 dB or greater for approximately 18,500 residents
of the Scotch Plains and Fanwood areas of Union County, New Jersey. These were two of the areas that experienced some
of the greatest increases in noise as a result of implementation of the EECP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Environmental Consequences
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of the alternatives would cause significant noise, air quality or water quality impacts. (The one exception
identified in the area of noise results from the assumptions used in reconstructing and modeling the return to 1986
routes and procedures.) Noise analysis indicates that 1.45 million individuals would be impacted by noise increases
of DNL 5 dB or greater if the FAA returned to use of 1986 routes and procedures, while approximately 45,000 individuals
would experience noise benefits of DNL 5 dB or greater. Fanning and nighttime use of ocean routing would have marginal
noise benefits. In response to the volume of comments concerning noise impacts in particular communities, Appendix
F of the SDEIS provides the increases in noise level predicted for each census block in New Jersey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Public Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparing the SDEIS the FAA has carefully summarized and addressed the comments received on the DEIS and made revisions
to the text as appropriate. There have been extensive opportunities for public participation since the DEIS was made
available on November 12, 1992. In January, 1993, the FAA held public hearings in New Jersey to obtain comments on the
DEIS. In addition, two public meetings were held in Staten Island, New York to address the DEIS and the New York Metropolitan
Area Aircraft Noise Mitigation Review, a study mandated by Congress, which specifically addressed noise issues
in the New York metropolitan area, including parts of Connecticut and New Jersey, separate from the EIS action. The
comment period on the DEIS extended from November 12, 1992 to November 23, 1993. This 369 day comment period was well
in excess on NEPA requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Areas of Controversy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to noise, air, and water quality impacts, the major areas of controversy concerning this EIS were alternate
use of ocean routing, effects or aircraft noise on property values, and the scope of the EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Ocean Routing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters believed the alternative of using ocean routes 24 hours a day should be studied in detail as a reasonable
alternative. Several different proposals were considered in the DEIS, but eliminated due to concerns about operational
feasibility and potential environmental impacts. In June 1993, the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental Research
(NJCER), on behalf of the New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise, submitted a proposal to route all Newark Airport
departures south, down the Arthur Kill and over Raritan Bay to the ocean. This study was analyzed operationally and
modeled to determine its noise impacts within the scope of this EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operational examination indicates this proposal would cause about 5 points of conflicting traffic within New Jersey,
require tunneling of traffic from Newark under traffic from other airports, and cause substantial delays at Newark.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noise analysis indicates this proposal would have net benefits of DNL 5 dB or greater for approximately 228,000 New
Jersey residents (690,000 residents would benefit while 462,000 residents would experience increased noise of
DNL 5 dB or greater). In addition there appear to be potentially significant adverse noise impacts in areas south of
Newark that would be overflown by aircraft at altitudes below 3,000 above ground level (AGL) feet as well as in New York
and Connecticut. Additional environmental review would be required to examine these impacts, which are beyond the
scope of this EIS. This proposal is described in detail in Chapter 1 of the SDEIS.

B. Effect of Noise on Property Values
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another area of concern was the effect of noise increases on real property values. There is insufficient scientific
data to support a reasonable conclusion about whether the noise levels associated with implementation of the EECP
have, or its alternatives would have, depressed property values in New Jersey. The economic studies of the effects
of airport noise on house values to date, which have found a slight devaluation, have involved properties in or near
urban areas surrounding major airports at noise exposure levels exceeding those in this EIS. This is discussed in
detail in Section 5.2.1 of the SDEIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Scope of the EIS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another controversial issue was the scope of the EIS. The legal and policy reasons supporting the decision to limit
the scope of the EIS to New Jersey and to air traffic changes above 3,000 AGL feet are fully explained in Chapter 2 of the
SDEIS and Appendix A. Briefly, the FAA adhered strictly to the congressional mandate to study New Jersey because of
the complexity of an expanded study, the difficulty of identifying objective criteria for excluding portions of
the other 18 States and the District of Columbia that were also potentially affected by the EECP, and the time constraints
on the EIS process. The EIS examines changes above 3,000 AGL feet because that was the scope of the EECP. To assure compliance
with NEPA, no alternative will be selected for implementation until all applicable environmental review requirements
have been satisfied.

Ford Motor Company; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, Michigan has determined that some of its windows fail to comply with the labeling
requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and
has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford has also applied
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on
the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgement concerning the merits of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code
for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z&hyph;26.1&hyph;1977, January
26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that typical automotive tempered glass with
a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent shall be labeled ``AS3.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford manufactured approximately 1,820,000 quarter windows with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent
for use in 1986 through 1994 model year Ranger Supercab vehicles. These windows were labeled ``AS2'' instead of ``AS3.''
Approximately 7,900 were located and scrapped. The remaining windows have been used in vehicle production or provided
to aftermarket distributors for service replacement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For supports its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[Ford believes that t]he incorrect marking presents no risk of accident or injury. The windows can be installed only
as rear quarter windows in Ranger Supercab trucks; AS2 and S3 glazing are both appropriate for these applications
in accordance with Standard 205. In Ford's judgement, the mismarking is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. The stated purposes of FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure
a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility
of occupants being thrown through vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted the affected quarter windows
fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205. Because all performance requirements are met, the
incorrect marking of the quarter windows has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended
by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mismarking should not cause confusion in glass replacement in vehicles in service. Aftermarket distributors
do not use the marking to determine which glazing is used for replacement. Rather, replacement parts are determined
by service part numbers which are obtained from cataloged listings. Further, we are not aware of any confusion in aftermarket
servicing of vehicles as a result of this mismarking.

<DOCTITLE>General Motors Corporation; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General Motors Corporation (GM) of Warren, Michigan, has determined that some of its vehicles fail to comply with
49 CFR 571.209, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies,'' and has filed an
appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' GM has also applied to be exempted
from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that
the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgment concerning the merits of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph S4.6(b) of FMVSS No. 209 states that a seat belt assembly shall be labeled with the following statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This seat belt assembly is for use only in [insert specific seating position(s), e.g., `front right'] in [insert specific
vehicles make(s) and model(s)].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GM produced two different populations of vehicles which do not meet the labeling requirements stated in the standard.
The first population of vehicles, 68,405 1994 model year Chevrolet and GMC G-vans, were built with left-side seat
belt assemblies that were labeled as right-side assemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second population of vehicles, 31,978 1992&hyph;94 model year Chevrolet and GMC K20753 extended cap pickups,
were built with front outboard seat belt assemblies with the appropriate model designation omitted. The model designation
is K20753.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM supports its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For both these issues, the GM part numbers and manufacturer's model numbers correctly identify the affected seat
belt assemblies. In addition, the service parts manuals correctly specify the proper part numbers if replacement
parts were needed. In the case of the G-van seat belt assemblies, it is not possible to install the left front seat belt
assembly at the right front position. For the K 20753 model, the issue is the omission of an appropriate model. Usage
of the seat belt assembly in any of the models identified on the label is appropriate, as would be usage in the K 20753.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is GM's understanding that the purposed of the subject requirement was to provide the person 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
replacing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a seat belt assembly in a vehicle with appropriate seat position and vehicle model information. However, original
equipment seat belt assemblies have already been installed in the appropriate models and positions at the assembly
plant. The Agency stated in a recent rulemaking proposal (Docket 74&hyph;14; Notice 81, dated May 10, 1993), ``*&blank;*&blank;*
that seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment in new motor vehicles need not be required to be labeled
with position model information. This information is only useful if the assembly is removed with the intention of
using the assembly as a replacement in another vehicle. NHTSA does not believe this is a common practice.'' GM agrees
and believes that the removal of original equipment seat belt assemblies for the purpose of replacement installation
in another vehicle is rare. The Agency finalized that rulemaking action on April 15, 1994, eliminating the required
label verbiage on seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment by vehicle manufacturers.

This notice announces the decision by NHTSA that 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE passenger cars not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United
States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified
version of the 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE), and they are capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United States if its safety features comply with, or
are capable of being altered to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive
test data or such other evidence as NHTSA decides to be adequate.

Europa International, Inc. of Santa Fe, New Mexico (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;91&hyph;002) has petitioned
NHTSA to decide whether 1995 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs are eligible for importation
into the United States. Europa contends that this vehicle is eligible for importation under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30141(a)(1)(B)
because it has safety features that comply with, or are capable of being altered to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1995 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463)
MPV has safety features that comply with Standard Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence *&blank;*&blank;*
(based on visual inspection and operation), 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems (based on inspection), 104 Windshield
Wiping and Washing Systems (based on operation), 106 Brake Hoses (based on visual inspection of certification markings),
107 Reflecting Surfaces (based on visual inspection), 113 Hood Latch Systems (based on information in owner's manual
describing operation of secondary latch mechanism), 116 Brake Fluids (based on visual inspection of certification
markings and information in owner's manual describing fluids installed at factory), 119 New Pneumatic Tires for
Vehicles other than Passenger Cars (based on visual inspection of certification markings), 124 Accelerator Control
Systems (based on operation and comparison to U.S.-certified vehicles), 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact
(based on test data and certification of vehicle to European standard), 202 Head Restraints (based on test data and

205 Glazing Materials (based on visual inspection of certification markings), 207 Seating Systems, (based on test
results and certification of vehicle to European standard), 209 Seat belt Assemblies (based on certification markings),
211 Wheel Nuts, Wheel Discs and Hubcaps (based on visual inspection), 214 Side Impact Protection (based on test results),
219 Windshield Zone Intrusion (based on engineering evaluation of Standard No. 208 compliance test film and test
data), and 302 Flammability of Interior Materials (based on composition on upholstery).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner also contends that the 1995 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPV is capable
of being altered to comply with the following standards, in the manner indicated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The petitioner provided test data indicating that the vehicle satisfied the frontal barrier requirements of Standard
No. 301 Fuel System Integrity. The petitioner also supplied data on a rear barrier crash at 31 mph with crash forces
approximating those required by the standard. The data revealed that fuel leaked from the vent during the rollover
that was conducted as part of this test. The petitioner installed a rollover valve in the fuel tank line to resolve that
problem. The petitioner also stated that the vehicle should comply with the lateral impact test at the lower speed
of 20 mph due to the reinforcing structure surrounding the fuel tank and the placement of the fuel lines inside the main
frame of the vehicle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the

J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;006) has petitioned NHTSA to
decide whether 1989 Audi 100 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle which
J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1989 Audi 100 that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in,
the United States and certified by its manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1989 Audi 100 to its U.S. certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Audi 100,
as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.
certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Audi 100 is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence. *&blank;*&blank;*,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 303 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, as amended, USTR is required to publish annually the National
Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE). With this notice, the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC)
is requesting interested parties to assist it in identifying significant barriers to U.S. exports of goods, services
and overseas direct investment for inclusion in the NTE. Particularly important are impediments materially affecting
the actual and potential financial performance of an industry sector. The TPSC invites written comments which provide
views relevant to the issues to be examined in preparing the NTE.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Submissions should contain descriptions of any or all of the following nine categories of foreign trade barriers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) import policies (e.g., tariffs and other import charges, quantitative restrictions, import licensing, and
customs barriers); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) standards, testing, labeling, and certification (including unnecessarily restrictive application of phytosanitary
standards, refusal to accept U.S. manufacturers' self-certification of conformance to foreign product standards,
and environmental restrictions); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) discriminatory government procurement practices (e.g., ``buy national'' policies and closed bidding); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) export subsidies (e.g., export financing on preferential terms and agricultural export subsidies that displace
U.S. exports in third country markets); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) lack of intellectual property protection (e.g., inadequate patent, copyright, and trademark regimes); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) services barriers (e.g., limits on the range of financial services offered by foreign financial institutions,
regulation of international data flows, restrictions on the use of data processing, and quotas on imports of foreign
films); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) investment barriers (e.g., limitations on foreign equity participation and on access to foreign government-funded
R&amp;D consortia, local content, technology transfer and export requirements, and restrictions on repatriation
of earnings, capital, fees and royalties); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) anticompetitive practices tolerated by foreign governments (including anticompetitive activities of both
state-owned and private firms which apply to services or to goods and which restrict the sale of U.S. products to any
firm, not just to the foreign firms that perpetuate the practices); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) other barriers (i.e., barriers that encompass more than one category listed above or that affect a single sector).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison with last year's report, this year we are adding a new category, anti-competitive practices, to the
NTE. In addition, the standards category will now encompass restrictive foreign environmental practices, and the
investment category will cover restrictions on U.S. access to foreign government-funded research and development
(R&amp;D) consortia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Submissions should contain estimates of the potential increase in exports that would result from the removal of the
barrier, as well as a clear discussion of the method(s) by which the estimates were computed. Estimates should fall
within the following value ranges: less than $5 million; $5 to $25 million; $25 million to $50 million; $50 million
to $100 million; $100 million to $500 million; or over $500 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that interested parties discussing barriers in more than one country should provide a separate submission
for each country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of Commerce on matters related to the development of the NII. In addition, the Council shall advise the Secretary on
a national strategy for promoting the development of the NII. The NII will result from the integration of hardware,
software, and skills that will make it easy and affordable to connect people, through the use of communication and
information technology, with each other and with a vast array of services and information resources. Within the Department
of Commerce, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration has been designated to provide secretariat
services to the Council.
