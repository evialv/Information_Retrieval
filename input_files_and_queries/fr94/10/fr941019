Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has been reviewed
by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S.
grain officially tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS will be offering certification of
these specific pesticide levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service
is 500 samples per year or 10 per week. This represents approximately $100,000 per year, which will reimburse the costs
of providing the service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS has provided official pesticide residue testing under the Agricultural Marketing Act since the early 1980's.
Producers, grain handlers, processors, and foreign buyers of U.S. grain expect FGIS to provide an impartial assessment
of grain quality as required by its legislative authority. FGIS, in turn, responds to industry requests by developing
testing procedures and soliciting comments regarding the specific action before implementation. It is participants
in the grain industry who determine who should conduct the analysis based on the documentation needed to fulfill contract
requirements established by the grain market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service has determined that this proposed
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. The USGSA provides in Section 87g that no State or subdivision may require or impose any requirements
or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain under the Act. This final rule will
not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with
this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
David Shipman, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)
because most users of the official inspection and weighing services and those entities that perform these services
do not meet the requirements for small entities.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
contained in part 800 have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0580&hyph;0013.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 28, 1994, FGIS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 9424) a proposed rule entitled ``Fees for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official Pesticide Residue Testing.'' These fees were established for a new service to provide official pesticide
residue determinations for 29 pesticides in wheat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the early 1980's, FGIS has provided official service under the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) to test grain
and processed grain products for three pesticide residues: carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide, and ethylene
dibromide. This service is available upon request from the FGIS Commodity Testing Laboratory in Beltsville, MD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS is expanding its pesticide residue testing program to include testing wheat for 29 additional pesticides under
the authority of the USGSA. The service will be performed on a request basis; it will not be required for either domestic
or export shipments. All samples will be tested at the FGIS Technical Center in Kansas City, MO. A minimum of 500 grams
of wheat will be required for testing. The residues (routine compounds) that will be certified are as follows: aldrin;
azinphos-methyl; alpha-BHC; beta-BHC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta-BHC; carbofuran; chlorpyrifos; chlorothalonil; chlorpyrifos-methyl; p,p
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-DDD; p,p
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-DDE; 3-p,p
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-DDT; diclofop-methyl; dieldrin; dimethoate; endosulfan; endrin; esfenvalerate; fenitrothion; fenthion;
folpet; lindane; malathion; methidathion; methoxychlor; parathion; parathion-methyl; pirimiphos-methyl;
and triallate. These compounds will be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Laboratory analytical
results will be provided to the applicant as soon as practicable. Generally, the testing requires a minimum of 48 hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fees will be set forth in Section 800.71(a), Schedule A. The proposed fee is $200 for each sample tested during a
regular workday and $300 for each sample tested during a nonregular workday. The USGSA, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 71 et
seq.) provides that FGIS charge and collect reasonable fees that cover its estimated cost of performing official
inspection, weighing, reinspection, and appeal services. The fees are to cover, as nearly as practicable, the FGIS
costs for performance of these official services, including related administrative and supervisory costs. The
testing fee does not include charges for sampling. Sampling service fees, if required, will be assessed in accordance
with the sampling rates in Section 800.71(a), Schedule A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing for additional residues (special compounds) within FGIS capabilities will be charged at a proposed rate
of $100 per hour during a regular workday and $150 per hour during a non regular workday. Testing of residues in other
grains, oilseeds, and commodities may be provided as a service at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S.
grain officially tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS will be offering certification of
these specific pesticide levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service
is 500 samples per year or 10 per week. This represents approximately $100,000 per year, which will reimburse the costs
of providing the service.

Comment Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 30-day comment period, three comments were filed in response to the proposal. The two comments in support
of the proposal were received from a grain industry association and a state department of agriculture. A third comment
in opposition to the proposal was filed by an independent (private) laboratory association and was received after
the close of the comment period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment in support of the proposal encouraged FGIS to use statistically valid quality control methods in offering
pesticide testing. The commentor also requested that the testing not be mandatory. In addition, the commentor asked
about the memorandum of understanding between FGIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In response to the
comment, the testing service will be performed on a request basis; it will not be required for either domestic or export
wheat shipments. Grain samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have been officially sampled and determined to contain violative levels of pesticide residues will be reported
to the FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment in support of the proposal stated that the service would help to strengthen the marketing of U.S. wheat
abroad and the service would meet importers' needs for more thorough testing for pesticide residues. The commentor
also pointed out that importers often request official testing rather than what is offered by private laboratories
and that only FGIS would be able to provide a chain-of-custody for the tested products from sampling to analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third comment was received after the 30-day comment period. This comment objected to FGIS testing on the grounds
that the government would be competing with private laboratories. FGIS has provided official pesticide residue
testing under the AMA on pesticide residue since the early 1980's. Producers, grain handlers, processors, and foreign
buyers of U.S. grain expect FGIS to provide impartial assessment of grain quality as required by its legislative authority.
FGIS, is turn, responds to industry requests by developing testing procedures and soliciting comments regarding
the specific action before implementation. It is participants in the grain industry who ultimately determine who
will conduct the analysis (FGIS or independent lab) based on documentation needed to fulfill contract requirements
established by the grain market.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is publishing amendments to Regulation DD (Truth in Savings) and the official staff commentary to implement
recent changes made to the Truth in Savings Act by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act
of 1994. The law narrows the scope of accounts covered by the Truth in Savings Act to accounts held by individuals for
a personal, family or household purpose. Accounts held by unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals
are no longer subject to Truth in Savings requirements. The amendments to Regulation DD would merely implement this
change by deleting references to ``unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals.'' The Board has made
a finding that publishing a proposed amendment for comment is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest; therefore,
the amendment is adopted in final form.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) is to assist consumers in comparing deposit accounts
offered by depository institutions. Institutions must disclose fees, the interest rate, the annual percentage
yield (APY), and other account terms whenever a consumer requests the information and before an account is opened.
Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement sent to the consumer. Deposit account advertisements
and advance notices to account holders of adverse changes in terms are also covered. The act restricts how institutions
determine the account balance on which interest is calculated. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD
(12 CFR part 230). (See final rule published on September 21, 1992 (57 FR 43337), correction notice published on October
9, 1992 (57 FR 46480), and amendments published on March 19, 1993 (58 FR 15077).) An official staff commentary was published
on August 8, 1994 (59 FR 40217).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Regulatory Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 was enacted September 23, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325,
108 Stat. 2160). Section 332 of the act amends the Truth in Savings Act. The amendment narrows the scope of covered accounts
to those held by individuals primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Accounts held by unincorporated
nonbusiness associations of individuals are no longer covered by Truth in Savings, effective on the law's date of
enactment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is adopting amendments to the regulation and commentary to implement this change. The Administrative Procedure
Act provides that notice and opportunity for public comment are not required if the Board finds that notice and public
comment are unnecessary or would be contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The Board believes such a
finding is appropriate in this case. The Congress has eliminated a class of accounts from Truth in Savings coverage,
and the amendments merely effect that change. These amendments_which only delete references to accounts held by
unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals_are technical and not subject to interpretation. In light
of the Congress' action, the Board has no discretion with regard to this regulatory change. It is essentially ministerial.
The Board is required by law to amend Regulation DD in the manner proposed. This amendment to 12 CFR part 230 relieves
depository institutions from the requirement that they treat ``unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals''
as ``consumers'' under Regulation DD. Because this regulatory amendment eliminates requirements, it is effective
September, 23, 1994_the effective date of the statutory amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Board has determined that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and providing opportunity
for public comment for the following amendments is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC has adopted final amendments concerning delegations of authority and other technical amendments to its
regulations in order to reflect the name, duties and powers of the FDIC's new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs,
which was established under a recent internal reorganization. The Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs was
created by abolishing the FDIC's Office of Consumer Affairs and transferring its functions, as well as those of the
FDIC's Division of Supervision relating to compliance with consumer protection, fair lending, community reinvestment,
civil rights, and other laws not directly affecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions, to the new
division. The intended effect of these amendments is to provide officials in the new division with appropriate delegated
authority and to make other technical and conforming amendments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 29, 1994, the Acting Chairman of the Board of the FDIC approved a reorganization of the Corporation resulting
in the establishment of a new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs. This was accomplished by abolishing the
Office of Consumer Affairs and transferring its functions and duties to the new division. The functions and duties
of the Division of Supervision relating to compliance with consumer protection, fair lending, community reinvestment,
civil rights, and other laws not directly affecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions were also
transferred to the new division. The Board adopted a resolution on August 30, 1994 approving the restructuring in
order to reaffirm and strengthen its commitment to enforcing consumer protection, fair lending, community reinvestment,
and civil rights laws and to better utilize FDIC resources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FDIC has identified portions of its regulations that will be directly affected by the aforementioned corporate
reorganization and thus require modification. These amendments include delegations of authority and other technical
amendments to part 303 as well as a technical amendment to part 338.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Amendments to Part 303
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Part 303 of the FDIC's regulations generally sets forth the procedures to be followed by both the FDIC and applicants
with respect to applications, requests, or notices required to be filed by statute or regulation. Part 303 also currently
sets forth delegations of authority from the FDIC's Board of Directors to the Director of the Division of Supervision,
associate directors, regional directors and deputy regional directors of that division to act on certain applications
and other matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments primarily provide delegations of authority, where appropriate, to the Director and the regional
managers of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to act on certain matters within the purview of the new
division. The amendments also replace certain obsolete terminology and legal citations with current nomenclature
and accurate citations where applicable. Specific changes are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Scope and Definitions (&sect;303.0)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The description of the scope of part 303 has been revised to reflect the delegations of authority added to part 303 for
the new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs as well as to reflect that part 303 prescribes where applications,
requests and notices required to be filed by statute or regulation should be filed. Definitions of ``Director (DCA)''
and ``regional manager'' have been added to reflect the management of the new Division of Compliance and Consumer
Affairs. The new term ``DCA'' has been added and defined to mean the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs or
any successor thereto. The term ``Director'' has been revised to ``Director (DOS)''. The term ``Associate Director''
has been redefined to include any associate director of the Division of Supervision or the Division of Compliance
and Consumer Affairs. The revisions clarify that the terms ``associate director,'' ``regional director,'' ``deputy
regional director,'' ``Associate General Counsel for Compliance and Enforcement,'' and ``regional counsel''
include officials of equivalent authority. A definition of ``institution-affiliated party'' has replaced the
term ``individual'' throughout, incorporating by reference the meaning provided in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u). The term
``order of correction'' relating to actions terminating deposit insurance has been replaced with the term ``notification
to primary regulator,'' which is the nomenclature currently found in 12 U.S.C. 1818(a). The definition of ``notice
of assessment of civil penalties'' has been revised to conform with current law. The term ``final order to pay'' relating
to the assessment of civil money penalties has been deleted as unnecessary, and the term ``amended order to pay'' added
to provide for orders which change the amount originally assessed in civil money penalty actions. The definition
of ``total assets'' has been revised and a definition of ``Tier 1 capital'' added, incorporating by reference the
definitions found at 12 CFR 325.2(n) and (m), respectively. The term ``protest'' has been revised to reflect the appropriate
regional manager's duties with respect to Community Reinvestment Act protests. Section 303.0(c)(1) has been added
to explain that any authority delegated to the Director of the Division of Supervision or the Director of the Division
of Compliance and Consumer Affairs may be exercised by the Executive Director, Divisions of Compliance, Resolutions
and Supervision. Similarly, &sect;303.0(c)(2) explains that any authority delegated to the regional manager may,
where confirmed in writing, be exercised by his or her principal assistant. Finally, &sect;303.0(d) is added to clarify
that, if appropriate, any use of the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular and that any
use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender encompasses all three.

This section has been amended to provide delegations of authority to the Director and the regional manager of the Division
of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to authorize investigations and examinations pursuant to this section as deemed
appropriate. Upon receipt of any report of investigation or examination, authority is delegated to the Director
or regional manager of the new division to take any action determined necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

where confirmed in writing, the associate director or the appropriate regional manager, in the exercise of authority
under this section.

References throughout the section have been revised to include the authority of the Director of the Division of Compliance
and Consumer Affairs or designee to act on certain enforcement matters involving consumer compliance issues. With
respect to enforcement matters involving both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters, authority
to act is delegated to the Director of the Division of Supervision and the Director of the Division of Compliance and
Consumer Affairs, or their designees, jointly.

This section continues to allow for the delegation of authority to various Division of Supervision personnel to initiate
termination of insurance actions pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(a). However, it replaces the obsolete term, ``order
of correction'', with the current term, ``notification to primary regulator'', and provides that the delegates
may act when the insured depository institution's Tier 1 capital is less than 2% of its total assets, which is essentially
the current delegation updated to reflect changes in the capital regulations. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) modify
the certification requirements to conform with the terminology currently found in 12 U.S.C. 1818(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These sections have been changed to provide delegations of authority to both the Director of the Division of Supervision
and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to initiate actions pursuant to sections 8 (b)

of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance
matters will be addressed in the action.

In this section, the term ``individual'' is replaced with the current terminology, ``institution-affiliated party.''
The section has also been revised to provide delegations of authority to both the Director of the Division of Supervision
and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, to an associate
director to issue notices of intent to remove from office pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(e). The amendment also provides

The delegations have been revised to provide delegated authority to the Director of the Division of Supervision and
the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to issue orders of suspension or prohibition pursuant
to section 8(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). The amendment also provides for the joint issuance
of such orders by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety
and soundness and consumer compliance matters will be addressed in the action. The language has also been revised
to conform with the statute as it currently reads. Hence, the reference to ``indicted director, officer or person
participating in the conduct of the affairs'' has been replaced with ``institution-affiliated party who is charged
in any information, indictment, or complaint as set forth in section 8(g) of the Act.''

Current &sect;303.9 delegates to the Director of the Division of Supervision and, where confirmed in writing, an
associate director the authority to issue notices of assessment of civil money penalties. The amendment provides
an additional delegation of authority to the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where
confirmed in writing, to an associate director of that division. The amendment also provides for the issuance of joint
notices of assessment of civil money penalties by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer

of Liquidation and, where confirmed in writing, to an associate director or the appropriate regional director or
deputy regional director and the General Counsel or his designee to issue an order of investigation pursuant to section
10(c) of the Act. This section has been amended to include a delegation of authority to the Director of the Division
of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, to the appropriate regional manager of that division.
The amendment also provides for the joint issuance of an order of investigation by the Director of the Division of Supervision
and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance
matters will be a subject of the investigation. The reference to ``Division of Liquidation'' has been changed to ``Division
of Depositor and Asset Services'' to reflect an earlier title change for that division. The reference to the relevant
FDIC regulation is updated to specify the current citation, which is subpart K of part 308.

where a proceeding was issued jointly by DOS and DCA, both Directors, or their designees, must agree to accept, deny
or enter into any negotiations for unilateral settlement offers. Section 303.9(l) has also been amended to provide
that in cases where both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters are addressed, joint written agreements
may be entered into. Section 303.9(l)(2) has further been amended to broaden the scope of authority delegated to both
directors, and where confirmed in writing by either director, to an associate director, to accept or enter into written

unchanged, but language is added to clarify that notifications and notices are included in the types of actions that

remains substantially unchanged.

B. Amendment to Part 338 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 338 is amended by changing the address on the Equal Housing Lender Poster contained in &sect;338.4(b) of the FDIC's
regulations, 12 CFR 338.4(b), to reflect the name of the new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs.

Exemption From Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rules of agency organization, procedure or practice are exempt from public comment requirements of section 553 of
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)). The FDIC believes that it is unnecessary to seek public comment
in this case because these amendments concern rules of agency organization, procedure or practice which fall within
this exemption. Therefore, the amendments are being issued as a final, rather than proposed, rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Date of Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) generally requires that a final rule be published 30
days prior to its effective date, subject to certain exceptions. One such exception is that if an agency finds good
cause for making a rule immediately effective and publishes the basis for such finding, then the rule need not be published
30 days prior to its effective date. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). These amendments merely concern internal delegations of
authority and do not affect any substantive rights. Therefore, the FDIC Board of Directors finds good cause to waive
the 30-day delayed effective date in order to quickly effectuate the corporate reorganization and to provide the
new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs with appropriate legal authority to carry out its functions and duties.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is amending the existing regulations governing its Affordable Housing Disposition
Program (AHDP). The amendments set forth in this interim final rule are necessary because the Resolution Trust Corporation
Refinancing, Restructuring and Improvement Act of 1991 (Refinancing Act), the Departments of Veterans Affairs,
Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1992 (1992 Appropriations Act), the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Housing Act) and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion
Act of 1993 (Completion Act) changed the manner in which the RTC is to identify, market and sell certain affordable
housing properties. This interim final rule also clarifies certain policies of the RTC regarding the disposition
of assets in the AHDP and reflects certain comments received with respect to a previously published interim final
rule. By implementing the statutory changes required by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992
Housing Act and the Completion Act, and clarifying certain provisions of the AHDP and making the other changes set
forth herein, these regulations will enhance the availability and affordability of residential real property for
very-low income, lower-income and moderate-income families and individuals.

On August 31, 1990 (55 FR 35564), the RTC published a final rule establishing the procedures to be followed by the RTC
in connection with the sale of eligible residential properties to qualifying purchasers under the AHDP. Those procedures
were established in accordance with the affordable housing provisions of section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act, as amended by section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA)
(12 U.S.C. 1441a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19500), the RTC published an interim final rule and request for comments (May 6, 1992 Interim Rule).
That publication implemented some of the statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and clarified the
RTC's policies on a number of issues relating to the disposition of assets in the AHDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 12, 1992 (57 FR 24937), the RTC published an interim statement of policy. That publication provided that when
more than one multifamily property is purchased from the RTC under the AHDP, the RTC will require that not less than
15 percent of the dwelling units in each separate property purchased be made available to low or very-low income individuals.
The final statement of policy was published on August 19, 1992 (57 FR 37581) and reflected no significant changes from
the interim statement of policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule differs from the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule in several ways: (1) It implements several statutory
changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and not reflected in the May 6 1992 interim final rule; (2) It implements
a number of statutory changes made to the AHDP by the enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act
and the Completion Act; (3) It further clarifies RTC policies relating to the disposition of assets within the AHDP.

property are modified to substitute specific value limits for the former references to various sections of the National
Housing Act of 1934, as amended (National Housing Act). In order to implement section 12 of the Completion Act, the
definitions of eligible condominium property and eligible single family property are modified to permit specific
maximum values higher than those set by the National Housing Act so long as Congress has appropriated funds for such
purpose. To implement section 601 of the Refinancing Act, the definition of eligible multifamily property is modified
to permit the inclusion of conservatorship properties, if Congress appropriates funds for that purposes. Public
Citizen, Inc. requested that the definition of eligible multifamily property be extended generally to include otherwise
eligible conservatorship properties. In view of section 12 of the Completion Act, this interim final rule goes as
far in that direction as the RTC believes is permissible without a Congressional appropriation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 14(a) of the Completion Act is implemented in this interim final rule by a requirement that the RTC send
notices to clearinghouses of the availability for sale of certain properties which are ``ineligible'' under the
AHDP program. ``Ineligible properties'' include (a) properties that would otherwise be eligible condominium property
or eligible single family property, but have values above the applicable AHDP limits and within certain higher limits
set forth in the statute (if Congress has not appropriated funds to include such properties as eligible), and (b) properties
that would be eligible multifamily property but for being owned by the RTC in its capacity as conservator (if Congress
has not appropriated funds to include such properties as eligible). The clearinghouse is required to make such notice
available to qualifying purchasers, as well as other purchasers, as appropriate and technical assistance advisors
are permitted to perform a similar function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consistent with the interim and final statements of policy discussed above, the definition of lower-income occupancy
requirement(s) applicable to eligible multifamily properties sold in a bulk sale is revised to require that at least
15 percent of the units in each property must be made available for low- or very low-income families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The marketing period continues to be 97 days for eligible single family property, but the definition permits a
longer marketing period to the extent Congress appropriates funds for such purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 14(d) of the Completion Act is being implemented to increase participation by minority-owned and women-owned
businesses in the AHDP. The interim final rule requires that brokers and RTC staff provide, to a wide range of minority-owned
and women-owned businesses and minority-controlled nonprofit organizations, each engaged in providing affordable
housing, information concerning the availability of purchase money loans under section 21A(c)(6)(A)(ii) of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441a(c)(6)(A)(ii)). Clearinghouses and technical assistance advisors are
also authorized to provide such information to such parties. In addition to the explicit requirements, the interim
final rule includes various definitions concerning this aspect of the AHDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The definition of nonprofit organization is modified to limit the opportunity for for-profit individuals or
entities to benefit from such status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The definition of public agency is clarified to include entities operating under executive, legislative or judicial
authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Consistent with current RTC directive, the interim final rule requires that the RTC send clearinghouses notices
containing information concerning properties with appraised values or values determined by the RTC which exceed
the applicable AHDP values. These properties (including the ``ineligible'' single family and condominium properties
discussed in paragraph (2) above) will not be marketed or sold as a part of the AHDP, and may be sold to any purchaser if
the sales price exceeds the applicable maximum AHDP value. However, if the sales price falls below the applicable
maximum value, these ``non-AHDP properties'' may only be sold, initially, to a qualifying purchaser. This change
is consistent with a suggestion made by Public Citizen, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The RTC's authority to issue a second Notice of Marketing Period for unsold properties has been expanded to cover
single family properties and condominium units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The provisions concerning eligible multifamily properties are being clarified to reflect that if a purchaser
makes a commitment to reserve a higher proportion of properties for very low income families, that commitment must
be reflected in the LURA for such property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The provisions concerning rent restrictions applicable to AHDP properties are being clarified to reflect that
family size adjustments for purposes of determining rent will be based on unit size, rather than household size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) The provisions describing the property listing which must accompany a Notice of Marketing Period are being revised
to conform more closely to statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) In order to implement section 609 of the Refinancing Act, the RTC will be required to establish a net realizable
market value for an eligible multifamily property, which value will be a minimum sales price in all cases, except for
expedited sales to public agencies or nonprofit organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) Clarification and an addition examples are provided as to the preference given, with respect to the bulk sale
of eligible condominium properties, to sales that will benefit the larger number of very low- and low-income households.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15) The provisions concerning bulk sales of eligible condomium property and eligible multifamily property are
modified to permit the RTC, when a bulk package is being marketed, to sell individual properties to qualifying purchasers.
Public Citizen, Inc. had suggested such a revision with respect to eligible multifamily property. This interim final
rule goes a step further by making a similar revision with respect to eligible condominium property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) The provision which specifies the information to be provided in reports to Congress concerning the AHDP, has
been revised so that it more closely tracks the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(17) The provision of &sect;1609.11 which addresses public agencies that acquire properties under the AHDP has been
expanded to specify the particular lower-income requirements that apply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(18) Consistent with existing RTC policy, a new subsection 1609.9(b) has been added which provides that, with respect
to eligible multifamily property, the RTC will offer such property, initially, for direct sale exclusively to public
agencies and nonprofit organizations for a period of 45 days. If the RTC receives no notice of serious interest, the
property will be marketed pursuant to section 1609.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other stylistic changes to the regulations have also been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the length of the interim final rule and the number of changes from the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule, this interim
final rule is published in its entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative Procedure Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RTC is adopting this regulation as an interim final regulation. It will be effective immediately upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, without the usual notice-and-comment period or delayed effective date as provided for in the Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. These requirements may be waived for ``good cause''. The RTC believes that good cause exists because
the amendments made to the affordable housing provisions of FIRREA by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations
Act, the 1992 Housing Act and the Completion Act took effect immediately upon their enactment. Moreover, immediate
clarification of existing policies is necessary in order to avoid undue delays in the disposition of affordable housing
properties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By implementing these changes immediately, the RTC is complying with the mandate from Congress to dispose of single
family, multifamily and condominium properties expeditiously and to the benefit of low and moderate income households.
The immediate effective date of the regulation is also desirable in order to avoid public confusion regarding the
RTC's policies and procedures in this area. Such confusion could impede the sales of affordable housing properties
and result in deterioration of existing inventory and increased holding costs associated with these properties.
Such costs ultimately would be borne by the taxpayer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public in adopting an interim final rule outweigh any harm
from the delay in seeking public comment. The RTC solicits comments and will consider those comments in the adoption
of the rule as final, which will take place within 90 days after the close of the public period.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the following initial regulatory flexibility
analysis is hereby provided:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim final regulations. These elements have been discussed
elsewhere in the preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Impact of the interim final regulations on small businesses: This interim final rule is not expected to have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The RTC expects, rather, that the interim final regulation
will result in a benefit to small business entities whose service will be utilized in fulfilling the mandates of the
legislation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules which overlap, duplicate, or conflict
with the interim final regulations.

the same 10 eligible single family properties for $325,000 and intends to reserve all of the properties for occupancy
and purchase by lower-income families (but not very low-income families). Although Y has offered more for the properties,
the properties should be sold to nonprofit organization X for $300,000.

in interest, with the provision that the property may subsequently be sold to a lower-income family without further
deed restrictions (except applicable recapture restrictions). The LURA or other recorded legal instrument shall
also require the property owner to rent such properties at affordable rates, to cooperate with periodic compliance
reviews and to pay a reasonable fee to cover the cost of the reviews. The LURA or other recorded instrument shall reflect
any commitment, made in accordance with a purchase offer pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, to reserve

for the longest term.

Thus, for example, rent for a 3-bedroom unit occupied by a very low-income family will be based upon the HUD-determined
income for a household at 50% of area median income which has 5 members. The rent for a 2-bedroom unit occupied by a lower-income
household will be based upon the HUD figure for a household at 65% of median income which has 3 members.

sell each eligible multifamily property at a price no less than the estimated net realizable market value unless sale
at a lower price is necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of such property and to enable a public agency or nonprofit
organization to comply with the applicable lower-income occupancy requirements. If the RTC receives an offer higher

 (i) If, before the expiration of the period for submission of bona fide offers, an offer to purchase a property initially
accepted by the RTC is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the RTC shall accept another offer to purchase
the property that complies with the terms and conditions established by the RTC (if another offer was made during the
period for submission of bona fide offers). This provision does not require a qualifying multifamily purchaser whose
offer is accepted during the bona fide offer period to purchase the property before the expiration of that period.

(i) In choosing among bona fide offers for eligible multifamily property, the RTC will give preference to the offer
that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy by very low-income families and lower-income
families and would retain such affordability for the longest term (not exceeding the term of the deed restrictions).
For purposes of making calculations pursuant to this paragraph (b)(9) alone, as described in the following examples,
``lower-income families'' shall mean families and individuals whose incomes are greater than 50 percent of area
median income but do not exceed 80 percent of area median income, as defined under 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2) and as determined
by the Secretary of HUD, with adjustment for family size. The preference will be calculated in accordance with the

B offers to purchase the same eligible multifamily property for $900,000 and intends to reserve 50% of the units for
occupancy by very low-income families and 50% for occupancy by lower-income families. Multifamily purchaser C offers
to purchase the eligible multifamily property for $1,015,000 and agrees to reserve 20% of the units for occupancy

 Prior to listing an eligible condominium property with a clearinghouse, the RTC, in its sole discretion, will determine
whether to offer the property for sale individually or as part of a bulk sale package of multiple eligible condominium
properties. Subject to paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, the composition of a bulk sale package will be determined
solely by the RTC prior to listing the properties with a clearinghouse. Properties listed for sale on an individual
basis will be available for purchase by qualifying households only. Properties listed as part of a bulk sale package
may be purchased by nonprofit organizations, public agencies or for-profit entities. After 90 days of marketing,
properties listed for individual sales may be relisted as part of a bulk sale package for the remaining 90 days.

 The Secretary, the RTC or its successor, or the State housing finance agency for the State in which the property is located
may temporarily reduce the lower-income occupancy requirements applicable to a property sold under this program
if the Secretary or the applicable State housing finance agency determines that an owner's compliance with such requirements
is no longer financially feasible. The owner of the property shall make a good-faith effort to return lower-income
occupancy to the level required by the property's LURA, and the agency, as appropriate, shall review the reduction
annually to determine whether financial infeasibility continues to exist.

 In choosing among bulk purchase offers from nonprofit organizations, public agencies and for-profit entities,
the RTC will give preference to the offer that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy
or purchase by very low-income families and lower-income families and would retain such affordability for the longest
term (not exceeding the term of the LURA). The preference will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

in response to bulk sale offers with respect to which the RTC has determined to waive the 100 percent lower-income occupancy
requirement pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, 0.125% of the cash equivalent offer for each 1% of the
units set aside for occupancy by lower-income families that exceeds the applicable lower-income unit requirement;
provided, however, that very low-income units receiving a 0.25% preference for purposes of the preceding clause,

binding upon successors in interest, with the provision that the property may subsequently be sold to a lower-income
family without further deed restrictions (except for recapture restrictions). The deed or other recorded legal
instrument shall also require the property owner to cooperate with periodic compliance reviews and to pay a reasonable

(a) The RTC may, for such period of time as it determines appropriate, suspend any of the rules governing the marketing
or sale of eligible residential property set forth in this part, if during such period the RTC negotiates the sale of
any such property to a nonprofit organization or public agency. If the property is not sold pursuant to such negotiations,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When an eligible multifamily property is ready for sale, and prior to sending the Notice of Marketing Period to
clearinghouses pursuant to &sect;1609.7(b)(1) of this part, the RTC shall suspend such marketing period and offer
such property exclusively to public agencies and nonprofit organizations serving the jurisdiction or area in which
such property is located. The marketing period for direct sales to public agencies and nonprofit organizations shall
be forty-five (45) days from the date on which the notice of marketing period is mailed by the RTC. If the RTC receives
no notices of serious interest from public agencies or nonprofit organizations during such marketing period, then
the RTC shall offer such property to all qualifying multifamily purchasers pursuant to &sect;1609.7(b) of this part.

(a) To the extent practicable, within a reasonable period of time after acquiring title to any non-AHDP property (including
an ineligible condominium property or an ineligible single family property) or to an ineligible multifamily property,
the RTC shall provide written notice to the clearinghouses. For single family properties, the notice shall contain
the same information about the properties that the notice required under &sect;1609.7(a)(1)(ii) of this part contains
with respect to eligible single family properties. For multifamily properties, the notice shall contain the same
information about the properties that the notice required under &sect;1609.7(b)(1)(ii) of this part contains with
respect to eligible multifamily properties. For condominium properties, the notice shall contain the same information
about such properties as the notice required under &sect;1609.7(c)(1)(iv) of this part contains with respect to
eligible condominium properties. Each notice also shall state that the property is not being sold or marketed through
the AHDP. With respect to a non-AHDP property (including an ineligible condominium property or an ineligible single
family property), the notice shall state that any purchaser may purchase the property at a sales price above the maximum
value set out in &sect;&sect;1609.2(j)(2), 1609.2(k)(2) or &sect;1609.2(m)(2) of this part, as applicable, but
only a qualifying purchaser may purchase the property at a sales price below such maximum value.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any person or entity may purchase a non-AHDP property for a sales price above the maximum value set out in &sect;&sect;1609.2(j)(2),
1609.2(k)(2) or &sect;1609.2(m)(2) of this part, as applicable, but only a qualifying purchaser may purchase such
a property at a sales price below such maximum value. If the RTC is unable to sell a non-AHDP property in compliance with
the requirements of the preceding sentence, then the RTC may dispose of the property in such manner as it determines
appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 15, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a final rule requiring air carriers, air taxi, and
commercial operators to provide duty period scheduling limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants
engaged in air transportation and air commerce [59 FR 42974; August 19, 1994]. At the time of issuance, the burden associated
with the recordkeeping requirements had not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); therefore,
those sections of the final rule did not have an effective date. On August 17, 1994, OMB approved the burden associated
with the recordkeeping requirements under OMB Control No. 2120&hyph;0585 through July 31, 1997. The FAA hereby gives
notice of that approval and the effective date for the affected sections of the final rule. A copy of the OMB approval
may be examined in Docket No. 27229 in the FAA Rules Docket, room 915G, 800 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20591.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These special conditions are issued for Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 airplanes manufactured by Fokker Aircraft B.V.
of Schiphol the Netherlands. These airplanes are equipped with electrical and electronic systems (such as the digital
electronic flight instrument system (EFIS)), which perform critical functions. The applicable regulations do
not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of high-intensity
radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions provide the additional safety standards that the Administrator
considers necessary to ensure that the critical functions performed by these systems are maintained when the airplane
is exposed to HIRF.

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 17, 1993, Fokker Aircraft B.V. of Schiphol the Netherlands, applied for an amendment to Type Certificate
A20EU to incorporate the Model F28 Mark 0070. This airplane is a derivative of the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100, approved
April 21, 1989. The changes include: removal of two plug sections forward and aft of the wing to decrease overall length
by 182 inches; two cargo doors in lieu of three; modifications of the aft cargo door due to space constraints associated
with the shorter fuselage; one pair of Type III overwing exists in lieu of two pair, and a new nose wheel tire chine. Both
the Model F28 Mark 0070 and new production of the Model F28 Mark 0100 will incorporate a hydraulic stick pusher in lieu
of a pneumatic stick pusher, new stabilizer control unit, and a new interior. The Model F28 Mark 0070 will have a maximum
seating capacity of 79 passengers.

Amended Type Certification Basis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Fokker must show that the Model F28
Mark 0070 meets the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU,
or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application for the Model F28 Mark 0070. The regulations incorporated
by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``original type certification basis.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU for the Model F28 Mark 0070 are part 25 of the
FAR, as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;60 with certain exceptions which are not relevant to these
special conditions. In addition, Fokker has elected to show compliance with certain later requirements which are
also not relevant to these special conditions. These special conditions will form an additional part of the certification
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 because of a novel or unusual design feature,
special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent
to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).

Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended at a later date to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from
HIRF. Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters, and the growing use of sensitive electrical
and electronic systems to command and control airplanes, have made it necessary to provide adequate protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are needed for the Model F28 Mark 0070 that would require that the electrical and electronic systems
which perform critical functions such as the EFIS be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption
of function due to the effects of HIRF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the trend toward increased power levels from ground-based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems, such as the EFIS, to HIRF must be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment
through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate
level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs
1 or 2 below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18GHz.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.

As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 airplanes manufactured
by Fokker Aircraft B.V. of the Netherlands. Should Fokker apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate
to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, these special conditions would
apply to that model as well, under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 airplanes. It is
not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features
on the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The substance of the special conditions for these airplanes has been subjected to the notice and comment procedure
in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely
that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. For this reason,
and because a delay would significantly affect the certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined
that prior public notice and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these
special conditions immediately. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon issuance. The
FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response
to the prior opportunities for comment described above.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL), which appears in the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR). This rule amends the CCL by revising Export Control Classification Number (ECCN)
1C60. This ECCN controls dual-use precursors and intermediate chemicals useful in the production of chemical warfare
agents. In addition this rule makes an editorial correction by removing ECCN 1C64E for Di-isopropylcarbodiimide
(C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
538&hyph;75&hyph;0), which was inadvertently readmitted to the Commerce Control List. The changes made by this
rule are based on recent discussions in the Australia Group (AG). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, this rule revises the list of countries eligible to receive Australia Group (AG) benefits under U.S. regulations
to include the Czech Republic and remove Turkey.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the December 1993 meeting of the Australia Group, the delegates discussed certain technical revisions in the Australia
Group's harmonized controls on chemical weapons precursors. The changes discussed at the meeting were further modified
at the May 1994 meeting, and are contained in this interim rule. These changes refine the scope of controls on exports
of sample shipments and mixtures containing controlled precursor and intermediate chemicals. This rule does not
address controls on biological agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule revises ECCN 1C60, which controls precursor and intermediate chemicals useful in the production
of chemical warfare agents, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
ECCN 1C60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Note 1 to 1C60 is revised to modify the general license treatment for sample shipments containing controlled chemical
precursors to eligible destinations (all destinations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
except 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Iran, Syria, Country Groups S and Z, and countries subject to an embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury).
Previously, all 54 precursor chemicals were eligible for sample shipments. Under the revised rule &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;
0-Ethyl-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite (QL) (C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
57856&hyph;11&hyph;8), Ethylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
753&hyph;98&hyph;0), and Methylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
676&hyph;99&hyph;3) are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligible for sample shipments. General license treatment for sample shipments to eligible destinations has been
available for a single sample shipment of a 55-gallon container or less of each chemical to any one consignee per calendar
year. Exporters may continue to export a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
single 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sample shipment of a 55-gallon container (or approximately 200 kg) or less of each chemical except the three excluded
chemicals, for research or evaluation purposes to any one consignee per calendar year. The exporter is now required
to submit, to BXA within 30 days of each sample shipment, a written report on company letterhead stationery that details
the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's
name and address, and the date exported. Information contained in the reports is subject to applicable confidentiality
provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Note 2 to 1C60 is revised to modify control of exports and reexports of mixtures that contain controlled chemical
precursors. Previously, controls on controlled chemicals extended to any mixtures containing those chemicals,
unless the chemical was merely an impurity that was not intentionally added or was a normal ingredient in consumer
goods intended for retail sales. This revision adds a three tier approach to a Note regarding mixtures under ECCN 1C60.
The first tier lists three chemicals that require a validated license ``regardless of the concentrations in the mixture''.
The second tier lists twenty chemicals that require a validated license when at least one of the precursors constitutes
more than 10 percent of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis. The third tier includes the remaining precursor
chemicals, not already covered by the first two tiers, and explains that a validated license is required if at least
one of the precursors constitutes more than 25 percent of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis. The retail
product exemption is continued, regardless of percentage of the controlled chemical, provided the product is formulated
as a consumer good packaged for retail sale for personal use. The exemption for unintended impurities is removed since
such impurities generally fall within one of the applicable de minimis levels. This rule also provides a definition
of ``mixtures''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the changes made by this rule, it is the Department's position that the provisions of &sect;776.12 of the
EAR do not apply to mixtures containing controlled chemical precursors, because mixing of chemicals does not constitute
incorporation within the meaning of &sect;776.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Turkey has been removed from the list of countries excepted from the requirement for a validated license under Export
Control Classification Number (ECCN) 1C60C. Because the Government of Turkey has not adopted AG-comparable export
controls, a validated license is required for all AG-list chemical precursors identified under ECCN 1C60C until
such time as appropriate export controls are in place.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, this rule adds the Czech Republic to the list of countries exempted from certain validated license requirements
on the basis of its recent membership in the 26-nation Australia Group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule revises &sect;778.8(a)(1)(i) for conformity and consistency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Saving Clause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a result of this regulatory action that were on
dock for loading, on lighter, laden aboard an exporting carrier, or en route aboard a carrier to a port of export pursuant
to actual orders for export before October 19, 1994 may be exported under the previous general license provisions
up to and including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 16, 1994. Any such items not actually exported before midnight November 16, 1994, require a validated export
license in accordance with this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This interim rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005,
0694&hyph;0010, 0694&hyph;0023 and 0694&hyph;0067. This rule imposes a new requirement that has been submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Public burden for the collection
contained within the rulemaking is estimated to average one-half hour per response. This includes the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of the data requirements,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Security and Management Support, Room 4513, Bureau
of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 (Attn: Paperwork Reduction Project_0694&hyph;XXXX).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under sections 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, (5 U.S.C. 553), requiring notice of proposed rulemaking,
the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation
involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. No other law requires that a notice of proposed
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and
comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested
persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of their views.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period for submission of comments will close November 18, 1994. The Department will consider all comments received
before the close of the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period will be considered if possible, but their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not
accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the material be treated confidentially because
of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and materials
to the person submitting the comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public
comments on these regulations will be a matter of public record and will be available for public inspection and copying.
In the interest of accuracy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completeness, the Department requires comments in written form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will also be a matter of public record and will be available
for public review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government or foreign governments
will not be made available for public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom
of Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizing
the substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published in Part
4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying of records at the facility
may be obtained from Edward Lingelbach, Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the above
address or by calling (202) 482&hyph;5653.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission today is adopting amendments to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Schedule 14A [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;101] under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
] (the ``1934 Act'') to add a new item 22 that includes the specific requirements applicable to the proxy statements
of management investment companies (``funds'') registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;1

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
] (the ``1940 Act'') and to modify the application of certain items to fund proxy statements. Item 22 replaces rules
20a&hyph;2, 20a&hyph;3, and 20a&hyph;4 under the 1940 Act [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2 through 20a&hyph;4], which are
rescinded; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Regulation 14A [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;1] under section 14(a) of the 1934 Act [15 U.S.C. 78n(a)], Regulation 14C
[17 CFR 240.14c&hyph;1] under section 14(c) of the 1934 Act [15 U.S.C. 78n(c)], Regulation S&hyph;K [17 CFR 229 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
], and related rules to clarify the applicability of certain disclosure requirements to funds and to exempt funds
from certain proxy disclosure requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rule 30d&hyph;1 [17 CFR 270.30d&hyph;1] and Forms N&hyph;1A [17 CFR 274.11A], N&hyph;2 [17 CFR 274.11a&hyph;1],
and N&hyph;3 [17 CFR 274.11b] to conform certain disclosure requirements to the new proxy statement requirements,
and to make certain other technical and conforming changes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Form N&hyph;14 [17 CFR 239.23], the form used by funds to register securities issued in connection with business
combination transactions, to require a comparative fee table in the disclosure documents delivered in connection
with such transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments update fund proxy rules to reflect current matters on which fund shareholders are commonly asked to
vote and are designed to improve the disclosure provided to shareholders and to simplify the preparation of fund proxy
statements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting revisions to the disclosure requirements for fund proxy statements to update the proxy
disclosure requirements for funds and to simplify the preparation of fund proxies. The amendments consolidate into
a new item 22 in Schedule 14A disclosure requirements previously set forth in rules 20a&hyph;2, 20a&hyph;3, and 20a&hyph;4.
The disclosure requirements of these rules, as modified by the amendments, are incorporated in proposed item 22,
and these rules are rescinded. Item 22 includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) in paragraph (a), definitions applicable to item 22 and certain general requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) in paragraph (b), disclosure requirements applicable to solicitations in connection with the election of directors;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) in paragraph (c), disclosure requirements applicable to solicitations in connection with approval of an investment
advisory contract or an amendment thereto; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) in paragraph (d), disclosure requirements applicable to solicitations in connection with a distribution plan
pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act [17 CFR 270.12b&hyph;1]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Item 22 eliminates certain of the current disclosure requirements concerning matters that are not directly relevant
to solicitations to elect directors or to approve an investment advisory contract. Item 22 includes provisions designed
to improve the disclosure provided to shareholders, including, among other things, a table showing all compensation
paid to directors. This item also specifies information required in fund proxy statements when a fund seeks approval
of a distribution plan under rule 12b&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also is adopting other amendments to the general proxy requirements in Regulation 14A and Schedule
14A, Regulation 14C, and related requirements in Regulation S&hyph;K to accommodate item 22 and to make certain requirements
more appropriate to disclosure for funds.

I. Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 16, 1993, the Commission issued a release proposing amendments to the proxy rules applicable to funds
under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendments were intended to update the proxy rules to reflect current matters on which fund shareholders
are typically asked to vote and changes in the fund industry since the proxy rules were adopted in 1960. The amendments
also were designed to improve the disclosure provided to shareholders in fund proxy statements by placing greater
emphasis on information that is directly relevant to specific matters submitted to a shareholder vote and by eliminating
disclosure that may not be pertinent to the matters being voted upon and which is, in most cases, available in other
disclosure documents. The Commission received twelve comment letters in response to the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters generally expressed strong support for the proposed amendments. The Commission is adopting the proposed
amendments with some modifications to reflect the comments received.

A. Item 22 of Schedule 14A: Reorganization of Disclosure Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is consolidating into a new item 22 to Schedule 14A disclosure requirements set forth in rules 20a-2
and 20a-3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Previously, funds preparing proxy statements had to refer to rules under both the 1934 Act and the 1940 Act including
Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A under the 1934 Act, Regulation S-K,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and rules 20a-2 and 20a-3 under the 1940 Act. Commenters strongly supported the consolidation of proxy disclosure
requirements in item 22.

These rules are rescinded. Rule 20a-4, which requires a financial data schedule to accompany a proxy filed in connection
with certain transactions if the proxy is filed electronically, is also rescinded and incorporated in subparagraph
(a)(4) of Item 22. The other items in Schedule 14A continue to be applicable, as appropriate, to fund proxy statements.
Schedule 14A includes provisions governing the form and content of all proxy statements. It requires, among other
things, information concerning: (i) the date, time, and place of the meeting of shareholders (item 1); (ii) proposals
to amend an issuer's charter, by-laws or other corporate documents (item 19); and (iii) voting tabulation procedures
(item 21).

The Commission has adopted minor technical amendments to rule 20a-1 [17 CFR 270.20a-1], the rule that implements
the Commission's authority with respect to proxies under section 20(a) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-20(a)], to delete
references to rules 20a-2 and 20a-3 and to add references to, among other things, Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A.
In addition, the filing fee requirement in rule 20a-1(c) [17 CFR 270.20a-1(c)] has been moved to subparagraph (a)(2)
of item 22.

1. Proxy Statement Format; Summary Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Item 22, as proposed, included a new requirement concerning the format for disclosure when one proxy statement solicits
shareholder votes for more than one fund or multiple portfolios of series investment companies (``series funds'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This manner of solicitation, while more efficient and less costly, may be confusing to shareholders. Therefore,
to assist shareholders in identifying proposals applicable to their fund or portfolio, the Commission proposed
to require a fund to include a table at the beginning of the proxy statement that summarizes each proposal and indicates
which fund or series shareholders are being requested to approve each proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A series fund is a fund comprised of two or more portfolios, each of which has a distinct investment objective with assets
specifically allocated to that portfolio; investors' interests in such a fund are limited to those portfolios in
which they invest. Each portfolio operates for many purposes like a separate fund, although the portfolios are all
part of the same business entity with one board of directors. Series funds are specifically permitted under section
18(f)(2) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-18(f)(2)].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters opposed the proposed tabular format, asserting that funds should have the flexibility to present
the information in other formats. The Commission believes that the tabular format affords ample flexibility for
funds to present the information they believe is important, while providing the advantages of a uniform format. The
Commission is adopting the proposed item with one change from the proposal:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the summary table requirement, as adopted, also applies to proxy statements for multiple class funds containing
multiple proposals affecting different classes.

Subparagraph (a)(3)(ii) of item 22. The table would not be required if the proxy statement solicits a vote or votes
on the same proposal or proposals from all fund or series shareholders. To assure that shareholders are not confused
in casting their vote, a separate proxy card is required for each fund, portfolio, or class.

Multiple class funds issue more than one class of securities, with each class typically subject to a different distribution
arrangement, but representing interests in the same portfolio of investments. Currently, funds must obtain exemptive
orders to implement these type of arrangements. The Commission recently proposed rule and form amendments that would
permit a fund to issue multiple classes of securities without the need for an exemptive order. Investment Company
Act Rel. No. 19955 (Dec. 16, 1993) [58 FR 68074 (Dec. 23, 1993)].

2. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed in paragraph (a) of item 22 definitions for certain terms used in item 22. The definitions
are adopted substantially as proposed with some modifications to reflect comments on the scope of two of the definitions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the definition of ``fund complex'' has been modified. The proposed amendments would require disclosure of
certain information if a fund director serves as director of more than one fund in a ``fund complex,'' including, for
example, the aggregate compensation paid to a director who serves on a number of boards in a fund complex.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As proposed, item 22(a) defined a ``fund complex'' as two or more funds with a common investment adviser (or which have
advisers that are affiliates) or, with respect to open-end funds, a common principal underwriter. The Proposing
Release requested comment on whether the definition should include groups of funds with common administrators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes it is important to define fund complex in a manner that will result in disclosure of information
about directors (particularly concerning compensation) serving on the boards of related funds. As some commenters
pointed out, many funds may have common principal underwriters or administrators that solely provide services to
the fund but are otherwise not associated with the fund, and therefore would not be commonly understood to be part of
a group of related funds. Other similar definitions of ``group'' or ``family'' of investment companies address this
issue by specifying that the funds hold themselves out to investors as related companies for the purposes of investment
and investor services, in addition to sharing a principal underwriter.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has decided to define fund complex as two or more funds that hold themselves out to investors as related
companies or that have a common investment adviser.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes the information about directors on the boards of funds that are marketed to investors as related
funds (regardless of whether they have a common principal underwriter or administrator) is important to shareholders.
In addition, the Commission believes that an investment adviser typically has such an important role in a fund's activities
that the definition of fund complex should include funds with common investment advisers regardless of whether the
funds hold themselves out as related companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, as suggested by several commenters, the Commission has deleted the definition of ``distributor.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This definition was intended to identify persons involved in distributing fund shares for purposes of other disclosure
items that are designed to elicit disclosure about relationships between fund directors (who vote on Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plans) and persons involved in distributing fund shares that could involve conflicts of interest. Commenters argued
that, because many persons or firms may provide distribution services to a fund, the definition would likely result
in the disclosure of large amounts of information much of which would be immaterial because many of the persons involved
have a minor role in the distribution of fund shares. The Commission has eliminated the definition and has modified
the disclosure concerning Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans to require information concerning only those persons receiving
significant payments from the fund for distribution services.

3. Comparative Fee Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, item 22(a) would require fund proxy statements seeking approval of proposals that would increase fees
or expenses, directly or indirectly, to include a comparative fee table showing the amount of fees and expenses currently
paid by fund shareholders and the amount of fees and expenses shareholders would have paid if the matter being voted
on had been in effect. Some commenters suggested that the fee table requirement be combined with a materiality limitation,
either for indirect fee increases or for increases in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
fees, direct or indirect. The Commission believes that shareholders should see the effects of any increases in fees.
Moreover, limiting the requirement to material increases in fees would necessarily introduce more variability,
and possibly uncertainty, into a determination of when the requirement is applicable. Therefore, the Commission
is adopting the fee table requirement as proposed.

15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Subparagraph (a)(3)(iv) of item 22. The comparative fee table would be required if any of the fee categories in the
fee table would be increased (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Management Fees, 12b&hyph;1 Fees, Other Expenses) regardless of whether total expenses would be increased, but
would not be required if a proposal's effect on expenses is speculative. A sample fee table is attached as an appendix
to this release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also proposed to amend Form N&hyph;14, the form used by funds to register securities issued in certain
investment company merger transactions, to require a comparative fee table for the combined fund. Commenters supported
the addition of the comparative fee table to Form N&hyph;14, and the Commission is adopting the amendments as proposed.
Paragraph (a) of item 3 of Form N&hyph;14.

4. Voting Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, item 22(a) would include a requirement that a fund state in the proxy statement whether it intends to inform
shareholders of the voting results in a shareholder report or other document transmitted to shareholders. Some commenters
had reservations about the voting results statement because, among other things, their experience did not suggest
that shareholders had a significant interest in the information. In addition, commenters objected to a requirement
for a negative statement if the fund does not plan to provide voting results in a subsequent shareholder report. In
lieu of the proposed disclosure requirement, the Commission is adopting an express requirement that funds report
voting results in the fund's next annual or semi-annual report. The Commission is amending rule 30d&hyph;1 to require
a report of voting results in the annual or semi-annual report to shareholders. The Commission believes that this
approach will assure that voting result information is available to shareholders and eliminate any necessity for
funds to make a negative statement regarding the availability of voting results in proxy statements.

The Commission proposed a number of revisions to the proxy disclosure requirements relating to the election of directors,
primarily to focus the requirements on information directly relevant to the qualifications, background, and relationships
of directors and to eliminate information that is not pertinent to the election of directors. The proposed revisions
included eliminating detailed disclosure concerning the investment adviser (including a certified balance sheet
of the adviser),

list, the proxy statement identify the fund complex and the number of directorships. Commenters generally supported
this revision to the disclosure of other directorships, and the Commission is adopting the modification as proposed.

D. Management Compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fund proxy statements are required to include information about the compensation of fund directors and officers
in connection with the election of directors or proposals seeking shareholder approval of benefit plans in which
directors or officers will participate. These requirements have been included in item 8 of Schedule 14A, which references
Regulation S&hyph;K and fund registration statement forms.

 The Commission proposed amendments to consolidate the disclosure requirements for management compensation paid
by funds to directors and officers in paragraph (b) of item 22, to reformat the requirements, and to expand the information
provided for directors, in particular, adding disclosure of the aggregate compensation of directors who serve on
the board of more than one fund in a fund complex.

The Commission also proposed to amend fund registration statements to require a statement in the prospectus that
information about director and officer compensation and the background of fund management is available in the Statement
of Additional Information (``SAI''). Upon consideration of the comments, the Commission believes the general statement
in the prospectus about the availability of information in the SAI is sufficient notice for shareholders and has not
included this requirement in the final rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of these changes were generally supported by the commenters. Commenters, however, were evenly divided on the
proposed disclosure of aggregate fund compensation paid to directors. The aggregate compensation disclosure was
proposed in recognition that directors often receive substantial annual fees for their service on a number of boards
in a fund complex, and that disclosure of only the compensation they receive from a single fund does not provide a complete
picture of director compensation. Commenters opposed to the disclosure asserted, among other things, that disclosure
of aggregate compensation could overshadow some of the benefits associated with directors serving on a number of
fund boards (such as development of expertise in fund issues and cost-savings) or ignore the necessity of paying adequate
compensation to attract well-qualified directors. Several commenters noted that because directors determine
their level of compensation, which is paid by the fund, the compensation received from other related funds is not indicative
of a conflict of interest or lack of independence from the investment adviser. Whether or not they supported disclosure
of aggregate fund complex compensation, many of the commenters specifically objected to what they considered to
be implications in the Proposing Release that compensation could compromise a director's independence or that directors
are not responsibly discharging their statutory and regulatory role. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the nature and amount of a director's aggregate compensation from a fund complex is useful
information that funds should provide to shareholders. Whether the amount of compensation affects a director's
independence is only one of many possible inferences a shareholder may draw from compensation information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another inference may be that the fund is overpaying directors; another may be that the fund is not obtaining the best
quality directors because they are underpaid; and still another inference may be that the amount of compensation
is commensurate with the level of expertise, oversight, and effort that directors provide to the fund. The Commission
believes that the possibility that unwarranted inferences may result from the disclosure of compensation information
is not an appropriate basis to eliminate a requirement for information about directors that will improve shareholders'
understanding of the compensation paid to directors and that is readily available to funds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the Commission is adopting the revised compensation disclosure requirements as proposed.

The Commission believes that the receipt of a substantial amount of compensation from a fund complex is not necessarily
determinative of the director's independence. The amount of compensation received, however, could be one factor
to be considered in evaluating the independence of a fund director from fund management.

Subparagraph (b)(6) of item 22. Paragraph (ii) of subparagraph (b)(6) has been revised to make it clear that the material
terms of compensation arrangements with directors other than the typical directors' fees disclosed in the compensation
table, including, for example, consulting arrangements, must be described. Such arrangements, however, could
raise the issue of whether a director has a material business or professional relationship with the fund and could
be found to be an ``interested'' director under section 2(a)(19)(A)(vi) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;2(a)(19)(A)(vi)].

The compensation disclosure required for fund officers would remain the same under the proposed amendments except
for minor revisions. Because most funds are externally managed, fund executive officers generally do not have formal
management roles and receive no compensation from the fund. As currently required, however, compensation received
by the three highest paid executive officers having aggregate compensation from a fund (but not the fund complex)
exceeding $60,000 would have to be disclosed in the compensation table. To make the disclosure of management compensation
uniform, the compensation disclosure required to appear in the SAI portion of a fund's registration statement is
amended to be consistent with item 22. Forms N&hyph;1A (item 14), N&hyph;2 (item 18), and N&hyph;3 (item 20).

The Commission also is adopting, as proposed, an additional disclosure requirement concerning investment advisory
fees. If a change in the investment advisory fee is sought, subparagraph (c)(9) of item 22 requires disclosure of the
aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fee for the last year, the amount the adviser would have received had
the proposed fee been in effect, and the percentage amount of the proposed increase.

The Commission is eliminating some of the requirements that funds provide information about brokerage practices
because the requirements have not provided investors with information that is helpful in making a decision whether
to vote for or against an investment advisory contract. The Commission continues to be concerned about fund brokerage
practices. Recently, the Commission proposed amendments to Form N&hyph;1A that, if adopted, would require certain
expenses paid by directed brokerage to be treated as an expense in fund financial statements and the fee table, and
would require average brokerage commission rates to be disclosed in the Financial Highlights Table in fund prospectuses.

2. Material Factor Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to require a discussion of material factors considered by the board of directors in recommending
that fund shareholders approve an investment advisory contract. As proposed, the item enumerated certain material
factors that might be included in the discussion. Several commenters objected to enumerated material factors arguing
that such a requirement would lead to formalistic and ``boiler plate'' disclosure and may tend to oversimplify the
board's evaluation process. The Commission believes that the material factors discussion should reflect the board
of directors' evaluation of the investment advisory contract and shares commenters' concern that enumeration of
factors might lead to ``boiler plate'' disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the Commission has decided not to include a list of material factors in the requirement for a discussion
of the recommended investment advisory contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to amend the proxy rules to set forth certain disclosure requirements for proxy statements
seeking approval of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan and plan amendments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These proposed requirements reflected, in many respects, disclosure currently made in proxy statements. Commenters
generally supported the proposed express disclosure requirements for Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans, and the Commission
is adopting item 22(d) substantially as proposed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Item 22(d) requires: (i) a description of the proposed action and the reasons shareholders are being requested to
vote on adoption (or amendment) of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (ii) disclosure of material differences between the proposed
and the current Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (iii) disclosure about distribution expenses under the plan paid by the fund
during the last fiscal year to the fund's investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, or any of their
affiliated persons, and to persons receiving 10% or more of the fund's aggregate distribution fees; and (iv) disclosure
about the factors the board of directors considered in recommending adoption of (or amendment to) the Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plan.

that would materially increase the amount spent for distribution.

G. Annual Report Delivery Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 14a&hyph;3(b) [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;3(b)] under the 1934 Act requires that, when directors are to be elected
at an annual or special shareholder meeting, registrants, including funds, furnish each person solicited with a
proxy statement that is accompanied or preceded by an annual report to shareholders. Most non-investment company
registrants hold annual meetings to elect directors, and, in many cases, the annual report delivery requirement
under rule 14a&hyph;3(b) is the only requirement that shareholders receive an annual report. Funds, on the other
hand, are subject to express annual (and semi-annual) shareholder reporting requirements under section 30(d) of
the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;29(d)] and rule 30d&hyph;1, regardless of whether they hold annual meetings, and
fund shareholder meetings may not coincide with the mailing of the annual shareholder report.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 To clarify the annual report delivery requirements for funds, the Commission proposed to amend rule 14a&hyph;3(b)
to set forth the conditions under which a fund's annual report previously transmitted to shareholders as required
under rule 30d&hyph;1 would satisfy the rule.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission requested comment on other alternatives for the annual report delivery requirement, including whether
it might be appropriate to eliminate the proxy annual report requirement for funds in light of the reports required
to be transmitted to shareholders semi-annually under rule 30d&hyph;1.

Funds generally are not required under state law or the 1940 Act to hold annual shareholder meetings. Funds schedule
shareholder meetings as necessary to elect directors, to approve investment advisory contracts or Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plans, or to vote on other matters requiring shareholder approval.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, an annual report transmitted to shareholders two months before the date of the proxy statement would
satisfy the delivery requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3(b). Where more than two months has elapsed, the rule 14a&hyph;3(b)
annual report delivery requirement would be satisfied if: (i) the fund mails the proxy statement at least 30 days prior
to the meeting; (ii) the proxy statement includes a prominent statement that the most recent annual report and any
subsequent semi-annual report will be delivered to shareholders, upon written or oral request, without charge;
and (iii) if requested by a shareholder, the annual report and, if available, the semi-annual report is transmitted
within two business days of the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters supported the proposed clarification of the annual report delivery requirement. Other commenters,
however, urged the Commission to eliminate the requirement and to substitute a requirement that the proxy statement
include a legend advising shareholders that an annual report is available upon request. These commenters argued
that the shareholder reporting requirements of the 1940 Act make the proxy annual report requirement superfluous.
Commenters also noted that the primary effect of the annual report requirement is to impose restrictions on holding
shareholder meetings because meetings can not be scheduled when the annual report for the preceding fiscal year is
not yet available after the end of the fiscal year. In some cases, a fund complex may wish to make a combined proxy mailing
for several funds to reduce the expense of the proxy solicitation; however, a joint proxy statement may be precluded
if some of the funds have different fiscal years for which the annual report is not available.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 These commenters argued that the cost of mailing an annual report with the proxy statement to new shareholders who
have not received an annual report can be substantial, and these expenses are borne by the fund's shareholders.

The Commission agrees that the costs imposed on funds and their shareholders outweigh the benefits of requiring that
annual reports accompany a proxy statement. At the time of a proxy solicitation, shareholders who have recently invested
in a fund will have received a current prospectus and other shareholders will have received either an annual or semi-annual
report within six months of receiving the proxy statement. In addition, most funds transmit to shareholders quarterly
account statements providing information about fund performance. In contrast with the timeliness of information
provided under the 1940 Act's reporting regime, rule 14a&hyph;3(b) requires delivery of a fund annual report that
may be, in some cases, almost twelve months old. Thus, this requirement has the unintended and anomalous effect of
requiring delivery of an annual report the information in which may have been superseded by information in a more recent
semi-annual report. Moreover, as applied, the current requirements impose significant restraints on the timing
of shareholder meetings and may add substantial costs to holding meetings when, for example, accountants must perform
an audit on an expedited basis. Therefore, the Commission is revising rule 14a&hyph;3(b) to eliminate the annual
report delivery requirement for funds.

Paragraph (4) of rule 14a&hyph;3(b) requires the annual report to include information concerning changes in and

[17 CFR 229.304]. The Commission is preserving this requirement for funds by amending the shareholder report financial
statement requirements set forth in rule 30d&hyph;1 by reference to the applicable item in the registration statement
forms (new instruction 4(iv) of item 23 of Form N&hyph;1A; new instruction 4(c) of item 23 of Form N&hyph;2; and new

H. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting two other amendments to the general proxy provisions. First, the Commission is amending
rule 14a&hyph;3(e)(2) [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;3(e)(2)], which relieves funds of the obligation to deliver proxy and
other soliciting materials to shareholders whose dividend payments are returned as undeliverable, to relieve funds
(and other registrants) of the delivery obligation when dividend reinvestment confirmations are returned as undeliverable.
Second, the Commission is amending Item 3 of Schedule 14A, which requires a description of appraisal or similar rights
under state law applicable to any matter being acted upon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mergers and other fundamental corporate transactions), to make it expressly inapplicable to open-end funds.
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 The 1940 Act, which requires open-end funds to redeem their securities at net asset value,
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 supersedes state law appraisal rights.

I. Date of Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new amendments to the proxy rules are effective on November 23, 1994. Funds may file, at their option, proxy statements
prepared in accordance with the new rules on or after the effective date. Funds must comply with the new rules for all
proxy statements filed on or after January 23, 1995. During the transition period between the effective date and the
compliance date, funds should state in the cover letter submitting the proxy statement whether the proxy statement
is prepared using the new rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Cost/Benefit of the Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to the proxy rules, as adopted, are intended to improve the disclosure provided to fund shareholders
in proxy statements. The amendments are not expected to impose additional burdens on funds. The amendments eliminate
a substantial amount of ``boiler plate'' disclosure regarding matters that may not be relevant to shareholders.
The additional information required by the amendments is readily available, and the elimination of the annual report
requirement in connection with the proxy statement should provide funds with greater flexibility in scheduling
shareholder meetings and reduce related expenses.

 The Secretary amends the final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures under the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct
Loan) Program to add the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers to certain sections of the Standards,
Criteria, and Procedures. Those sections contain information collection requirements approved by OMB. The Secretary
takes this action to inform the public that these requirements have been approved, and therefore affected parties
must comply with them.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 1, 1994, final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 governing the repayment and consolidation of loans under the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program in
the academic year beginning July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34278). Compliance with information collection requirements in 34
CFR 685.209, 685.213, 685.214, and 685.215 was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980. On September 23, 1994 OMB approved those information collection requirements under that Act;
therefore affected parties must now comply with those requirements.

Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does
not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed
rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under
5 U.S.C 553(d)(3).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 4, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP).
The SIP revision consists of amendments to Virginia's definition of the term volatile organic compound (VOC), administrative
changes to Virginia's lists of emission control areas, and the addition of a new emission statement regulation. The
portion of Virginia's November 4, 1992 SIP revision submittal pertaining to emission statements is the subject of
a separate rulemaking action.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1990, amendments to the 1977 Clean Air Act were enacted. Under the amended Act, EPA and the States were
required to review the designation of areas and to redesignate areas as nonattainment for ozone if the air quality
data from 1987, 1988, and 1989, indicated that the area was violating the ozone standard. On November 6, 1991, and November
30, 1992, EPA promulgated designations pursuant to the amended Act, which expanded the boundaries of the Washington,
DC, Richmond, and Hampton Roads nonattainment areas. 56 FR 56694 and 57 FR 56762. The Washington, DC nonattainment
area was extended to include Stafford County; the Richmond nonattainment area was expanded to include Charles City
County, Colonial Heights County, Hanover County, and Hopewell County; and the Hampton Roads nonattainment area
was expanded to include James City County, York County, Poquoson County, and Williamsburg City.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is EPA's evaluation of the SIP revisions submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Detailed descriptions
of the amendments addressed in this document, and EPA's evaluation of the amendments, are contained in the technical
support document (TSD) prepared for this revision. Copies of the TSD are available from the EPA Regional office listed
in the

Commonwealth's Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Section 120&hyph;01&hyph;02 has been amended to revise the definition of the term volatile organic compound
(VOC) to be consistent with EPA's definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Appendix P, which contained a list of VOC emission control areas, has been amended to include a list of emission
control areas for oxides of nitrogen (NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission control areas correspond to the ozone nonattainment designations which EPA issued in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992. 56 FR 56694 and 57 FR 56762.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The list of VOC emission control areas in appendix P was revised to correspond to the ozone nonattainment area designations
which EPA issued in the

EPA's Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments are administrative in nature, and will have no adverse effect on air quality. These amendments are
consistent with EPA requirements, and consequently serve to strengthen the Virginia SIP. Therefore, they are approvable
as a revision to the Virginia SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will become effective December 19, 1994 unless, by November 18, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final
rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on December 19, 1994.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving amendments to Virginia's definition for the term VOC and lists of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission control areas, section 120&hyph;01&hyph;02 and appendix P, respectively, as a revision to the Virginia
SIP. The Commonwealth of Virginia submitted these amendments to EPA as a SIP revision on November 4, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 19, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2)).

In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 6, 1991 (56 FR 25993), the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued an interim rule to revise the regulations
for the CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;102) and the CCC Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program
(GSM&hyph;103) administered by FAS, USDA on behalf of CCC, pursuant to program regulations codified at 7 CFR Part
1493 and through the issuance of ``Program Announcements'' and ``Notices to Participants'' that are consistent
with, and in addition to, these program regulations. The interim rule incorporated or withdrew all previously outstanding
operational requirements announced by FAS/USDA through Notices to Participants. The interim rule also incorporated
requirements established by the 1990 Act. Finally, the interim rule clarified several provisions previously contained
in 7 CFR Part 1493 to promote more efficient administration of the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs. The deadline
for comments on the interim rule was August 5, 1991. Comments were received from five U.S. exporters (one exporter
submitted two separate responses), three producer associations, two U.S. financial institutions, one U.S. export
trade association, and one U.S. Government agency. These thirteen parties made approximately 66 separate and significant
comments regarding either the interim rule or the policy issues and the impact of policies involved in administering
the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs.

General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter disagreed with CCC's statement that it has been determined that this rule will not result in ``significant
adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-based
enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.'' This respondent shared
that while the interim rule contained some improvements, some of the changes would restrict the competitiveness
of, and be detrimental to, the sale of U.S. goods. The commenter argued that the interim rule was an overreaction resulting
from the Iraqi default on GSM&hyph;102/103 guaranteed obligations. The commenter acknowledged that the U.S. Government
must monitor the programs to prevent abuse but contended that, in general, free market conditions should prevail.
While CCC agrees that the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs should avoid unduly restricting normal commercial practices,
the Department has been mandated by Congress to implement measures to guard against program abuse. It is the Department's
intention to adopt necessary program safeguards while still enhancing the ability of U.S. exporters to compete in
foreign markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters supported and commended the USDA's efforts to catalogue and codify many of the operational features
of the programs, to assure that the regulations are being met, and to create more accountability within the programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four other commenters felt that the intention of the interim rule to ``*&blank;*&blank;* simplify material, enhance
clarity, eliminate duplication and facilitate their use *&blank;*&blank;*'' has not been met. These commenters
stated that the interim rule is complicated, unclear at some points, and unnecessarily duplicative. The commenter
argued and that, more than ever, the regulations contain burdensome regulatory features which could constrain the
programs' effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the interests of program simplification have been abandoned and that undue burdens are being
placed on participants to protect the programs from a few perceived manipulations. This commenter suggested that
the program is not ``user friendly'' when administrators focus only on protecting the programs from all risk, or on
shifting all risk to the exporter or buyer. Another respondent felt that the lack of USDA guidance on pertinent issues
is not only frustrating, but may have also compromised the strengths of the U.S. agricultural system. CCC agrees that
the interim rule contains regulatory features that place additional burdens on program participants, such as added
certification statements, requirements to maintain arrival documentation, and longer retention time on transaction
records. Although such requirements may compare unfavorably with the simplicity of the prior regulations, these
requirements are mandated by the 1990 Act. On the other hand, CCC has also made changes that consolidate program requirements.
For example, policy and additional program requirements previously contained in a number of Notices to Participants
were incorporated into the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters felt that the revised regulations are a response to criticism of the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs and
pressure on program administration brought on by prior audits and investigations by the General Accounting Office
and USDA's Office of the Inspector General. Another commenter stated that since auditors do not create exports for
the U.S. economy and have no responsibility for market development there is a need to re-establish teamwork between
FAS and the export community to resolve key issues. One commenter felt the intent of the 1990 Farm Bill was to streamline
program procedures, but, in actuality, the programs are more bureaucratic than ever. This same commenter felt that
the USDA has forgotten that the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs are commercial programs, that the programs must reflect
commercial realities, and that recent studies and audits have not focused on the commercial and competitive viability
of the GSM&hyph;102/103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC acknowledges these concerns. In addressing audit and investigation reports on its commercial export programs,
CCC has attempted to put in perspective the relatively low incidence of program violations in the programs. However,
given that many of the requirements of the interim rule aimed at preventing program abuses were mandated by the 1990
Act, CCC cannot concur that the primary legislative intent was to ``streamline procedures.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three respondents recommended that the interim rule be revised to allow financial institutions to use the commercial
banking practice of securitization as a financing technique for CCC-guaranteed credits. Securitization would
involve the packaging of such credits by a U.S. financial institution for sale to third parties as U.S.-government
guaranteed securities. It is asserted that securitization would expand sources, and perhaps reduce the cost, of
financing for CCC-guaranteed credits. However, respondents point out that certain program regulations and CCC
policies now make securitization infeasible. For example, regulations require that the guarantee holder who has
experienced a default and filed a claim with CCC must turn all recoveries ``from any source whatsoever'' over to CCC
for pro rata sharing (&sect;1493.130(b)(1)). This provision is intended to ensure that the U.S. party financing
the transaction always remains at risk for the portion of the credit and interest not guaranteed by CCC. Generally,
this policy is seen as incompatible with the issuance of 100% U.S. Government-guaranteed securities since any collateral
put up by the foreign borrower to cover the portion not guaranteed by CCC could be subject to pro-rata sharing with CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, U.S. banks point out that the unwillingness of CCC to pre-approve export and other documents that must
be submitted to support a claim on CCC in the event of default makes it impossible to issue high grade securities based
on CCC-guaranteed credits. Without pre-approval, such securities could not be marketed with absolute assurance
that claims on CCC for defaults on the underlying credits would be found in good order and honored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has considered these and other proposals for securitization of CCC-guaranteed credits. However, CCC remains
of the view that, although the degree of risk-sharing may be adapted to meet program objectives, requiring risk-sharing
with the holder of the guarantee (normally a U.S. bank) is an essential feature of the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs.
It forces the private sector to engage in risk assessment relating to individual transactions, and thereby supplements
the risk assessment done by CCC prior to announcing export credit guarantee programs for specific countries. Removing
this requirement would also reduce the incentive banks now have to press for recovery of late payments from foreign
banks rather than claiming immediately on CCC. CCC does not have the resources that would be required to pre-approve
documents and to effectively manage the increase in claims and follow-up recovery efforts that would go hand-in-hand
with changing the specified provisions of the GSM&hyph;102/103 regulations to facilitate securitization. For
these reasons, CCC is not prepared at this time to propose program changes to facilitate securitization of its credit
guarantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received regarding republishing the rule. One respondent suggested that the USDA republish the
regulations on a routine basis, requesting public comments, to insure that improvements in the programs may be continually
advocated and effected. Another commenter suggested a redraft of areas of greatest controversy and republication
with request for comments. CCC agrees that the GSM&hyph;102/103 program regulations are important and should be
reviewed periodically. It is CCC's policy to do this. However, publication of an additional interim rule at this time
would further delay implementation of a final rule which is needed to establish a basic permanent framework for the
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the delays in the administrative process increase exporter risks and costs and inhibit the
programs' effectiveness. This respondent recommended that the regulations include absolute deadlines governing
the USDA's performance of administrative functions. CCC recognizes that administrative delays in processing applications
and issuing guarantees may result in additional costs and risks to exporters, and CCC is, therefore, committed to
expediting existing administrative procedures. However, it is not feasible to establish absolute time-frames
for actions because many administrative delays may be due to the failure of participants to provide all required information,
or are the unavoidable consequence of increased program activity during specific time periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent recommended that a special trade advisory committee be established to address controversial provisions
of program regulations. The commenter called on the Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee (APAC) and the Agricultural
Technical Advisory Committee (ATAC) to devote attention to these programs. CCC disagrees that a special trade advisory
committee is warranted. Considerable debate was aired when Congress developed the 1990 Act which mandated changes
to the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs. The Department also has considerable experience in administering credit and
credit guarantee programs, and has a continuing dialogue with private sector program participants on administrative
and other program policies. CCC believes that the rulemaking process should remain the primary vehicle for obtaining
views of interested parties. This process gives an equal opportunity to all parties, is part of the public record,
and is required by law. The APAC and ATAC could consider GSM&hyph;102/103 issues if their members so choose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that solutions to some of the problems are simply to modify the regulations, but other problems
require a comprehensive policy review by USDA policy officials. Another commenter supported a special credit facility
separate from the regular GSM&hyph;102/103 programs for the former Republics of the Soviet Union. These comments,
by their own admission, address concerns outside the content of the program regulations and therefore, are not considered
in this final rule.

The numbering system of the final rule differs somewhat from that of the interim rule. Some sections were added, some
were deleted. For the purposes of this discussion, the numbering system of the final rule will be used, except where
otherwise indicated. In addition to changes resulting from comments from interested parties, some additional changes
in language have been incorporated into the final rule for the purpose of clarification of specific provisions. These
changes are minor and not of a substantive nature.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt that, because of problems which previously impeded the timely provision of the credits to the republics
of the former Soviet Union, USDA needs to elaborate its ``creditworthiness'' criteria and should consider revising
current restrictions and limits on credit that make it difficult for many debt-burdened countries to participate
in the program. CCC notes that the 1990 Act prohibits export credit guarantees from being used ``for foreign aid, foreign
policy, or debt rescheduling purposes'' and instructs that CCC ``shall not make credit guarantees available in connection
with sales of agricultural commodities to any country that the Secretary determines cannot adequately service the
debt associated with such sale.'' Under this legislative mandate, CCC believes that the criteria of &sect;1493.4
cannot be changed in ways to meet the objective suggested by the commenter.

Eight respondents commented on &sect;1493.20(f), Discounts and Allowances. All comments, in one way or another,
recommended changes to this section to permit discounts and allowances that are consistent with customary commercial
trade practices. The commenters suggested specifically excluding from the definition of discounts and allowances:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Cash payments, under the terms of the export sales contract, made by the exporter to the financing institution
which reduce the amount financed and are notified to CCC as amendments to port value or export value as appropriate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Credits against the sales price, under the terms of the export sales contract, which reduce the amount of CCC coverage
and are notified to CCC as amendments to the port value and exported value, as appropriate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cash payments by the exporter to third parties for demurrage, detention and overage insurance premiums; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Adjustments for destination weights in cotton sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The payments or credits described in comments (1) and (2) above, are discounts or allowances to the importer; however,
if properly reported to CCC and the amount of CCC's coverage consequently reduced, no program violation is involved.
CCC has, therefore, determined not to include these suggested exemptions in 1493.20(f). Items (3) and (4) are addressed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the definition of discounts and allowances should be revised to delete reference
to demurrage and detention settlements. The commenter stated that demurrage and detention settlements are normal
costs which may be incurred in an export sales transaction. When settlement funds are paid to an importer, the importer
is only acting as an intermediary in making these payments to a third party, i.e., the shipping line. Thus the financial
transaction between exporter and importer is unaffected. Similarly, payments of over-age insurance premiums to
underwriters because of an exporter's inability to otherwise charter a vessel of required specifications should
not be considered a discount or allowance to the importer. CCC concurs with these comments and has therefore, deleted
reference to demurrage and detention in the definition of discounts and allowances in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents felt that there is a contradiction in the USDA's interpretation of &sect;1493.20(f). When a weight
increase occurs at destination, CCC makes no provision for amending the exported value to increase coverage. However,
when destination weights decrease, any adjustment by the exporter in favor of the importer is considered by CCC as
a discount or allowance and CCC requires that the value of the guarantee be correspondingly reduced. The respondents
argue that there should be consistent treatment in both cases, and that as long as there is coverage available from
the country line, adjustments to exported value should be made for both weight increases or decreases. CCC disagrees.
To guard against potential program abuse, CCC has instituted a system to price review all transactions for which GSM&hyph;102/103
guarantees are sought. The purpose of the price review is to insure that the sales price of the transaction being guaranteed
falls within a reasonable and acceptable price range given market conditions in existence at the time of the sale.
CCC's price review compares the particular price with representative prices at a U.S. export position, and is, therefore,
based upon U.S. export weight and grade determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, determining the port value and guaranteed value of the transaction, and CCC's contingent liablility under
the guarantee, on the basis of destination weights and grades would undermine the effectiveness of and could potentially
invalidate, the price review process. CCC recognizes that, in certain markets, the use of destination weights and
grades is a normal commercial term of contract and, therefore, will issue guarantees in connection with such transactions
to facilitate the export trade. However, since CCC is not able to conduct price reviews on the basis of destination
weights and grades (because the determination of destination weights and grades necessarily occurs only after the
commodities have arrived at the port of destination and, therefore, long after the application for GSM&hyph;102/103
coverage has been approved), exporters will have to bear the varied risks involved with contracting on that basis.
Those risks include the possibility that a decrease in weight or grade between export and destination will result
in an adjustment or settlement in favor of the importer; or that an increase will result in an adjustment or settlement
in favor of the exporter. In the former case, the adjustment in favor of the importer would qualify as a ``discount or
allowance'' within the meaning of &sect;1493.20, requiring the exporter to report the occurence so that the guarantee
can be amended to reflect a downward adjustment in CCC's liability made because to do so could invalidate the price
review determination upon which the approval of the guarantee was initially made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents felt that, in the case of cotton, a special exception should be made because of (1) the sensitivity
of cotton to fluctuations in atmospheric conditions resulting in gains or losses in weight; and (2) the long standing
practice of marketing cotton on the basis of landed weights and quality. Changing this practice, to comply with regulations,
will deny the cotton exporters the flexibility to market cotton efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined not to make an exception for destination weights for cotton. At this time there is insufficient
evidence available to CCC that the interim rule has caused any significant problems. As previously noted, when reported
properly to CCC, payment of allowances for destination weights is not a program violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested further clarification of what CCC considers discounts and allowances. Specifically,
they ask whether the definition encompasses carrying charges and normal customer service such as visits to the customer
(to inspect the product, observe its use in the market, etc.), technical assistance, and replacement of faulty or
defective products? The regulation's definition of discounts and allowances includes ``a promise to provide additional
goods, services or benefits in the future.'' Thus, CCC considers an exporter's contractual obligation to provide
technical assistance, or trade servicing, to be, by definition, a discount or allowance to the commodity price on
which CCC price review is based (unless, at the time of price review, the exporter justifies to CCC how such service
or assistance is incorporated into the price, and the price is thus approved by CCC). However, if an exporter does routine
servicing of accounts and customer visits, without any contractual obligation to do so, no discount or allowance
is provided under the definition. CCC has determined not to further modify the definition of discounts and allowances
because there is an infinite variety of circumstances under which exporters could provide a wide range of services
to importers. Exporters are obliged to report instances that may be discounts and allowances, and CCC will make a determination
on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent suggested that: (1) the definition be changed to allow for normal customer services, and (2) the last
phrase be changed to establish a minimum threshold of 2.5 percent of sales value for defining quality, weight and certain
other settlements as discounts or allowances. CCC has determined it is inappropriate to set such a minimum threshold
because it could permit circumvention of the price review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was received regarding the definition of Eligible Interest in &sect;1493.20(g). The commenter felt that
the phrase ``the maximum interest rate stated in the payment guarantee, when determined or adjusted by CCC will not
exceed the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 52-week bill auction in effect at that time'' seems
to imply that CCC is able to adjust the guaranteed interest rate after the payment guarantee is issued. The respondent
requested clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC's maximum liability for interest coverage is indicated in the payment guarantee or any amendments thereof. CCC
can issue payment guarantees at either a fixed rate of interest or at an adjustable rate of interest. In the case of a
fixed interest rate, the rate of CCC's interest coverage is determined as of the date of application for that payment
guarantee and is indicated on the face of the payment guarantee. This maximum eligible interest rate coverage will
not change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On adjustable rate coverage payment guarantees, the method or formula for determining the eligible interest rate
coverage is established for specific time periods. The operative phrase in the definition is ``when determined or
adjusted by CCC.'' For example, currently on GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantees which allow for an adjustment in CCC's
eligible interest coverage, the determination of maximum interest coverage is made on the date of export and adjusted
only on the due dates for principal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that CCC adopt, at the option of the lender, a variable rate of interest coverage. CCC allows
the assignee U.S. financial institution to provide credit to the foreign bank on the basis of a variable rate of interest.
However, under the interim rule and prior regulations, CCC states in the Program Announcement for the applicable
country whether its guarantee coverage will be offered with a fixed or adjustable rate of interest coverage. CCC has
determined that if interest rate coverage were determined at the option of the lender, CCC would not be able to adequately
control its risk exposure. Therefore, it has been determined not to make the suggested change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five respondents commented on the definition of &sect;1493.20(h)(1)(ii), Exported Value, where CCC's payment
guarantee coverage is on the basis of FAS or FOB value on transactions sold on a CFR or CIF basis. All commenters expressed
concern that under this requirement the FAS or FOB coverage will be reduced should the actual freight and/or insurance
increase from what was anticipated at the time of the exporter's application for a payment guarantee. The commenters
noted that the exporter may thus find a portion of the sale amount is uncollectable under the letter of credit because
the financing institution will only pay the exporter the amount recoverable under the payment guarantee, plus the
bank's proportion of shared risk. Other concerns raised were that this requirement is impractical and will cause
problems for all parties because: (1) the actual amount of coverage may not be established until long after the sale
has been made; (2) the values stated in the letter of credit and the import licenses will not reflect the value in final
payment guarantee; and (3) the values in the final payment schedule will not reflect the values in the payment guarantee
nor will they reflect the agreement between the buyers and sellers at the time the contract was made. Commenters stated
that the requirement will reduce use of the programs because exporters may stop selling CFR and instead offer only
on a FOB basis. U.S. exporters could also be hurt if buyers, who previously purchased on a CFR basis, choose to charter
ships for themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The arguments made by the commenters are compelling. CCC's intent in framing the provision of the interim rule was
not to expose exporters, importers or assignees to unmanageable risks. CCC has determined to revise &sect;1493.20(h)(1)(ii)
and &sect;1493.80(a)(7) to return to the practice of using the exporter's valuation of freight and insurance costs
at time of application for a payment guarantee as the basis for determining exported commodity value under the payment
guarantee. CCC recognizes that this change may be viewed as exposing CCC to an added measure of liability in cases where
actual freight costs turn out to be lower than estimated in the exporter's application. However, CCC notes that its
price review procedure confirms that both the overall CFR or CIF price and the implied FOB or FAS commodity price are
within acceptable ranges at the time of application. This ensures against exporters deliberately under-estimating
freight cost at the time of application in order to finance indirectly a significant portion of freight costs in the
commodity financing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that in &sect;1493.20(k), Foreign Bank Letter of Credit, the reference to International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, Publication No. 400 be replaced
with ``latest revision'' to avoid the need for an amendment of the rule when the ICC updates this publication. CCC agrees
to this technical change and has revised &sect;1493.20(k) to reflect the suggestion and the fact that ICC Publication
No. 400 has been revised and issued as ICC Publication No. 500. We have also included the use of the copyright symbol,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0037 unknown -->
, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to reflect the proprietary interest of the ICC in this publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no public comment was received regarding the definition of ``Incoterms'' found at &sect;1493.20(q), CCC
has updated the final rule to reflect the current International Chamber of Commerce's abbreviation for the term ``Cost
and Freight''. Accordingly, CCC uses the abbreviation ``CFR,'' makes such correction to &sect;1493.20(q), and
further acknowledges the alternative abbreviations, ``C&amp;F'' and ``CNF'', because of their continued common
commercial use. Additional language is also added to this definition to indicate CCC's position that contractual
obligations are incurred by the use of these terms by program participants. Additionally, we have again included
the use of the copyright symbol, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

One commenter suggested that the phrase in &sect;1493.20(s), Late Interest, `` *&blank;*&blank;* beginning on
the first day after which the claim for loss is found in good order by CCC *&blank;*&blank;* '' be changed to `` *&blank;*&blank;*
beginning on the first day after receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order *&blank;*&blank;* ''
in order to be consistent with &sect;1493.120(c), Late Interest Payment. CCC has determined that the definition
of ``Late interest'' contained in &sect;1493.20(s) be revised as suggested to avoid inconsistency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning &sect;1493.20(v)(3), Port Value, one commenter felt that when CCC announces CFR or CIF coverage, the
cost of bulk destination bagging should be covered by the credit guarantee, provided that the total cost of ocean freight
for bulk shipment plus all costs of bagging at the destination does not exceed the comparable cost of ocean freight
for bagged cargo. CCC does consider that packaging materials for bulk commodities may be an integral part of the commodity
sale. Hence, on a bulk commodity sale which includes destination bagging, CCC would permit the costs of bags, needles
and twine exported from the U.S. with the commodity to be included in the payment guarantee. Further, CCC will issue
payment guarantees on CFR or CIF sales with destination bagging, if all costs of the bagging at destination are deducted
as provided in &sect;1493.20(h)(3) and &sect;1493.20(v)(3). However, CCC disagrees that CCC should cover the costs
of foreign labor involved in destination bagging in its payment guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment regarding &sect;1493.20(x), Related Obligation, suggested that since draft(s) are not always used, the
wording of the last sentence should be amended to read: ``The U.S. financial institution is entitled to such payments
because it has financed the obligation arising under the letter of credit.'' CCC agrees and has revised the language
of &sect;1493.20(x) accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received regarding the applicant's financial responsibility. The commenter was concerned that
small European companies opening offices in the U.S. in order to take advantage of USDA agricultural programs can
and will make corrupt payments or grant after sales services because their maximum exposure is limited to a small office
and minimal assets. In its experience with participants under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs, CCC finds no grounds
for this concern. Of those few instances of corrupt payments or after sales services that have been identified in CCC
guaranteed transactions (principally in connection with past sales to Iraq), such program violations have been
no more prevalent in transactions entered into by the U.S. offices of small European-based companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter suggested that the determination of financial responsibility should be predicated on an applicant
having a minimum net worth of $5 million, or of an amount relative to GSM business done, such as 10% of estimated annual
business. It is CCC's view that setting minimum net worth requirements would unreasonably and unfairly exclude virtually
all small export companies currently participating in the programs. Small exporters play a significant role, especially
in relation to certain countries and certain commodities, and often where frequent small deliveries are desired
by foreign buyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, CCC's experience with the financial responsibility requirement introduced in the interim rule has been
unsatisfactory. The requirement appears to have little or no value in protecting CCC from financial exposure due
to program violations by an exporter. Nor has this requirement enhanced CCC's ability to recapture financial losses
by pursuing exporters for monetary judgments in the event of a program violation. CCC's potential financial liability
in issuing a payment guarantee is the risk of default from the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit. The rates of
transaction nonperformance and of program violations have been very low. CCC takes any program violation seriously
and pursues administrative actions against exporters shown to have violated the program or other applicable U.S.
laws. However, demonstrating a minimum level of financial assets, or meeting other financial tests, does not materially
enhance CCC's ability to recover losses. Such tests are unreliable and quickly outdated. Therefore, CCC has decided
to delete all references to financial responsibility from &sect;1493.30 and from &sect;1493.30(d)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has revised the scope of the certification statement required by &sect;1493.30(a)(6). This section has required
applicants to certify that ``the applicant; any owner, in whole or in part; or any employee is not currently debarred
or suspended from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government Agency.'' CCC
has determined that this certification requirement should be eased in recognition that large companies, especially
publicly-traded ones with many shareholders, cannot make the certification with absolute knowledge of its truth.
Section 1493.30(a)(6) now requires the following certification: ``I certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
that neither [name of applicant] nor any of its principals has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment
from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government agency. (``Principals,''
for the purpose of this certification, means officers; directors; owners of five percent of or more stock; partners;
and persons having primary management or supervisory responsibility within a business entity (e.g., general manager,
plant manager, head of a subsidiary division, or business segment, and similar positions)). I further agree that,
should any such debarment, suspension, or notice of proposed debarment occur in the future, [name of applicant] will
immediately notify CCC.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with the above change in certification, &sect;1493.30(d), Ineligibility for Program Participation,
has been revised to delete subparagraph (4) which made ineligible any applicant employing any individual who is debarred
or suspended. This change recognizes that some applicants will not be in a position to determine whether or not a single
employee is debarred or suspended.

Section 1493.40 Application for Payment Guarantee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three respondents commented on the description and value of discounts and allowances, &sect;1493.40(a)(10). The
commenters suggested that this requirement is impractical because most discounts and allowances are not known until
the date of export and many times are not quantifiable until the goods have been discharged. One commenter felt that
if the intention of this requirement is to uncover any attempt to obtain coverage, through prior agreement, for an
amount greater than the value of the commodity transaction, a better approach would be to prohibit any discounts or
allowances which are not due to contingencies or acts which are not known at the time of sale. One commenter suggested
that this requirement be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined that to protect the integrity of the program and to limit CCC's contingent liability in the event
of a default, the definition of discounts and allowances contained in &sect;1493.20(f) and the required reporting
thereof under &sect;1493.40(a)(10) and &sect;1493.80(a)(8) is necessary and appropriate. Discounts or allowances
that are unknown by the exporter at the time of application for a payment guarantee, of course, cannot be reported to
CCC at the time of application. However, some discounts and allowances may be provided for in the sales contract. These
discounts and allowances should be reported by the exporter at time of application. If known discounts or allowances
are not reported to CCC at the time of application, CCC cannot adequately price review the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a conditional or contingent discount or allowance is provided for under the terms of the export sales contract,
it should be noted in the application, but not deducted from the port value unless agreed by CCC. This is because the
exporter may not know, at the time, whether the condition(s) will arise and the discount or allowance will be paid.
The exporter should report the value of the discount or allowance, if it has been paid, at the time of filing the evidence
of export report. If a payment of a discount or allowance occurs after the submission of an evidence of export report,
the exporter must report the value of the discount or allowance in an amended evidence of export report, and should
notify the U.S. assignee, if any (see previous discussion of this point concerning the definition of ``discounts
and allowance,'' &sect;1493.20(f)). In the event of a claim under the payment guarantee, CCC may hold an exporter
liable for value of the unreported discounts and allowances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(14) has been revised in this final rule for the purpose of clarity. Applicants often were unable
to report the address of the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit. The language of this subsection has been changed
to now state ``the address or location'' of the foreign bank. CCC has determined this change will still provide sufficient
information to identify the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(15) has been revised in this final rule to delete the requirement to include the estimated principal
payment due dates and amounts due. CCC is able to make this calculation using other information reported under this
subsection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(16) has been revised in this final rule to add the number of the Export Enhancement Program, Dairy
Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program Agreement
assigned by USDA, as applicable. This added information is not a burdensome requirement for the exporter and assists
CCC in tracking concurrent use of credit and subsidy programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received regarding USDA's price review process established under &sect;1493.40(b). The commenter
questioned how USDA can properly determine a fair market price. The respondent felt that U.S. companies will lose
the incentive to be innovative and aggressive in creating markets for their products if the USDA controls prices.
This commenter felt that while high prices may indicate kickbacks or other improprieties and warrant a complete investigation,
the practice of price review should be used as a tool to monitor the program, and should not constitute ``price approval.''
The commenter recommended that the practice of price review should be eliminated from the regulations. CCC disagrees.
The price review procedure under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs is not a ``price approval'' mechanism. Although
CCC does have the right to reject applications for a payment guarantee that, in CCC's opinion, do not reflect market
parameters, in practice, when a sales price raises questions, the exporter is given the opportunity to explain the
factors relating to the price. Often, after receiving such information, CCC has been able to approve the application.
CCC's intention is not to control the price that an exporter may negotiate with an importer. However, CCC does have
an obligation to review those sales prices which appear excessively high or low because they may be linked to possible
program violations, such as kickbacks, extra sales services or the inclusion of lower value foreign content in the
shipment. Therefore, the current practice of price review for GSM&hyph;102/103 program applications will continue.

One commenter questioned whether CCC considered normal customer service, e.g., visits to the customer to inspect
the product, to observe its use in the market, to provide technical assistance, or to replace faulty or defective products
to be extra sales services under &sect;1493.50(b). The respondent requested that CCC clarify and give examples or
guidelines of what is considered to be extra sales services. CCC cautions exporters that any extension of extra sales
services provided to an importer that can be directly linked to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee
may be construed as a discount or allowance which, although permissible, must be reported and deducted from the value
of the guarantee. On the other hand, an extra sales service not linked to the basic commercial intent of the transaction
(i.e., that is extraneous to the transaction) is prohibited. The instance, type, nature, and the extent of linkage
to the sales transaction must be examined on a case-by-case basis. As previously discussed in relation to comments
received concerning the definition of ``Discounts and Allowances,'' &sect;1493.20(f), CCC will review the specific
circumstances when they are reported. Therefore, CCC has determined not to provide specific examples of extra sales
services_extraneous and otherwise_in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents made comments regarding &sect;1493.50(a), which requires the exporter to certify that the agricultural
commodity or product exported under the payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity or product as defined
by &sect;1493.20(z). While both commenters fundamentally agree with the U.S. origin requirement, they felt that
because of the changes in the U.S. market environment, particularly the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, a rigid
interpretation of the U.S. origin requirement will interfere with the normal operation of the U.S. grain marketing
system. The commenters suggested that an alternative to the U.S. origin requirement might be a ``transit billing''
system similar to the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service's current policy for all commodity purchases,
except dairy products. Under transit billing, in the commenter's opinion, domestic origin requirements should
be satisfied if a grain handling facility containing commingled domestic and foreign origin commodities, has quantities
of domestic origin commodities equal to or greater than the quantity called for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has reviewed the ``transit billing'' system and has determined that such a system will not meet the statutory requirements
of the 1990 Act because the definition of a U.S. agricultural commodity contained in Section 102(7) of the Act requires
that an agricultural commodity exported under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs be ``entirely produced in the United
States.'' Transit billing would permit unlimited commingling of U.S. and imported grains with rules that would maximize
the likelihood that a warehouseman would always have a sufficient theoretical U.S.-origin stock position to be able
to fill export orders for U.S. grain. It would be a formula accounting system which would be unrelated to the actual
identity of the grain being handled. Therefore, it has been determined that transit billing would not meet the statutory
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative proposed by one of the commenters is for CCC to allow foreign agricultural components to be exported
but to provide no guarantee coverage on the value of any such components. The commenter proposed this option in reference
to bulk grains, an agricultural commodity, not a product of an agricultural commodity. As previously noted, Section
102(7) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act does not, in CCC's view, permit any foreign content
to be included in the U.S. agricultural commodity exported under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent asked if under &sect;1493.60(b), Period of Guarantee Coverage, the language ``the payment guarantee
will apply to the period beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or on the date when interest begins to accrue,
whichever is earlier,'' implies that CCC will guarantee credits on which interest accrues prior to disbursement
of funds to the U.S. exporter. The answer is yes. CCC will provide a payment guarantee that includes interest coverage
which begins before the date of export from the U.S. in circumstances where the exporter has sold the commodity at an
U.S. interior point of loading of the export carrier (e.g., railcar or truck for export to Mexico). However, interest
coverage begins no earlier than the date interest begins to accrue under the guaranteed credit. This date could be
earlier than the date of disbursement of funds to the U.S. exporter if this was provided for in the foreign bank's letter
of credit or related obligation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received suggesting changes in &sect;1493.60(e), Reserve Coverage for Loading Tolerances. Three
respondents believed the purpose of this provision is to allow the exporter to pay the guarantee fee only on the actual
amount of the coverage required, and recommended that the section be changed to allow the exporter to apply for a payment
guarantee (and pay the guarantee fee) based on any quantity, within the sales contract specifications, reserving
coverage up to the maximum contract tolerance. One of the commentors also felt that, as a result of the requirement
in the interim rule, exporters would pay excessive fees for coverage not used and credit availability would be encumbered
without product exported. CCC agrees with these comments and has revised the language of &sect;1493.60(e) to permit
exporters to apply for guarantee coverage, and pay the guarantee fee, on the basis of any quantity within the upper
and lower tolerance and to reserve coverage up to the upper tolerance. After export, when coverage has been reserved,
the exporter will be permitted to amend the payment guarantee and pay an additional fee based upon the difference between
the original payment guarantee quantity and the actual quantity exported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received regarding &sect;1493.60(i), Amendments. One commenter, a financial institution, felt
that a request for an amendment of the payment guarantee should not be restricted to the exporter, and that the assignee
should also be able to submit a request for an amendment. CCC disagrees. To do so would place CCC in the position of unilaterally
agreeing to amend, and possibly breach, a contractual agreement with exporters at the request of a third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment received on &sect;1493.60(i) concerned interpretation of the phrase `` *&blank;*&blank;* any
amendment to the payment guarantee may result in an increase of the guarantee fee.'' The commenter felt if it is the
intention of CCC to assess fees for amendments, which are not always within the exporter's control, then this language
should be deleted. It is not CCC's intention to assess additional fees for all amendments. In response to the comment,
the language of &sect;1493.60(i) has been clarified to provide the possibility that CCC may charge a fee for a requested
amendment when, as a consequence of the request, CCC may incur additional liability.

Several comments were received on this section. A general comment was made regarding the proprietary nature of the
information submitted by the exporter. The commenter felt that any information submitted should be deemed confidential
and access restricted; neither foreign buyers nor competitors should have access. CCC has not included in the Interim
Rule or Final Rule provisions on the protection of participant information because this matter is governed by the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act. Moreover, section 402(a)(3) of the Agricultural Trade Act
of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act (7 U.S.C. 5662(a)(3)) provides that ``the personally identifiable information
contained in reports under subsection (a) [records of the exporter] may be withheld in accordance with section 552(b)(4)
of title 5, United States Code.'' This section further provides that ``any officer or employee of the Department of
Agriculture who knowingly discloses confidential information as defined by section 1905 of Title 18, United States
Code, shall be subject to section 1905 of Title 18, United States Code. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
to authorize the withholding of information from Congress.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three respondents requested that &sect;1493.80(a), Report of Export, be amended to allow 60 days for submitting
evidence of export reports for truck or rail export shipments because it is difficult to obtain the required entry
certificate into Mexico within the 30&hyph;day filing period. CCC recognizes that experience validates this comment.
In the past it has often been necessary for the exporter to obtain an amendment to the payment guarantee allowing an
extension of the time period for filing the evidence of export report. In a study of this problem, CCC determined that
an extension of the filing time limit from 30 days to 60 days for truck and rail exports would decrease the number of this
type of amendment request by approximately one-half. Accordingly, in this final rule &sect;1493.80(a) has been
simplified and &sect;1493.80(b) revised to provide a time limit of 60&hyph;days for filing evidence of export reports
for truck and rail exports. With this revision, &sect;1493.80(b) continues to provide for the filing of evidence
of export reports for shipments by other types of carriers within a 30 day time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, for the sake of simplicity and expediency, CCC has deleted the requirement previously contained in &sect;1493.80(a)(9)
of the interim rule requiring the exporter or its assignee to report a final payment schedule showing the payment dates
and the amounts separately for both principal and interest. CCC now has computer capability to calculate this information
from the other information submitted in the evidence of export report and the terms of the payment guarantee. The requirement
for the payment schedule information has often been a hindrance to the timely filing of complete evidence of export
reports because exporters routinely must have their assignee submit this information. It is expected that this change
will expedite filings of evidence of export reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested clarification regarding &sect;1493.80(b), Time Limit for Submission of Evidence of Export.
This sub-part allows for an extension of the time limit if it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC (but not
if payments by the foreign bank are past due under the payment guarantee). The commenters would like to see clarification
of CCC's policies once a defaulting foreign bank is again current with its account. It was suggested that a sentence
be added stating that CCC will reconsider the payment guarantee status once the foreign bank resumes payments and
becomes current in its obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined to address this comment by revising the language of &sect;1493.80(b) to indicate that if the report
required by paragraph (a) of &sect;1493.80 is not received by the time limit specified, the payment guarantee will
become null and void, but only if failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in: (1) significant
financial harm to CCC; (2) the undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program; (3) obstruction of the
fair administration of the program; or (4) a threat to the integrity of the program. Section 1493.80(b) will still
permit CCC to extend the time limit for filing of evidence of export reports if such extension is determined by the General
Sales Manager to be in the best interests of CCC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents commented on &sect;1493.90(c), which requires the exporter to certify that the exporter or exporter's
assignee has, and will retain, documents evidencing the obligation of the foreign bank for five years after the final
installment due date. Both commenters said that the exporter can make the certification for themselves, but that
they have no legal recourse at their disposal, to require the third parties to comply with this provision. The commenters
recommended that the certification be deleted. CCC has considered the comments made and agrees that the certification
can be deleted because the exporter or the exporter's assignee is already bound by &sect;1493.140(e)(1) to retain
documentation evidencing the obligation of the foreign bank for a period of five years after the final installment
date. This document retention requirement is further strengthened because evidence of the foreign bank related
obligation is necessary to submit a claim to CCC under the payment guarantee. Therefore, a certification that such
records are being maintained has little practical value. CCC has determined to delete the certification previously
found at &sect;1493.90(c) of the interim rule from this final rule.

Section 1493.100 Proof of Entry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comment received on &sect;1493.100(a), Diversion, pointed out that while the exporter may contractually preclude
diversion of an FOB shipment, the exporter has no control over the importer's vessel; unless the exporter knowingly
abetted the diversion, there should be no implication of potential exporter liability to CCC under such circumstances.
Under &sect;1493.130(d) of the interim rule, ``the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amount paid under a payment
guarantee when it is determined by CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in breach of any contractual
obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter *&blank;*&blank;*'' Further, the exporter's assignee
may be held liable to CCC under the same standard. However, &sect;1493.130(e), Good Faith, provides that a violation
by an exporter of the certifications, particularly &sect;1493.100 (Proof of Entry), will not affect the validity
of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee who had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the
time the exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC recognizes the burden placed on exporters with FOB sales in ensuring compliance with program requirements concerning
diversion. However, in view of the legislative mandate imposed on CCC to ensure arrival of program shipments in destination
countries (Title IV, Subtitle A, Section 401 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act), and
in view of the fact that CCC has a contractual relationship only with the exporter, not with the importer, CCC sees no
feasible alternative to the present policy of holding exporters responsible for maintaining proof of entry documentation
as a means of preventing diversion. This policy makes it in the interest of exporters to make every effort to obtain
binding commitments from foreign buyers to provide such documentation on FOB/FAS sales and not to divert shipments.
The strength of evidence of such efforts by exporters would undoubtedly be of material interest in any situation where
CCC suffered a financial loss on a payment guarantee and found that diversion had taken place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents commented on &sect;1493.100(b), Proof of Entry. One commenter was unsure what is intended by this
section. Both commenters felt that the only reliable means of obtaining proof of entry is for the exporter to retain
a private surveyor at each location. They felt that this was an unnecessary cost and burden to the exporter and that
there is little justification for this requirement. Clarification of the section was requested. In adding the requirement
for proof of entry in the interim rule, CCC employed the basic requirements for proof of entry documents that are used
for the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). Although a surveyor's report would be an acceptable means of meeting this
requirement, CCC disagrees that it is the only reliable means of obtaining proof of entry. Many countries have provided
such documentation with respect to the EEP program. Further, in the event that traditional forms of entry documentation
are unobtainable, &sect;1493.100(b) permits CCC to consider other types of documents, which can be deemed acceptable
by the GSM. Finally, as stated in the interim rule, the requirement for proof of entry documentation on GSM&hyph;102/103
transactions is mandated by the 1990 Act. Therefore, CCC has determined that no further clarification or change is
necessary to &sect;1493.100.

Section 1493.110 Notice of Default and Claims for Loss
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that CCC adopt a ``Payment Certificate'' concept (currently incorporated in programs of
the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank)) under which one claim is submitted covering the payment of
the balance of the guarantee. In follow-up discussions with CCC, the commenter explained the ``Payment Certificate''
concept as being a mechanism where CCC would pre-approve documents that are normally submitted in the claim procedure
and issue a payment certificate which, when submitted at the time of claim, would be evidence that CCC would pay the
claim at a certain time interval after receipt of the payment certificate, notice of default, and subrogation agreement.
CCC has determined that, at this time, it cannot adopt such a measure because it has insufficient resources to review
and pre-approve all documents required for submission when filing a claim. One major difference between Eximbank
and CCC export credit guarantee programs is the sheer number of payment guarantees that CCC issues during a program
year, over 3,000 payment guarantees annually. Eximbank's guarantees are generally much larger in value and fewer
in number. It would not be administratively feasible for CCC to review documentation in advance of issuance of all
of its guarantees. CCC will continue to explore the possibility of adapting the ``payment certificate'' concept
to permit, for certain countries or particular foreign banks, a mechanism that would address the ``time certain for
payment of claims'' element necessary to facilitate securitization of CCC payment guarantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It should be recognized, however, that under existing CCC policy, only one claim need be filed (in the sense of providing
full documentation relating to the transaction). Thereafter, only certified notices of failure to receive scheduled
installments, reference to the original claim, and corresponding subrogation agreement need be submitted to CCC.
Accordingly, CCC agrees that &sect;1493.110 should be clarified to reflect this fact and has added a new paragraph
&sect;1493.110(c) to make this policy clearer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the reference to ``drafts drawn'' in &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(i)(B)(1), be revised to read
``obligations financed,'' since drafts are not always used as financial obligations. CCC agrees and has adopted
this clearer language in the subsection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned why, under Filing a Claim for Loss, &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(v), CCC requires a copy of the
previously submitted report of export to accompany the claim for loss. CCC requires this in order to accelerate the
claims payment process. CCC considers this a reasonable requirement and therefore, has determined that the requirement
of &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(v) remain unchanged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a financial institution, made a comment pertaining to &sect;1493.120(a), Determination of CCC's
Liability, which states that CCC, upon receipt in ``good order'' of the information and documents under &sect;1493.110(b),
Filing a Claim for Loss, will determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable. The commenter states
that in order for securities to be viewed as ``government credit,'' there can be no risk that the payment under the guarantee
would not be made. The commenter also argued that, due to the extensive list of documents and information required
and the subjective judgement that such documents and information be in ``good order,'' a risk of non-payment by CCC
exists. The recommendation is to require that most documents and information be approved (or alternatively, that
the proper forms be pre-agreed by CCC) prior to issuance of the guarantee. This recommendation would eliminate the
subjective nature of ``good order'' and would eliminate the non-payment risk. This issue has already been addressed
under General Comments (securitization) and in relation to &sect;1493.110. Again, although CCC is not now making
changes to specifically address this concern, CCC will continue to look at possibilities to adapt mechanisms suitable
to CCC programs to facilitate securitization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received on &sect;1493.120(c), Late Interest Payment. One respondent (a Federal agency) said
that the late interest is short-term interest and that the rate factor should be based on the ``91-day Treasury bill
rate, not to exceed the 52-week bill rate.'' CCC agrees with the comment that it is more suitable to use a short-term
interest instrument for late interest. Accordingly, CCC has changed &sect;1493.120(c) to provide that late interest
is based on the 91-day Treasury bill. Similarly, changes have been made to &sect;1493.130(b)(1) and (2) to also reflect
the use of a short-term interest instrument as the benchmark for ``late interest'' to be paid both on monies owed to
CCC in a recovery, and on monies recovered by CCC and owed to an exporter or an exporter's assignee under pro rata sharing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other comment pertained to the securitization of payment guarantees. The commenter suggested that &sect;1493.120(c)
establish CCC's obligation to pay a claim within a specified time period. The commentor stated that this was necessary
because a risk of nonpayment or late payment by CCC would be unacceptable to rating agencies reviewing securitization
proposals which include CCC payment guarantees. CCC has determined not to adopt this suggested change for reasons
previously stated in relation to general comments on the interim rule and specifically on &sect;1493.20(s) and &sect;1493.110.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that &sect;1493.120(d), Accelerated Payments, be changed to allow payments to be made on
an accelerated basis at the option of the lender. CCC's policy is to not pay claims for losses in advance of a default
unless it can be determined to be in CCC's best interest to do so. If CCC were to revise &sect;1493.120(d) to allow an
accelerated payment mechanism at the option of the lender, CCC could be required to disburse funds to banks for installment
defaults which have not yet occurred. CCC has determined that this obligation would not be in its best interest, and
that &sect;1493.120(d) will not be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent expressed concern that under &sect;1493.120(e)(1), Action Against the Assignee, failure of the
exporter to comply with the requirement to file an amended report of export to reflect post-export adjustments might
jeopardize the assignee's claim. CCC acknowledges the legitimacy of the commenter's concerns. Section 1493.120(e)
does not specify as to what actions CCC may take against the assignee for the failure of the exporter to file amended
evidence of export reports if, for example, later discounts or allowances are granted to the importer by the exporter.
Section 1493.120(e) states that `` *&blank;*&blank;* CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take any action
or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, omission or statement by the exporter over which the assignee
has no knowledge, provided that: (1) the exporter complies with the reporting requirements under &sect;1493.80
and &sect;1493.90; and (2) the exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements and documents specified
in &sect;1493.110.'' In a post-export adjustment (i.e., a previously unreported discount or allowance) the assignee
would, most probably, have no knowledge of the exporter's action (consideration given to the importer) and omission
(not filing a corrected evidence of export report). CCC has clarified &sect;1493.120(e) to indicate that assignees
will not be held liable for failure of the exporter to submit to CCC any corrections or amendments to evidence of export
reports.

One comment was received on &sect;1493.130(b)(1), Receipt of Monies. The commenter suggested eliminating CCC's
requirement that all monies received by the lender from any source whatsoever after the payment by CCC of a claim be
paid to CCC. CCC has addressed this issue under General Comment regarding securitization proposals. CCC has determined
not to make this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents requested changes in the wording of &sect;1493.130(d), Liabilities to CCC, to take into account
that a technical breach by the exporter may be inconsequential, and that the breach may not have been the cause for any
payment made by CCC under the payment guarantee. The suggested rewording of this phrase is `` *&blank;*&blank;* or
has been or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter for
the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee or in fulfilling an obligation under GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103
and such amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee resulted from such fraud or material breach by the exporter.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received regarding the restrictions of &sect;1493.140(a), Assignment. The commenters felt that
financial institutions should be able to place assets they originate into the world capitol markets and that CCC should
facilitate this goal by permitting more than one assignment of the payment guarantee. One commenter, a financial
institution, suggested that CCC allow the financial institution to extend the credit and assign such credit to a grantor
trust or special purpose corporation, such as a Funding Vehicle, established by the financial institution, or let
the Funding Vehicle itself take assignment and extend the credit. The same commenter also recommended that the language
in &sect;1493.11(a) of the previous regulations be included in this section. The previous regulation stated that
``The assignment shall cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already paid and shall not be made
to more than one party, and shall not be subject to further assignment, unless approved in advance by CCC. Any such assignment
may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating in the financing.'' In &sect;1493.140(a)
of the interim rule, CCC deletes the final sentence of the previous &sect;1493.11(a). However, by deleting this language
from the interim rule, CCC did not intend to preclude its consideration of assignments of guarantees to various types
of financial institutions. CCC will consider acknowledging assignments that facilitate securitization of guarantees
and that are consistent with other program requirments. Therefore, although CCC has not restored the particular
sentence in this final rule, &sect;1493.140(a) has been modified to clarify CCC's policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents requested that &sect;1493.140(a)(3) be modified so that when CCC determines a financial institution
to be ineligible to receive an assignment of a payment guarantee, CCC will notify both the exporter and the financial
institution. CCC concurs with this suggestion and has adopted such provision in &sect;1493.140(a)(3) of this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third respondent felt that &sect;1493.140(a)(3) could create difficulties for financial institutions because
the notice of ineligibility would reach them after they had extended credit. The commenter suggested that CCC notify
a financial institution of its ineligibility before the institution extends credit under an anticipated CCC guarantee.
CCC disagrees. CCC does not have the resources to continually monitor the thousands of U.S. financial institutions
which are potentially eligible to receive assignments and to notify those that would be ineligible if they were to
be assigned a CCC payment guarantee. Further, &sect;1493.140(b), Ineligibility of Financial Institutions to Receive
an Assignment, explains the conditions under which an assignment to a financial institution would not be acknowledged
by CCC. If a U.S. financial institution has reason to believe that it might not be eligible under this section of the
regulations, it may contact the Treasurer, CCC to review its situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the provisions in &sect;1493.140(e)(1), Maintenance of Records and Access to
Premises, place unreasonable burdens on the parties involved in the transaction. One commenter, a financial institution,
was concerned that the blanket requirement of access to records pertaining to transactions conducted outside the
program may interfere with bank confidentiality. Although CCC understands this concern, section 402(a)(3) of the
Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act, provides that officers or employees of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture are subject to criminal penalties for knowingly disclosing confidential information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter felt that the records pertaining to transactions outside the program should be subject to review
only if they are directly related to transactions made under the program, and that the General Sales Manager's opinion
should not determine whether the outside transaction(s) pertain to program transactions. This commenter recommended
that the regulation apply to outside transactions which ``relate directly'' rather than that ``pertain'' to the
program transaction. CCC disagrees and has determined that the language of &sect;1493.140(e)(1) should remain
unchanged. On a case-by-case basis, and as determined by the GSM, CCC may need to examine records not directly related
to the GSM&hyph;102/103 transaction in order to determine whether a program violation has occurred (e.g., inventory
records may be examined to determine whether foreign content exists in export shipment under the program). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters said that they can request agents, intervening purchasers, and related companies to make available
documents or information requested by CCC, but cannot guarantee access to third party records, particularly those
held by companies or persons located outside the U.S. This is particularly the case with documents which may be generated
by agents of the exporter, or by companies with special arrangements with the exporter which are foreign entities.
Because access to such records may be critical to CCC's efforts to monitor programs and to ensure their integrity,
CCC expects that the exporter will use its contractual and other means of influence to obtain those pertinent records
of the outside parties involved. CCC recognizes that exporters may only be able to obtain from such third parties copies
of those records that pertain to the GSM&hyph;102/103 export transaction in question. The final rule does not require
that the exporter retain all records of such third parties, nor those records pertaining to transactions conducted
outside the program. Further, the final rule does not require that an agent of the exporter, an intervening purchaser,
or parties with a special arrangement with the exporter must make available such records and grant access to their
premises. CCC would expect the exporter to be able to provide copies of any and all records relating to the transaction
held by these entities if so requested by government officials authorized to conduct program reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments recommended that &sect;1493.140(g), Submission of Documents by Principal Officers, be expanded to
permit an authorized full time employee of the exporter to sign all required submissions. CCC agrees with the comment.
On August 7, 1991, CCC issued a Notice to Program Participants which clarified the signatory requirements for submissions
to CCC. The policy reflected in this Notice to Participants has been included in &sect;1493.140(g) of this final rule
to permit principal officers or their designees to sign required submissions to CCC. However, the August 7, 1991 Notice
is not being superseded because it also applies to other export programs and contains examples of how such authorizations
by principals to their designees might be worded.

Overview
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing the operations of the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;102)
and the Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;103). The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs of the
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by making available export
credit guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing of foreign purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities
on credit terms. Under GSM&hyph;102, credit guarantees are issued for terms of up to three years. Under GSM&hyph;103,
credit guarantees are issued for terms of from three to ten years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market
and where private U.S. financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee.
The programs are operated in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs are targeted
toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have sufficient
financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this credit guarantee
facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market
development for U.S. agricultural commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The credit facility created by these programs is the CCC payment guarantee. The payment guarantee is an agreement
by CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of the exporter's right to proceeds,
specified amounts of principal and interest due from, but not paid by, the foreign bank issuing an irrevocable letter
of credit in connection with the export sale to which CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, rather than governmental, financing and incurs
a substantial portion of the risk of default by the foreign bank. CCC assumes this risk, in order to be able to operate
the programs for the purposes specified in &sect;1493.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Credit facility mechanism
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Typically, in export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities, payment by the importer is made under an irrevocable
letter of credit. For the purpose of the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs, CCC will consider applications
for payment guarantees only in connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for
the agricultural commodities will be made in one of the two following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of the exporter, specifically stating the deferred
payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as such payments become due;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of the exporter, that is supported by a related obligation
specifically stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payment to the exporter,
or the exporter's assignee, in U.S. dollars as such payments become due. The exporter may assign the right to proceeds
under the letter of credit or related obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the exporter
may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred payment date(s) as set forth in the irrevocable foreign bank
letter of credit or its related obligation. The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs are designed to protect the
exporter or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults,
whether for commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the foreign bank obligated under the letter of credit or related
obligation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program administration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs will be administered pursuant to this part and any Program Announcements
and Notices to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent with, this part. These programs are under
the general administrative responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS/USDA).
The review and payment of claims for loss will be administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular
USDA or CCC offices, will be announced by a public press release (see &sect;1493.20(c), ``Contacts P/R'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Country allocations and program announcements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a GSM&hyph;102 and/or GSM&hyph;103 program
allocation for a specific country. The Program Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific allocations
for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof. Exporters may negotiate export sales to buyers in that country
for one of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement and seek payment guarantee coverage within the dollar
amounts of specified coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a requirement that the exporter's
sales contract contain a shipping deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for a contractual shipping
deadline will be stated in the Program Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified ``undesignated''
or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion of the total country
allocation may then be designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include an ``allocated''
or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain further information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated''
portion of the country allocation.

the application is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been or will
be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to applications

the statement set forth in &sect;1493.40(a)(18), certifies that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the payment guarantee is a United States agricultural
commodity or a product thereof, as defined in &sect;1493.20(z);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the

requirements of &sect;1493.30, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances
which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications
with respect to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed

that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified
in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of application and CCC
determines to make such reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a quantity
greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid (i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional
coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee,
and by paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is not filed with
CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not
to reserve the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.

any applicable Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may include, but will not be limited
to, a change in the credit period and an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly
those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee
fee. (Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be submitted by the exporter or the exporter's
assignee are not viewed as amendments.)

export was by rail or truck; or 30 calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period for filing a report
of export will commence upon each date of export of the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence
of export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, the payment guarantee will become null and
void only if and only to the extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Significant financial harm to CCC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By providing the statement contained in &sect;1493.80(a)(10), the exporter is certifying that the information
provided in the evidence of export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this
section have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with
regard to reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with
respect to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed
against the exporter. The exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth in
&sect;1493.80(a)(10), certifies that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under a payment guarantee is a United States agricultural commodity
or a product thereof, as defined in &sect;1493.20(z);

(b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity called for in the exporter's sales contract with
the importer have been exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A letter of credit has been opened in favor of the exporter by the foreign bank shown in the payment guarantee to cover
the port value of the commodity exported; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the
transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies
with applicable United States law; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The information provided pursuant to &sect;1493.30 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification
requirements of &sect;1493.30 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances
which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements.

. Upon receipt in good order of the information and documents required under &sect;1493.110, CCC will determine whether
or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable
supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC determines that it is liable to the exporter

(1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus eligible interest; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee beginning with the first day after the day of reciept
of a claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. Late
interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will
be calculated based on the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by
the Department of Treasury as of the due date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accelerated payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. CCC will pay claims only for losses on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due under an
accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed
by the foreign bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the foreign bank's letter of credit
issued in favor of the exporter, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from
CCC.

Notification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights under
the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.

Receipt of monies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from
the importer, the foreign bank, or any other source whatsoever, such monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer,
CCC. If such monies are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the exporter or the exporter's
assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt
by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and will accrue from such
date to the date of payment by the exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be charged only on CCC's
share of the recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will
pay the holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided that the required information necessary
for determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 business days from
the date of recovery or 15 business days from receiving the required information for determining pro rata distribution,
whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury
91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and such interest
will accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the recovery payable
to the holder of the payment guarantee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allocation of recoveries
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Recoveries made by CCC from the importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the
exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee
and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest
of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default.
Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC prorates any
collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both
CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. Appendix A to &sect;1493.130_Illustration of Pro
Rata Allocation of Recoveries_provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).

Liabilities to CCC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Notwithstanding any other terms of the payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by
CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been
or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter for the purpose
of obtaining the payment guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103. Further,
the exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is
determined by CCC that the exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program requirements.

exporter to comply with the provisions of &sect;1493.100 or &sect;1493.140(e) will not affect the validity of any
payment guarantee with respect to an assignee which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the time
such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in &sect;1493.130(c), regarding pro rata sharing of
recoveries made for claims filed under the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs. A typical case might be as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit arrangement with the foreign bank calling for equal annual
payments of principal and annual payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum and a penalty interest rate of
12 percent per annum on overdue amounts until the overdue amount is paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of $100,000 and an interest payment of $10,000, both due
on January 31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a claim in good order with CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 98 percent of the principal amount due ($98,000)
and interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 98 percent of the principal ($7,840).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The latest bond equivalent rate of the 52-week Treasury bill auction average which has been published by the Department
of Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment (January 31) is 9 percent. The latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury
Bill auction average which has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment by CCC
(February 11) is 7 percent.

In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of losses, the total amount due under the foreign
bank obligation would be determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using the above example in
which the amount owed by the foreign bank is $110,000, CCC would be entitled to 95.75 percent ($106,063.07 divided
by $110,765.62) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be entitled to 4.21 percent ($4,668.55 divided by $110,795.62)
of any recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this example, the losses were recovered after the
claim has been paid by CCC, &sect;1493.130(b) would apply.

Assignment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right
to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the
payment guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless approved in advance by
CCC, be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Subject to further assignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the
assignee with the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing
by an officer of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive an assignment,
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC will provide notice thereof, to the financial institution and
to the exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the written notice of assignment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an assignment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a
payment guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the financial institution issuing the letter of credit;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable under a payment guarantee approved by CCC
if such financial institution:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer
of CCC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the financial institution issuing the letter of credit;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. CCC may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under the payment guarantee has been
assigned, with the agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the
satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines
that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising
out of any transaction covered by the payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's
obligation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) For a period of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment guarantee, the exporter or the
exporter's assignee, as applicable, must maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and deliveries
of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities exported in connection with a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103
payment guarantee, including those records generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and related
companies involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller
General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access to
the premises of the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the effective
date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies
of the exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's or related company's books, records
and accounts concerning transactions relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial
records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both
normal and unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee may be required to make available
to the Secretary of Agriculture or the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives,
records that pertain to transactions conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would
pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in connection with the payment guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by &sect;1493.100(b), and must provide access to such documentation
if requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the five-year period specified
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is the responsibility of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves with, all regulations,
Program Announcements, and Notices to Participants relating to the GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 program, as applicable.
Applicants for payment guarantees under these programs are hereby on notice that they will be bound by any terms contained
in applicable Program Announcements or Notices to Participants issued prior to the date of approval of a payment guarantee.

Submission of documents by principal officers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All required submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or requests (i.e., requests for
amendments), by exporters or exporters' assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of the
exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In cases where the designee is acting on behalf
of the principal or the officer, the signature must be accompanied by: wording indicating the delegation of authority
or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized
person or officer. Further, the exporter or exporter's assignee must ensure that all information/reports required
under these regulations are submitted within the required time limits. If requested in writing, CCC will acknowledge
receipt of a submission by the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment of receipt is requested, the
exporter or exporter's assignee must submit an extra copy of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope
for return by U.S. mail. If courier services are desired for the return receipt, the exporter or exporter's assignee
must also submit a self-addressed courier service order which includes the recipient's billing code for such service.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to require power reactor licensees to: Assure that uncontrolled changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in reactivity, reactor coolant inventory, and loss of subcooled state in the reactor coolant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system when subcooled conditions are normally being maintained, will not occur when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plant is in either a shutdown or low power condition; assure that containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity is maintained or can be reestablished in a timely manner as needed to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
releases in excess of the current limits in the regulations when the plant is in either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shutdown or low power condition; establish controls in technical specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements or plant procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by technical specifications administrative controls for equipment which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee identifies as necessary to perform their safety function when the plant is in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shutdown or low power condition; evaluate realistically the effect of fires stemming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from activities conducted during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether such fires could realistically prevent accomplishment of the normal decay heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal capability, and if so, either provide measures to prevent loss of normal decay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat removal or establish a contingency plan that would ensure that an alternate decay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat removal capability exists; and for licensees of PWRs only, provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation for monitoring water level in the RCS during midloop operation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments would provide substantial additional protection to public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety from the risk of a core-melt accident.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past several years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become increasingly concerned about the safety of operations during the shutdown of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power reactors. The loss of decay heat removal (DHR) during shutdown and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling has been a continuing problem. In 1980, DHR was lost at the Davis-Besse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant when one residual heat removal (RHR) pump failed and the second pump was out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of service. After reviewing the Davis-Besse event and studying the operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that existed at the time of the event, the NRC issued Bulletin 80&hyph;42 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generic Letter (GL) 80&hyph;43 calling for new technical specifications to ensure that one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RHR system is operating and a second is available (i.e., operable) for most shutdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The Diablo Canyon event of April 10, 1987, highlighted the fact that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
midloop operation was a particularly sensitive condition with respect to operability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual heat removal pumps. In this event, the reactor coolant system was overdrained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during midloop operation. The resulting low water level in the reactor vessel caused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vortexing and air entrainment and loss of both residual heat removal pumps. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the event, the staff issued GL 88&hyph;17, recommending that licensees address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous generic deficiencies to improve the reliability of the DHR capability. More 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recently, the incident investigation team's report on the loss of AC power at the Vogtle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant (NUREG&hyph;1410) emphasized the need for risk management of shutdown operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, discussions with foreign regulatory organizations (i.e., French and Swedish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities) about their evaluations regarding shutdown risk have reinforced previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC staff findings that the core-damage probability (CDP) for shutdown operation can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a fairly substantial fraction of the total CDP. Because of these concerns regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational safety during shutdown, the NRC conducted a careful, detailed evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety during shutdown and low-power operations which is documented in NUREG&hyph;1449. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff's comprehensive evaluation of shutdown and low-power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations, documented in NUREG&hyph;1449, included observations and inspections at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of plants, analysis of operating experience, deterministic safety analysis, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insights from probabilistic risk assessments. It was observed that shutdown risks have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reduced at many plants through improvements to outage programs. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements have been unevenly and inconsistently applied across the industry. From 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this evaluation, the NRC has concluded that public health and safety have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately protected during the period that plants have been in shutdown and low power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions; but that substantial safety improvements are possible and NRC requirements are warranted for the following
reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A regulatory requirement would set minimum standards for all plants and would ensure that safety improvements
already made by industry will be applied consistently throughout the industry and will not be eroded in the future.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A regulatory requirement would further reduce risk by improving safety in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of fire protection for all plants and midloop operation for PWRs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Significant precursor events involving loss of DHR capability continue to occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
despite efforts to resolve the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Some controls, including regulatory controls, have been significantly lacking and have in the past allowed plants
to enter circumstances that would likely challenge safety functions with minimal mitigation equipment available
and containment integrity not established.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has identified possible regulatory actions to address these problems and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjected them to a regulatory analysis which also addresses the requirements for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backfit analysis under 10 CFR 50.109.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 These actions have been evaluated within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
framework of the Commission's Safety Goal Policy, (51 FR 30028; August 21, 1986) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether or not they would result in a substantial increase in the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulatory analysis only addresses the LCO and SR option for controls for specific equipment relied upon
during shutdown and low-power operations, whereas the proposed rule allows for incorporation of controls included
in technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with
10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant
to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). The staff plans to revise the regulatory analysis to incorporate consideration of other alternatives
as appropriate for equipment controls during shutdown and low-power operations. In addition, the staff will consider
the following in the revised regulatory analysis: (1) insights gained from the recent NRC PRAs for shutdown and low-power
operations at Surry and Grand Gulf; (2) industry improvements made in outages; (3) comments received from ACRS, CRGR
and the Commission; (4) specific industry comments on the draft regulatory analysis documented in a letter from NUMARC
dated January 11, 1994, in a letter from NEI dated March 28, 1994 and in a letter from GEOG dated April 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has observed that many shutdown operations may take place with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment partially open. Therefore, cost-effective regulatory actions are appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure substantial reduction in core-damage probability, and an improvement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood of containment isolation, when necessary. These actions would substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the overall protection of public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Operating Experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff reviewed operating experience at nuclear power plants to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that its evaluation encompassed the range of events encountered during shutdown and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-power operations including: licensee event reports (LERs), studies performed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data (AEOD), and various inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports to determine the types of events that take place during refueling, cold and hot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shutdown, and low-power operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff also reviewed events that occurred at foreign nuclear power plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using information found in the foreign events file maintained for AEOD at the Oak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The AEOD compilation included the types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events that applied to U.S. nuclear plants and those not found in a review of U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In performing this review, the NRC staff found that the more significant events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) were the loss of residual heat removal, potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurization, and boron dilution events. The more important events for boiling-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactors (BWRs) were the loss of coolant, the loss of cooling, and potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurization. Generally, the majority of important events involved human error and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural errors. The NRC staff documented this review in NUREG&hyph;1449. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the NRC staff selected 10 events from the AEOD review for further assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as precursors to potential severe core-damage accidents. This assessment is fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented in NUREG&hyph;1449.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, undesirable events continue to occur during shutdown operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent operating experiences during shutdown include (1) entry into midloop operation with a degraded RHR pump at
a PWR on December 11, 1993, (2) the discovery of a large, undetected nitrogen gas bubble in the RCS during extended cold
shutdown at a PWR on December 17, 1993, (3) a hydrogen burn in an empty pressurizer caused by welding activities during
cold shutdown at a PWR on February 3, 1994, and (4) the loss of one train of RHR 2 days after shutdown due to outage activities
at a BWR on March 17, 1994. These recent events reinforce the previous assessment of shutdown operations documented
in NUREG&hyph;1449. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry Work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The industry has addressed outage planning and control with programs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include workshops, Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) inspections, Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI) support, as well as enhanced training and procedures. One activity (a formal initiative proposed by the Nuclear
Management and Resources Council (NUMARC)) has produced for the utilities a set of guidelines to use for self-assessment
of shutdown operations (NUMARC 91&hyph;06).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This high-level guidance addresses many, but not all, of the areas in outage planning that need improvement. Detailed
guidance on developing an outage planning program is outside the scope of the NUMARC effort. The NRC staff believes
that NUMARC 91&hyph;06 represents a significant and constructive step, effects of which have already been realized
by many utilities using the draft guidance in recent outages.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For example, on the basis of its review of operating experience and pilot team inspections, the staff observed that
industry efforts and improvements have been made which should reduce risk in the shutdown and low-power operations
area. Some licensees were observed to have in-depth contingency planning for backup cooling; other licensees were
found to have well-planned and tightly conducted outages run by outage-experienced, operationally oriented personnel;
and other licensees had developed well-defined strategies and procedures for plant and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardware configurations, including fuel offload, midloop operation in PWRs, use of nozzle dams in PWRs, venting
in PWRs, electrical equipment, onsite sources of ac power, containment status and control, and such key instrumentation
as RCS temperature, reactor water level, and RCS pressure. Further, industry
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s defense-in-depth concept for safety functions and outage strategy contained in NUMARC 91&hyph;06 have been recognized
as excellent self-improvements in the shutdown and low-power operations area. However, implementation of these
efforts and improvements has been unevenly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and inconsistently applied, as observed at several site inspections conducted by the staff.

Safety Importance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC's staff's rationale for proposing the requirements described previously is that they will provide substantial
safety improvements, and the costs of implementation are justified in view of the benefits to be provided. This judgment
is based on a qualitative assessment supplemented by a quantitative analysis. The considerations that principally
support the proposed action are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The improvements reflect the NRC safety philosophy of ``defense in depth'' in that they address: (a) Prevention
of credible challenges to safety functions through improvements in operations and fire protection; and (b) mitigation
of challenges to redundant protection systems, through improved procedures, training, improved controls on plant
equipment and contingency plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Accident sequences during shutdown which are as rapid and severe as those that might occur during power operation
should be addressed with commensurate requirements. This is supported by the staff's engineering analysis of accidents
during shutdown conditions documented in NUREG&hyph;1449. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The improvements being proposed are aimed directly at problems that have been repeatedly observed in operating
experience, e.g., loss of decay heat removal, loss of ac power, loss of RCS inventory, fires, personnel errors, poor
procedures and poor planning, and lack of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only a very limited number of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covering shutdown conditions have been performed and those studies contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable uncertainty. The uncertainty is due largely to the predominant role played by operators and other licensee
staff in shutdown events and recovery from them. Human reliability is difficult to quantify, especially under unfamiliar
conditions which are often not covered in training or procedures. The collection of PRA studies discussed in NUREG&hyph;1449
gives some insight into the likely range of shutdown risks for the spectrum of current plants. The mean CDP for shutdown
events appears to be in the range of 6E- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
05 to 7E&hyph;06 per reactor-year. Although detailed uncertainty analysis is not available for most of the PRAs covering
shutdown conditions, some insight can be gained by examining the uncertainty analysis in NUREG&hyph;1150 where
the CDP uncertainty ranges (5th and 95th percentiles) are approximately one order of magnitude. From this limited
information, the staff concludes that a reasonable estimate of the range of CDP is 1E&hyph;04 to 1E&hyph;06 per reactor-year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the analysis of operating experience in NUREG&hyph;1449, including the accident sequence precursor
analysis, the NRC staff identified the following as dominant event sequences during shutdown: loss of all ac power,
loss of RCS inventory, and loss of reactor vessel level control in PWRs. These sequences have been modeled as part of
the regulatory analysis of proposed improvements in shutdown and low-power operations. Core-damage probabilities
for these sequences are point estimates built from best estimates of each step in the sequence. No uncertainty analysis
was performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the lack of reliable statistical data for shutdown conditions. However, a sensitivity study has been performed
to assess the effect of uncertain assumptions on the overall results of the analysis. The results of the sensitivity
study show that despite sensitivity to changes in PRA assumptions, the estimated changes in risk associated with
the proposed improvements remain significant even when inputs are changed significantly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the analysis of the dominant event sequences indicate potential reductions in core-damage probability
of greater than 5E&hyph;05 per reactor-year for each PWR's improvement, and approximately 1E&hyph;05 per reactor-year
for improvement to BWRs. As previously stated, the staff recognizes that significant improvement in core-damage
probability has already been achieved through recent industry actions, however, the proposed rule would place a
regulatory ``footprint'' on outage safety and codify improvements made by industry to ensure that (1) reductions
in risk already achieved are not eroded in the future and (2) consistency and uniform achievement of the safety improvements
is realized throughout the industry. The proposed rule would also set minimum standards for all plants and further
reduce risk by improving safety in the areas of fire protection for shutdown decay heat removal and effective reactor
vessel water level instrumentation for PWRs in midloop operation.

Containment capability and releases of radioactivity for accident sequences during shutdown are also evaluated
as part of the regulatory analysis. From that work, the NRC has concluded that an intact containment will effectively
prevent early releases from shutdown accidents. Large, dry PWR containments should remain intact if closed before
being challenged. Severe core-damage accidents in open containments or in containments that fail are expected to
have offsite consequences similar to severe core-damage accidents initiating from power operations. Onsite consequences
within a few hundred meters of open or failed containments may be more severe at shutdown than at power. The potential
dose to the public for a severe core-damage accident without an effective containment was estimated to be 2E+06 person-rem
(2E+04 person-Sv).

Basis for Commission Position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC proposes to resolve concerns regarding shutdown and low-power operations by rulemaking that would require
power reactor licensees to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Assure that uncontrolled changes in reactivity, reactor coolant inventory, and loss of subcooled state in the
reactor coolant system when subcooled conditions are normally being maintained, will not occur when the plant is
in either a shutdown or low-power condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assure that containment integrity is maintained or can be reestablished in a timely manner as needed to prevent
releases in excess of the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 when the plant is in either a shutdown or low-power condition;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Identify that equipment necessary to make the reactor subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain
it subcritical in a shutdown condition, and establish controls in either technical specifications limiting conditions
for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3) or
plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5)
for that equipment such that they will ensure each safety function when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Prior to (and throughout the shutdown refueling outage as necessary to accommodate unforeseen contingencies)
entering cold shutdown or a refueling condition, evaluate realistically available fire-protection features and
the outage plan for possible fires stemming from activities conducted during cold shutdown or refueling conditions,
determine whether such fires could realistically prevent accomplishment of the normal decay heat removal capability
during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, and if so, either take measures to prevent loss of normal decay heat
removal by such fires during cold shutdown or a refueling condition, or have a contingency plan in place that will ensure
an alternate decay heat removal capability exists and that will describe the general steps to connect the alternate
decay heat removal system to the reactor coolant system (RCS); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For licensees of PWRs only, provide instrumentation for monitoring water level in the RCS during midloop operation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical basis for the NRC's staff's position is derived from the NRC staff's comprehensive evaluation of shutdown
and low-power issues in NUREG&hyph;1449, ``Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants in the United
States.'' NUREG&hyph;1449 was published as a draft report for comment in February 1992. The comment period on the
draft NUREG&hyph;1449 ended on April 30, 1992, and a large number of comments were received from utilities and industry
organizations. The NRC staff addressed the comments in the final report (NUREG&hyph;1449) which was issued in September
1993. The principal findings from NUREG&hyph;1449 that support the NRC regulatory position in this proposed rule
are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accident sequences during shutdown can be as rapid and severe as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during power operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All PWR containments and BWR (boiling-water reactor) Mark III primary containments are capable of offering significant
protection if the containment is closed or can be closed quickly. However, analyses show that the steam and radiation
environment in the containment, which can result from an extended loss of DHR or LOCA, would make it difficult to close
the containment in many cases. BWR Mark I and II secondary containments offer less protection against an accident,
but this is offset by a significantly lower likelihood of core damage in BWRs than in PWRs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Outage planning is crucial to safety during shutdown conditions since it establishes (a) if and when a licensee
will enter circumstances likely to challenge safety functions and (b) the level of mitigation equipment available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Using technical specifications to control the availability of safety-related equipment is appropriate because
(i) operators are trained and accustomed to operating the facility in accordance with approved procedures within
the clear limits set by technical specifications and (ii) technical specifications establish clear and enforceable
regulatory requirements.

The NUREG&hyph;1449 analysis only addressed the use of technical specifications for control of specific equipment
relied upon during shutdown and low-power operations. The proposed rule allows for incorporation of controls using
either technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance
with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c) (2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative
controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5).

(6) Operating experience continues to show that the ability to maintain control of RCS level in PWRs during draindown
and steady-state operation has been a problem. The principal contributor to events during some shutdown configurations
has been identified as poor quality and reliability of reactor vessel level instrumentation. This problem is most
significant during midloop operation, where a small variation in level can lead to a loss of DHR. PRAs have consistently
found a higher risk associated with midloop operation than with other operational states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements being proposed by the NRC are aimed directly at problems that have been repeatedly observed in operating
experience, such as loss of decay heat removal, loss of ac power, loss of RCS inventory, fires, personnel errors, poor
procedures, poor planning, and poor training. The proposed requirements reflect the NRC safety philosophy of defense
in depth, in that they address: (1) prevention of credible challenges to safety functions through improvements in
operations, fire protection and water level instrumentation in PWRs and (2) mitigation of challenges to redundant
protection systems, through improved equipment controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment controls must be included in either technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance
requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical
specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). Requirements for specific equipment availability
using plant procedures would be established by the licensee in a way that provides maximum flexibility by: (1) permitting
the use of non-safety as well as safety equipment to provide safety functions; (2) permitting reduced decay heat levels
to be a factor in developing such mitigating strategies as the selection of protective features and determination
of when to put such protective features into service; and (3) allowing changes regarding the availability of equipment
during the outage to be made without prior NRC review and approval. This particular resolution path has not been evaluated
explicitly in the regulatory analysis; but the NRC believes that this approach to controlling mitigative equipment
can produce a safety benefit comparable to that for the LCO approach.

Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule may result in changes to plant-specific technical specifications
as well as to the standard technical specifications documented in NUREG&hyph;1430, NUREG&hyph;1431, NUREG&hyph;1432,
NUREG&hyph;1433, and NUREG&hyph;1434 (STS for Babcock &amp; Wilcox plants, Westinghouse plants, Combustion Engineering
plants, General Electric BWR/4 plants, and General Electric BWR/6 plants, respectively). Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii)
of the proposed rule requires identified equipment controls during shutdown or low-power conditions to be established
in technical specifications or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls
in support of specific safety functions, including such support functions as electric power. Section 50.67(c)(3)(ii)
states that the controls must reflect sufficient redundancy in systems, subsystems, components, and features to
ensure that, for the onsite electric power system in operation (assuming offsite power is not available), safety
functions can be accomplished, assuming a single failure. LCOs currently used at some plants do not cover all of the
safety functions recommended in the proposed rule. For some systems, under some conditions, standard technical
specifications, as well as current plant-specific technical specifications, lack the redundancy called for in
the proposed rule.

Fire Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal regulation covering fire protection is 10 CFR 50.48. It requires all plants to have a fire protection
plan that satisfies General Design Criterion (GDC) 3 of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50. Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50 gives
specific requirements to be satisfied in complying with the regulation for plants licensed before 1979. Additionally,
guidance for satisfying the regulation is found in the branch technical positions referenced in the regulation.
However, this guidance was developed to ensure that the plant could be brought to a hot shutdown condition from power
operation during a fire and does not address the condition of being in a shutdown or refueling mode at the time of a fire.
Further, fire-protection criteria established by the regulations only require that at least one train of those systems
important for ensuring an adequate level of DHR during cold shutdown and refueling be capable of being restored to
service within 72 hours of a fire. In addition, NRC guidelines for performing a fire hazards analysis do not address
shutdown and refueling conditions, or the potential impact a fire may have on the capability to maintain shutdown
cooling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the proposed requirements in the area of fire protection during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, it is
the Commission's intent to supplement current requirements for fire protection with additional requirements to
ensure that decay heat removal capability is not lost because of a fire during cold shutdown or refueling conditions.
If the evaluation required by the proposed rule shows that fires would prevent accomplishment of normal decay heat
removal capability, the licensee must either take measures to prevent the loss of normal decay heat removal by such
fires or have a contingency plan in place that will ensure that an alternate decay heat removal capability exists during
cold shutdown or a refueling condition. The contingency plan should describe the general steps to connect the alternate
decay heat removal system to the RCS. The NRC staff recognizes that this could be done by revising existing regulations
to include detailed supplemental requirements. However, the proposed requirements state that realistic fires
during cold shutdown and refueling conditions should be evaluated rather than the more conservative fires that are
analyzed under Appendix R. This realistic evaluation of available fire-protection features and the outage plan
for possible fires should serve as the basis for further appropriate action. Permanent hardware fixes need not be
employed as an option to reduce the risk of fire during cold shutdown and refueling conditions. On the contrary, if
the evaluation results in the conclusion that some changes must be made, the licensee should consider less onerous
options to reduce the risk of fire such as: (a) modifying or relocating the activities that might cause the fire; (b)
constructing temporary fire barriers; or (c) revising plant procedures.

The NRC believes the proposed action regarding installation in a PWR of new reactor vessel water level instrumentation,
including an alarm, is a cost-justified substantial safety enhancement and the costs of implementation are justified
in the view of the substantial benefit that is provided.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 This action stems from a desire to eliminate losses of the RHR system due to air ingestion caused by operator error when
lowering water level to achieve a midloop condition. The additional level instrumentation would supplement the
improved level instrumentation adopted voluntarily by all affected licensees in response to GL 88&hyph;17, ``Loss
of Decay Heat Removal.''

The staff's regulatory analysis includes the assumption that BWR water level instrumentation will be operable during
cold shutdown and refueling operations in accordance with current standard technical specifications. The results
of the analysis support the conclusion that improvements in BWR water level instrumentation used during shutdown
operations are not warranted. Recent concerns with the accuracy of BWR water level instrumentation are being addressed
by utilities with actions in response to NRC Bulletin 93&hyph;03, dated May 28, 1993. Those actions will ensure that
BWR water level instrumentation will function as assumed in the regulatory analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC notes that, based on the available evidence, no undue public risk exists without the promulgation of the rule
for shutdown and low-power operations. The proposed rule would strengthen safety by preventing accidents and mitigating
accidents, and thereby reduce the likelihood of a core-damage accident and the offsite releases due to loss of a key
safety function during shutdown or low-power operations. Significant improvements have already been achieved
in this regard through the implementation of the NUMARC guidelines; however, the proposed rule would place a regulatory
``footprint'' on outage safety and codify improvements made by industry to ensure that (1) reductions in risk already
achieved are not eroded in the future and (2) consistency and uniform achievement of the safety improvements is realized
throughout the industry. The proposed rule would also set minimum standards for all plants and further reduce risk
by improving safety in the areas of fire protection for shutdown decay heat removal and effective reactor vessel water
level instrumentation for PWRs in midloop operation. Moreover, the overall risk may also be reduced by additional
improvements in severe accident management, given the assumption that core damage occurs, whether from an event
during an outage or during power operations. Therefore, the proposed rule should be viewed as being in the same accident
prevention context as the ATWS rule (10 CFR 50.62) and the station blackout rule (10 CFR 50.63) in that it recognizes,
as the other two rules recognize, multiple failure possibilities resulting from common cause effects that should
be addressed.

Section 50.67(c)(3)(i) of the proposed rule calls for the identification of equipment necessary to (a) make the reactor
subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain the reactor subcritical in a shutdown condition, (b)
maintain RCS inventory and capability to add makeup water to the reactor vessel, (c) remove decay heat from the reactor,
(d) monitor water level in the reactor vessel, and (e) maintain or reestablish containment integrity when the plant
is in a shutdown or low-power condition. Further, Section 50.67(c)(3)(ii) of the proposed rule requires licensees
to establish controls for the equipment identified such that they will perform their safety function when the plant
is in a shutdown or low power condition. The controls must reflect sufficient redundancy in systems, subsystems,
components, and features to ensure that, for the onsite electric power system in operation (assuming offsite power
is not available), safety functions can be accomplished, assuming a single failure, for all conditions except refueling
operations (with water level above the reactor in excess of a lower limit established in applicable technical specifications
or plant procedures). Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule specifies that the controls required by paragraph
(c)(3)(ii) be included in technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements
in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications
administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). The NRC would like to receive comments describing the possible
alternate methods for equipment controls. Additionally, the current regulatory analysis only addresses LCO and
SR changes within the technical specifications, and does not reflect the risk reduction already achieved by industry
through voluntary actions. The Commission requests information as to steps that licensees have already taken to
reduce risk during shutdown and low-power operations. Finally, the NRC would like to receive comments on the use of
probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) information and the calculation of the value of offsite dose (accident consequence)
in the cost/benefit analysis.

Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street,
N.W. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from Kulin Desai, Division of Systems

The current regulatory analysis only addresses the LCO and SR Option for controls for specific equipment relied upon
during shutdown and low-power operations, whereas the proposed rule allows for incorporation of controls including
technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with
10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant
to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). The staff plans to revise the regulatory analysis to incorporate consideration of other alternatives
as appropriate for equipment controls during shutdown and low-power operations. In addition, the staff will consider
the following in the revised regulatory analysis: (1) insights gained from the recent NRC PRAs for shutdown and low-power
operations at Surry and Grand Gulf; (2) industry improvements made in outages; (3) comments received from ACRS, CRGR
and the Commission; and (4) specific industry comments on the draft regulatory analysis documented in a letter from
NUMARC dated January 11, 1994, in a letter from NEI dated March 28, 1994 and in a letter from CEOG dated April 8, 1994.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that, if promulgated,
this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed
rule would affect only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants. The companies that own these plants do
not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' as given in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the
Small Business Size Standards in regulations issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR Part 121.

Backfit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.109, a backfit analysis has been performed for the proposed rule. The backfit analysis on which
this determination is based is included in the report entitled, ``Regulatory Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50.109:
Requirements for Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated December 1993. The backfit
analysis approach emphasized a qualitative estimation supplemented by a quantitative analysis for bounding conditions
as reflected in the regulatory analysis. The backfit analysis and the regulatory analysis will be revised based on
comments received from the public. The Commission has determined, based on this analysis, that backfitting to comply
with the requirements of this proposed rule will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a substantial increase in protection to public health and safety because it would: (1) reduce the frequency
of events caused by poor planning and control of activities during outages; (2) ensure availability of key safety
functions during shutdown and low-power operations at all plants; (3) ensure that a method of decay heat removal remains
viable in the event of a fire in any plant area during cold shutdown or refueling conditions; and (4) provide accurate
instrumentation for PWRs to use when draining the reactor coolant system to a midloop configuration to avoid air binding
and eventual loss of residual heat removal pumps. The Commission has further determined the cost of implementing
the new requirements is justified for PWRs in view of the increase in protection attributable to the proposed backfits
but plans to specifically reassess BWRs following consideration of comments on this proposed rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All licensees must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide reasonable assurance that uncontrolled changes in reactivity, uncontrolled changes in reactor coolant
inventory, and loss of subcooled state in the reactor coolant system when subcooled conditions are normally being
maintained will not occur when the plant is in either a shutdown or low power condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assure that containment integrity is maintained or can be reestablished in a timely manner as needed to prevent
releases in excess of the guidelines of 10 CFR part 100 when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) Identify that equipment (including electric power and compressed air) necessary to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Make the reactor subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain it subcritical in a shutdown condition;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Maintain reactor coolant system inventory and capability to add makeup water to the reactor vessel; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Remove decay heat from the reactor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Monitor water level in the reactor vessel; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Maintain or reestablish containment integrity when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Establish controls for the equipment identified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section such that they will perform
their safety function when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition. The controls must reflect sufficient
redundancy in systems, subsystems, components, and features to ensure that, for the onsite electric power system
in operation (assuming offsite power is not available), safety functions can be accomplished, assuming a single
failure, for all conditions except refueling operations (with water level above the reactor in excess of a lower limit
established in applicable technical specifications or plant procedures); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The controls required by paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section must be included in either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c) (2) and (3), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) Prior to (and throughout the shutdown refueling outage as necessary to accommodate unforeseen contingencies)
entering cold shutdown or a refueling condition, evaluate realistically available fire protection features and
the outage plan for possible fires stemming from activities conducted during cold shutdown or refueling conditions,
and determine realistically whether such fires could prevent accomplishment of normal decay heat removal capability
during cold shutdown or refueling conditions. If the evaluation shows that such fires would prevent accomplishment
of normal decay heat removal capability, the licensee must either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Take measures to prevent the loss of normal decay heat removal by such fires during cold shutdown or a refueling
condition; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Have a contingency plan in place that will ensure an alternate decay heat removal capability exists and that will
describe the general steps to connect the alternate decay heat removal system to the RCS. Plant staff must be trained
in the implementation of the contingency plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Implementation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) All licensees must comply with paragraph (c) of this section by no less than 6 months before the first refueling
outage that starts either 12 months or more after the effective date of this section or 12 months or more after issuance
of the Commission's regulatory guide giving details and examples of approaches to satisfy these requirements (whichever
is later). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the licensee chooses to install or modify systems, structures, or components to comply with the requirements
of paragraph (c) of this section, such hardware installation and/or modification must be completed by the end of the
first refueling outage that starts either 12 months or more after the effective date of this section or 12 months or
more after issuance of the Commission's regulatory guide giving details and examples of approaches to satisfy these
requirements (whichever is later). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All licensees must submit technical specifications required by paragraph (c)(3)(iii) within 6 months after
issuance of the final regulatory guide providing guidance on compliance with the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All licensees of PWRs, except as noted in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, must comply with paragraph (d) of this
section by the end of the first refueling outage that starts either 12 months or more after the effective date of this
section or 12 months or more after issuance of the Commission regulatory guide giving details and examples of approaches
to satisfy this requirement (whichever is later). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The requirement in paragraph (e)(4) of this section does not apply to those plants that have completely defueled
for final shutdown but still retain an operating license (i.e., those plants that are preparing for decommissioning).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and expand the set of conversion factors used to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future exposure of derivative contracts and recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of netting arrangements in the calculation of potential

The FDIC is proposing these amendments on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed revisions to the Basle Accord announced on July 15, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. The effect of the proposed amendments would be twofold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, long-dated interest rate and exchange rate contracts would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to new higher conversion factors and new conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors would be set forth that specifically apply to derivative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts related to equities, precious metals, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities. Second, institutions would be permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize a reduction in potential future exposure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions subject to qualifying bilateral netting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements.

The international risk-based capital standards (the Basle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accord or Accord)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 set forth a framework for measuring capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy under which risk-weighted assets are calculated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigning assets and off-balance-sheet items to broad categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based primarily on their credit risk, that is, the risk that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss will be incurred due to an obligor or counterparty default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a transaction.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Off-balance-sheet transactions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated into risk-weighted assets by converting each item 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a credit equivalent amount which is then assigned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate credit risk category according to the identity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligor or counterparty, or if relevant, the guarantor or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the collateral.

The Basle Accord was proposed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle Supervisors' Committee, BSC)
and endorsed by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G&hyph;10) countries in July 1988. The Basle Supervisors'
Committee is comprised of representatives of the central banks and supervisory authorities from the G&hyph;10 countries
(Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the
United States) and Luxembourg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In January 1989 the FDIC Board adopted a similar framework to be used by state nonmember banks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The credit equivalent amount of an interest rate or exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate contract (rate contract) is determined by adding together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current replacement cost (current exposure) and an estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the possible increases in future replacement cost, in view of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the volatility of the current exposure over the remaining life of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract (potential future exposure, also referred to as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
add-on). Each credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate risk category generally based on identity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counterparty. The maximum risk weight applied to interest rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exchange rate contracts is 50 percent.

A. Current Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A state nonmember bank that has a rate contract with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive mark-to-market value has a current exposure or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible loss equal to the mark-to-market value.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For risk-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital purposes, if the mark-to-market value is zero or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative, then there is no replacement cost associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract and the current exposure is zero. The sum of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures for a defined set of contracts is sometimes referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the gross current exposure for that set of contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
The loss to a bank from a counterparty's default on a rate contract is the cost of replacing the cash flows specified
by the contract. The mark-to-market value is the present value of the net cash flows specified by the contract, calculated
on the basis of current market interest and exchange rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Accord, as endorsed in 1988, provided that current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure would be determined individually for every rate contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entered into by a banking organization. Generally, institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not permitted to offset, that is, net, positive and negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mark-to-market values of multiple rate contracts with a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counterparty
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 to determine one current exposure relative to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counterparty. In April 1993 the BSC proposed a revision to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accord, endorsed by the G&hyph;10 Governors in July 1994, that permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to net positive and negative mark-to-market values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of rate contracts subject to a qualifying, legally enforceable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bilateral netting arrangement. Under the revision to the Accord, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with qualifying netting arrangements could replace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the gross current exposure of a set of contracts included in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an arrangement with a single net current exposure for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating the credit equivalent amount for the included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts. If the net market value is positive, then that market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value equals the current exposure for the netting contract. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the net market value is zero or negative, then the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure is zero.

Netting by novation however, was recognized. Netting by novation is accomplished under a written bilateral contract
providing that any obligation to deliver a given currency on a given date is automatically amalgamated with all other
obligations for the same currency and value date. The previously existing contracts are extinguished and a new contract,
for the single net amount, is legally substituted for the amalgamated gross obligations.

On July 25, 1994, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking to amend its risk-based capital guidelines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the BSC April 1993 proposal. 59 FR 37726, July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Generally, under the proposal, a bilateral netting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement would be recognized for risk-based capital purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if the netting arrangement is legally enforceable. The bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to have a legal opinion(s) to this effect. That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal is consistent with the final July 1994 change to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accord.

B. Potential Future Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The second part of the credit equivalent amount, potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future exposure, is an estimate of the additional exposure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may arise over the remaining life of the contract as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluctuations in prices or rates. Such changes may increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market value of the contract in the future and, therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the cost of replacing it if the counterparty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequently defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The add-on for potential future exposure is estimated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplying the notional principal amount
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 of the underlying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract by a credit conversion factor that is determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining maturity of the contract and the type of contract. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing set of conversion factors used to calculate potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future exposure, referred to as the add-on matrix, is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
The notional principal amount, or value, is a reference amount of money used to calculate payment streams between
the counterparties. Principal amounts generally are not exchanged in single-currency interest rate swaps, but
generally are exchanged in foreign exchange contacts (including cross-currency interest rate swaps).

The conversion factors were determined through simulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies that estimated the potential volatility of interest and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange rates and analyzed the implications of movements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those rates for the replacement costs of various types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest rate and exchange rate contracts. The simulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies were conducted only on rate contracts, because at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the Accord was being developed activity in the derivatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market was for the most part limited to these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions. The analysis produced probability distributions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential replacement costs over the remaining life of matched 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pairs of rate contracts.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Potential future exposure was then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in terms of confidence limits for these distributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conversion factors were intended to be a compromise between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precision, on the one hand, and complexity and burden, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The add-on for potential future exposure is calculated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all contracts, regardless of whether the market value is zero, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive, or negative, or whether the current exposure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated on a gross or net basis. The add-on will always be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either a positive number or zero. The recent revision to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accord to recognize netting for the calculation of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure does not affect the calculation of potential future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, which generally continues to be calculated on a gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. This means that an add-on for potential future exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is calculated separately for each individual contract subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the netting arrangement and then these individual future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures are added together to arrive at a gross add-on for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future exposure. For contracts subject to a qualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bilateral netting arrangement in accordance with the newly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted Accord changes, the gross add-on for potential future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure would be added to the net current exposure to arrive at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one credit equivalent amount for the contracts subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
netting arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original Basle Accord noted that the credit conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors in the add-on matrix were provisional and would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to revision if volatility levels or market conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed.

Since the original Accord was adopted, the derivatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market has grown and broadened. The use of certain types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivative instruments not specifically addressed in the Accord_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notably commodity, precious metal, and equity-linked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
_has become much more widespread. As a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued review of the method for calculating the add-on for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future exposure, in July 1994 the BSC issued two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals for public consultation.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The first proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the matrix of add-on factors used to calculate potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future exposure to take into account innovations in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivatives market. The second proposal would recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in the potential future exposure of derivative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts that result from entering into bilateral netting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements. The second proposal is an extension of the recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision to the Accord recognizing bilateral netting arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of calculating current exposure and would formally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extend the recognition of netting arrangements to equity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precious metals and other commodity derivative contracts. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation period for these BSC proposals is scheduled to end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on October 10, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A recently concluded BSC review of the add-on for potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future exposure indicated that the current add-on factors used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculate the potential future exposure amount may produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient capital for certain types of derivative instruments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in particular, long-dated interest rate contracts, commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts, and equity-index contracts. The BSC review indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the current add-on factors do not adequately address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full range of contract structures and the timing of cash flows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review also showed that the conversion factors many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are using to calculate potential future exposure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient capital coverage in view of the volatility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indices or prices on the underlying assets from which these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts derive their value.

While commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts were not explicity covered by the original Accord, as the use
of such contracts became more prevalent, many G&hyph;10 bank supervisors, including U.S. banking supervisors,
have informally permitted institutions to apply the conversion factors for exchange rate contracts to these types
of transactions pending development of a more appropriate treatment.

The BSC concluded that it was not appropriate to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these problems with a significant departure from the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology used in the Accord. The BSC decided that it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to preserve the conversion factors existing in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accord and add new conversion factors. Consequently, the revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by the BSC retains the existing conversion factors for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate contracts but applies new higher conversion factors to such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts with remaining maturities of five years and over.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also introduces conversion factors specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts.

The new conversion factors were determined on the basis of

Gold is included within the foreign exchange column because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the price volatility of gold has been found to be comparable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exchange rate volatility of major currencies. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the BSC determined that gold's role as a financial asset 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishes it from other precious metals. The proposed matrix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is designed to accommodate the different structures of contracts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as the observed disparities in the volatilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated indices or prices of the underlying assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two footnotes are attached to the matrix to address two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular contract structures. The first relates to contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with multiple exchanges of principal. Since the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future exposure rises generally in proportion to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of remaining exchanges, the conversion factors are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplied by the number of remaining payments (that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchanges of principal) in the contract. This treatment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to ensure that the full level of potential future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure is adequately covered. The second footnote applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity contracts that automatically reset to zero each time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is made. The credit risk associated with these contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is similar to that of a series of shorter contracts beginning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ending at each reset date. For this type of equity contract the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining maturity is set equal to the time remaining until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the capital charges resulting from the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new proposed conversion factors may not provide complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage for risks associated with any single contract, the BSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes the factors will provide a reasonable level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prudential coverage for derivative contracts on a portfolio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. Like the original matrix, the proposed expanded matrix is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to provide a reasonable balance between precision, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity and burden.

B. Recognition of the Effects of Netting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The simulation studies used to generate the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors for potential future exposure analyzed the implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of underlying rate and price movements on the current exposure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts without taking into account reductions in exposure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could result from legally enforceable netting arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the conversion factors are most appropriately applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-netted contracts, and when applied to legally enforceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
netted contracts, they could in some cases, overstate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments provided during the consultative process of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising the Basle Accord to recognize qualifying bilateral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
netting arrangements and further research conducted by the BSC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have suggested that netting arrangements can reduce not only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking organization's current exposure for the transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the netting arrangement, but also its potential future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure for those transactions.

While current exposure is intended to cover an organization's credit exposure at one point in time, potential future
exposure provides an estimate of possible increases in future replacement cost, in view of the volatility of current
exposure over the remaining life of the contract. The greater the tendency of the current exposure to fluctuate over
time, the greater the add-on for potential future exposure should be to cover expected fluctuations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As a result, in July 1994 the BSC issued a proposal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate into the calculation of the add-on for potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future exposure a method for recognizing the risk-reducing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of qualifying netting arrangements. Under the proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions could recognize these effects only for transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meet the requirements of netting for current exposure as set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in the recent amendment to the Accord. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending on market conditions and the characteristics of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank's derivative portfolio, netting arrangements can have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial effects on a bank's potential future exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple derivative contracts it has entered into with a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counterparty. Should the counterparty default at some future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, the bank's exposure would be limited to the net amount the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counterparty owes on the date of default rather than the gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current exposure of the included contracts. By entering into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
netting arrangement, a bank may reduce not only its current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, but also its future exposure as well. Nevertheless, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while in many circumstances a netting arrangement can reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future exposure of a counterparty portfolio, this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not always the case.

For purposes of this discussion, a portfolio refers to a set of contracts with a single counterparty. A bank's global
portfolio refers to all of the contracts in the institution's derivatives portfolio that are subject to qualifying

The most important factors influencing whether a netting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement will have an effect on potential future exposure are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the volatilities of the current exposure to the counterparty on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both a gross and net basis.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The volatilities of net current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure and gross current exposure of the portfolio may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily be the same. Volatility of gross current exposure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influenced primarily by the fluctuations of the market values of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positively valued contracts. Volatility of net current exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the other hand, is influenced by the fluctuations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market values of all contracts within the portfolio. In those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases where net current exposure has a tendency to fluctuate more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over time than gross current exposure, a netting arrangement will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reduce the potential future exposure. However, in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations where net current exposure has a tendency to fluctuate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less over time than gross current exposure, a netting arrangement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can reduce the potential future exposure.

Volatility in this discussion is the tendency of the market value of a contract to vary or fluctuate over time. A highly
volatile portfolio would have a tendency to fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. One of the most important
factors influencing a portfolio's volatility is the correlation of the contracts within the portfolio, that is,
the degree to which the contracts in the portfolio respond similarly to changing market conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Net current exposure is likely to be less volatile relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the volatility of gross current exposure when the portfolio of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts as a whole is more diverse than the subset of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positively valued contracts. When a netting arrangement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to a diversified portfolio and the positively valued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts within the portfolio as a group are less diversified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the overall portfolio, then the effect of the netting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement will be to reduce the potential future exposure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the portfolio.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The BSC has studied and analyzed several alternatives for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking into account the effects of netting when calculating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital charge for potential future exposure. In particular, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC reviewed one general method proposed by commenters to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 1993 netting proposal. This method would reduce the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the add-on for potential future exposure by multiplying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated gross add-on by the ratio of the portfolio's net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current exposure to gross current exposure (the net-to-gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio or NGR). The NGR is used as a proxy for the risk-reducing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of the netting arrangement on the potential future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. The more diversified the portfolio, the lower the net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current exposure tends to be relative to gross current exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BSC incorporated this method into its proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, given that there are portfolio-specific situations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the NGR does not provide a good indication of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, the BSC proposal gives only partial weight to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of the NGR on the add-on for potential future exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed method would average the amount of the add-on as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently calculated (A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
gross
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the same amount multiplied by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGR to arrive at a reduced add-on (A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
net
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for contracts subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifying netting arrangements in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements set forth in the recently amended Accord. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula is expressed as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 -->
net
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
 = .5(A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 -->
gross
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
 + (NGR * A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
)).

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, a bank with a gross current exposure of 500,000, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net current exposure of 300,000, and a gross add-on for potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future exposure of 1,200,000, would have an NGR of .6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(300,000/500,000) and would calculate A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
net
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
.5(1,200,000 + (.6 * 1,200,000))

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
For banks with an NGR of 50 percent, the effect of this treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be to permit a reduction in the amount of the add-on by 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. The BSC believes that most dealer banks are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an NGR in the vicinity of 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BSC proposal does not specify whether the NGR should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis or on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate basis for all transactions subject to qualifying, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally enforceable netting arrangements. The proposal requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether the choice of method could bias the results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and whether there is a significant difference in calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden between the two methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BSC proposal also acknowledges that simulations using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank's internal models for measuring credit risk exposure would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most likely produce the most accurate determination of the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of netting arrangements on potential future exposures. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal states that the use of such models would be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at some future date.

C. The FDIC Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the BSC proposal, the FDIC believes that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to seek comment on proposed revisions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of the add-on for potential future exposure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivative contracts. Therefore, the FDIC is proposing to amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its risk-based capital guidelines for state nonmember banks to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the matrix of conversion factors, and to permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that make use of qualifying netting arrangements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize the effects of those netting arrangements in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of the add-on for potential future exposure. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second part of the proposed amendment is contingent on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption of a final amendment to the FDIC's risk-based capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines to recognize bilateral close-out netting arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would formally extend this recognition to commodity, precious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metals, and equity derivative contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the portion of the proposal to expand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion factor matrix, the FDIC is proposing the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion factors set forth in the BSC proposal. The FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees with the BSC that the existing conversion factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to long-dated transactions do not provide sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital for the risks associated with those types of contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC also agrees with the BSC that the conversion factors for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign exchange transactions are significantly too low for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatility of the associated indices or the prices on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying assets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar to the BSC proposal, the FDIC's proposed amendment specifies that for equity contracts that automatically
reset to zero value following a payment, the remaining maturity is set equal to the time remaining until the next payment.
Also, for contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factors are to be multiplied by the number
of remaining payments in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC is proposing the same formula as the BSC proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to calculate a reduction in the add-on for potential future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure for contracts subject to qualifying netting contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC recognizes several advantages with this formula. First, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the formula uses bank-specific information to calculate the NGR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NGR is simple to calculate and uses readily available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. The FDIC believes the use of the averaging factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 0.5 is an important aspect of the proposed formula because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means the add-on for potential future exposure can never be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced to zero and banks will always hold some capital against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivative contracts, even in those instances where the net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current exposure is zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC is seeking comment on all aspects of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned earlier, the BSC proposal seeks comment on whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NGR should be calculated on a counterparty-by-counterparty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, or on a global basis for all contracts subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifying bilateral netting arrangements. The FDIC's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory language would require the calculation of a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGR for each counterparty with which it has a qualifying netting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract. However, the FDIC is also seeking comment as to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method of calculating the NGR would be most efficient and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for institutions with numerous qualifying bilateral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
netting arrangements. With either calculation method the NGR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be applied separately to adjust the add-on for potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future exposure for each netting arrangement. The FDIC notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some preliminary findings indicate that a global NGR may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less burdensome to apply since the same NGR would be used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each counterparty with a netting arrangement, but counterparty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific NGRs may provide a more accurate indication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit risk associated with each counterparty.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC does not believe that adoption of this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small business entities (in this case, small banks), in accord 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C 601 et. seq.). In this regard, while some small banks with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited derivative portfolios may experience an increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital charges, for most banks the overall effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal will be to reduce regulatory burden and to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital charge for certain transactions.

Credit Equivalent Amounts for Derivative Contracts.

The

credit equivalent amount of a derivative contract that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section II.E.3. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the current exposure (which is equal to the mark-to-market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value,
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 if positive, and is sometimes referred to as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement cost) of the contract and (ii) an estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract.

Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract
and should reflect changes in both underlying rates, prices and indices, and counterparty credit quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then the current exposure is equal to that mark-to-market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure is zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential future credit exposure of a contract, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including contracts with negative mark-to-market values, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract by one of the following credit conversion factors, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

No potential future exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based
upon two floating rate indices (so called floating/floating or basis swaps); the credit exposure on these contracts
is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values.

Risk Weights and Avoidance of Double Counting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the credit equivalent amount for a derivative contract, or a group of derivative contracts, has been determined,
that amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the
nature of any collateral. However, the maximum weight that will be applied to the credit equivalent amount of such
contracts is 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain cases, credit exposures arising from the derivative contracts covered by these guidelines may already
be reflected, in part, on the balance sheet. To avoid double counting such exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy
and, perhaps, assigning inappropriate risk weights, counterparty credit exposures arising from the types of instruments
covered by these guidelines may need to be excluded from balance sheet assets in calculating banks' risk-based capital
ratios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC notes that the conversion factors set forth in section II.E.1. of appendix A, which are based on observed volatilities
of the particular types of instruments, are subject to review and modification in light of changing volatilities
or market conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for these types of contracts are contained in table IV of
this appendix A.

Netting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values
when determining a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable
form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of derivative contracts is recognized for
purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that:

(d) The bank maintains in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of derivative contracts, including
a copy of the bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent
amount.

For purposes of this section, a walkaway clause means a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting
counterparty to make lower payments than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payments at all, to a defaulter
or to the estate of a defaulter, even if a defaulter or the estate of a defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a bank represents that
it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the bank's files and available
for inspection by the FDIC. Upon determination by the FDIC that a bank's files are inadequate or that a netting contract
may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraphs (b) (i) through (iii) of this
section, underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they were not subject to the netting contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The credit equivalent amount of derivative contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract
is calculated by adding (i) the net current exposure of the netting contract and (ii) the sum of the estimates of potential
future exposure for all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, adjusted to take into account the effects
of the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net current exposure is the sum of all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual contracts
subject to the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is positive, then the net current exposure
is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative, then the net current exposure is
zero.

contract.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 The NGR is determined as the ratio of the net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current exposure of the netting contract to the gross current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of the netting contract. The gross current exposure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sum of the current exposures of all individual contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the netting contract calculated in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section II.E.1. of this appendix A. The effect of this treatment

is that A

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document revises an earlier supplemental proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair
Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, that would have required a functional
check of the idle stop function of the engine throttle quadrant; repair or replacement, if necessary; and eventual
replacement of the engine throttle quadrant. That proposal was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown
on certain of these airplanes due to problems associated with operation of the engine throttle quadrant. This action
further revises the proposed rule by adding a second type of test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if the
throttle levers bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended
to ensure the proper operation of the throttle quadrant so as to prevent inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the
airplane is taxiing or in flight.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add an airworthiness directive (AD),
applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, was
published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33233). That supplemental NPRM would have required a functional check of the idle stop function
of the throttle quadrant; repair or replacement of the throttle quadrant if the check failed; and the eventual replacement
of the throttle quadrant with a new model. In addition, that supplemental NPRM expanded the applicability of the initially-issued
NPRM to include additional airplanes that were found to be subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That supplemental NPRM was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown that occurred on Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12
and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes when a throttle lever over-rode the idle stop during throttle retardation, due to
a quick, sharp pull on the throttle levers, and the throttle lever consequently moved directly to the shut-off position.
The proposed functional check (hereafter called ``the abrupt-movement check'') was intended to ensure that such
unintentional shutdowns of engines would not occur while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. The abrupt-movement
check procedures are described in Canadair Challenger Service Bulletins A600&hyph;0629 and A601&hyph;0410, both
dated November 1, 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent to the issuance of that supplemental NPRM, the FAA became aware that a necessary requirement, which was
previously proposed in the initially-issued NPRM, was incorrectly omitted from the supplemental NPRM. The original
NPRM was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994, (59 FR 5966). That action would have required operators to test the engine throttle quadrant to
determine if the throttle levers bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position due to side loads on the throttle levers;
quadrants that failed the test (hereafter called ``the side-load test'') would be required to be modified or replaced.
Those actions would have been required to be accomplished in accordance with the instructions contained in Canadair
Alert Service Bulletin A600&hyph;0615, dated June 10, 1992 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11 series airplanes);
or Canadair Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0374, Revision 1, dated September 30, 1992 (for Models CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12
and CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that performance of this side-load test is necessary in order to adequately address the unsafe
condition presented by the problems identified with the operation of the engine throttle quadrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should note that the originally-issued NPRM would have required that throttle quadrants failing the side-load
test be modified in accordance with the Canadair service bulletins released in 1992 (referred to above). However,
in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadair service bulletins released in November 1993 (referred to
above), throttle quadrants that failed the abrupt-movement check would be replaced with a new unit. The FAA has determined
that it is not logical to require that the throttle quadrants be modified if they fail the side-load test and subsequently
be replaced by a new unit if they fail the abrupt-movement check. The FAA has determined, instead, that both the side-load
test and the abrupt-movement check must be performed, and units that fail either test must be replaced in accordance
with the Canadair service bulletins dated November 1993. (Units that pass the tests would be required eventually
to be replaced at a later time.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the compliance time for the proposed eventual replacement of the engine throttle quadrant on all airplanes
was incorrectly expressed in the previous supplemental NPRM as ``1,200 flight hours.'' The compliance time for this
proposed requirement should have been specified as ``4,500 hours time-in-service.'' (The ``1,200'' figure actually
represented the number of landings that is approximately equivalent to 4,500 hours time-in-service for the majority
of the affected fleet.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this supplemental NPRM would require: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A one-time test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if side loads on the throttles will cause the throttle
levers to bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position, and replacement of the throttle quadrant if it fails this
test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A one-time functional check of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if a quick, sharp pull on the throttles
will cause the throttle levers to bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position, and replacement of the throttle
quadrant if it fails this functional check; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Replacement of the throttle quadrant as terminating action for the requirements of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, paragraph (e) of this supplemental NPRM indicates the corrected compliance time of ``4,500 hours
time-in-service'' for replacement of the throttle quadrant. Expressing this compliance time in terms of ``hours
time-in-service'' makes it consistent with the compliance terms for the other requirements of this proposed AD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since certain of these changes expand the scope of the previously proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary
to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Cost Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 150 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed side-loads test of the engine throttle quadrant would take approximately 17 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of this proposed requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,250, or $935 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed abrupt-movement check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant would take approximately 1
work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed functional check on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,250, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed installation of a modified throttle quadrant would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to
accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no
cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed installation on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $82,500, or $550 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
$231,000, or $1,540 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished
any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted.

Regulatory Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comment on current practices relating to
disclosure of forward-looking information. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the safe harbor
provisions for forward-looking statements (set forth in Rule 175 under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities
Act''), Rule 3b&hyph;6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), Rule 103A under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 and Rule 0&hyph;11 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) are effective in encouraging
disclosure of voluntary forward-looking information and protecting investors or, if not, should be revised and
if revised, how. The Commission also seeks comment on various changes to the existing safe harbor provisions that
have been suggested by certain commentators. Finally, the Commission is announcing that public hearings will be
held beginning February 13, 1995, to consider these issues.

Forward-looking information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occupies a vital role in the United States securities markets. Investors typically consider management's forward-looking
information important and useful in evaluating a company's economic prospects and consequently in making their
investment decisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Analysts and other market participants report that they view consideration of management's own performance projections,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 earnings and revenues, to be critical to their own forecasts of a company's future performance. As such, forward-looking
information is often considered a critical component of investment recommendations made by broker-dealers, investment
advisers and other securities professionals.

While the Wheat Commission's Report to the Commission, published in 1969, recognized that most investment decisions
are based essentially on estimates of future earnings, the Commission determined that the detriments to investors
associated with permitting forward-looking disclosure weighed against lifting the ban on disclosure of such information.
In the Wheat Commission's view, the heightened litigation exposure, updating requirements and risk of undue investor
reliance on this information outweighed any countervailing benefits.

The Wheat Report stated these findings as follows: From a management standpoint, projections may change rapidly
during a given year as changes occur in the factors on which they are based. Inclusion of such changing projections
in a prospectus, which might be used long after it became effective would give rise to significant problems. It has
been the Commission's long-standing policy not to permit projections and predictions in prospectuses and reports
filed with the Commission. Such documents are designed to elicit material facts. Their factual character is widely
recognized. Investors and their advisers are at liberty to make their own projections based on the disclosures resulting
from the Commission's requirements. A real danger exists, in the Study's judgment, that projections appearing in
prospectuses and other documents filed under securities laws and reviewed by the Commission would be accorded a greater
measure of validity by the unsophisticated than they would deserve.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission continued to consider these issues and conducted hearings in 1972 to determine whether to lift the
ban and, instead, either mandate or permit disclosure of forward-looking information. The 1972 hearings involved
fifty-three witnesses and resulted in the submission of over 200 letters of comment. A significant number of those
letters were from issuers objecting to any suggestion that they be required to file forward-looking statements with
the Commission. Following those hearings, the Commission elected in 1973 not to require disclosure of forward-looking
information, but announced in a policy statement its intention to promulgate rules to permit voluntary disclosure
of projections and to protect those projections from civil antifraud liability.

. At the same time, the Commission expressed initial approval of new Division of Corporation Finance guides designed
to encourage the inclusion of projections in Commission filings. These guides called for: (1) A good faith assessment
of the reliability of the projection; (2) a reasonable basis for that assessment; (3) outside review of the projections;
(4) the use of reasonable ranges; (5) the use of a reasonable period of projection; (6) the inclusion of assumptions
on which the projection is based; (7) the inclusion of cautionary language; and (8) disclosure of the accuracy of the
issuer's prior projections. The Commission authorized issuance of substantially similar final guides in Securities
Act Release No. 5992 (Nov. 7, 1978).

First, in recognition that the Commission needed experience with projections disclosure in order to evaluate the
wisdom of establishing a regulatory framework for such disclosure, the Committee stated that its recommendations
were intended to encourage projections on an experimental basis. Such voluntary disclosure would enable the Commission
to assess both the usefulness of the information to investors, and the costs to issuers of providing that information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If forward-looking information disclosures ultimately were found to be beneficial to investors, the Committee
believed that market forces, rather than a Commission mandate, would operate effectively to compel issuers to make
such disclosures.

Second, the Committee recommended that the Commission adopt a safe harbor that would protect forward-looking statements
made in good faith and with a reasonable basis, regardless of whether those statements were included in documents
filed with the Commission. The Committee recommended that the burden be placed on the person seeking to establish
antifraud liability for the forward-looking statement to show a lack of good faith or reasonable basis.

Third, the Committee opined that a safe harbor should be available to all registrants, regardless of size and reporting
history. It also recommended that companies be required to publish cautionary language along with the projection,
to indicate clearly the nature of the projection and caution investors against ascribing undue weight thereto.

Although the Committee recognized the value of assumptions, it opted against requiring disclosure of assumptions
for two reasons: (a) because of the experimental nature of the program, the Committee apparently concluded that fewer
mandatory disclosure items were appropriate; and (b) in order to encourage as many issuers to use the safe harbor rule
as possible, the Committee wanted to keep the rule simple and thus facilitate compliance.

While the Committee recommended that companies be reminded of their obligations to keep a published projection from
becoming misleading in light of subsequent events, it urged that no formal requirement to update projections be imposed.
In the Committee's view, companies should be permitted either to discontinue making projections or to resume such
projections after discontinuation, but should not do so without a reasonable basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee had a different view of mandatory disclosure and updating in connection with forward-looking information
disseminated during the Securities Act registration process. Specifically, the Committee expressed its opinion
that ``the Commission should require companies to include such current projections covering the current period
in their registration statements (updated as necessary) filed under the Securities Act.''

With respect to the type of information that should be disclosed, the Committee believed that companies should have
the flexibility to choose which items to disclose, but should not be permitted to disclose only ``favorable'' items.
Finally, the Committee recommended that the Commission permit third-party review of projections, provided that
the third-party reviewer's credentials, extent of review, and relationship with the issuer were disclosed.

In response to the Advisory Committee Report, the Commission announced in early 1978 that the Committee's recommended

the Commission.

As set forth in the Commission's proposing release, the differences between the two proposals, as well as the questions
asked and comments requested, reflected the Commission's reservations with respect to certain aspects of the Advisory
Committee proposal. First, the Commission was particularly concerned that the burden of proving a lack of reasonable
basis, which the Committee recommended be imposed on the plaintiff, ``could be insurmountable.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission therefore proposed an alternative rule that would have placed the burden on the defendant to prove
that a challenged projection was made in good faith and with a reasonable basis.

There were several other substantive differences between the two proposals. Unlike the Advisory Committee's proposal,
the Commission's alternative extended to third-party projections, while concomitantly restricting safe harbor
protection to financial projections and similar statements, limiting safe harbor protection to statements made
about reporting companies, and excluding statements about investment companies. Significantly, both proposed
safe harbor rules covered all oral and written forward-looking information, not just when contained in Commission
filings. Neither proposal specifically required inclusion of current projections in registration statements
filed under the Securities Act, and no mention was made in the release of the reasons for this omission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the proposals, the Commission received approximately 90 letters of comment. A majority of commenters
expressed a belief that a rule incorporating aspects of both proposals would provide the best incentive for projection
disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although a few commenters expressed continuing reservations about the Commission's proposed shift in policy from
prohibiting to encouraging projection disclosure, virtually all agreed that a safe harbor rule was desirable and
necessary.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Several commenters criticized other aspects of the Commission's alternative proposal, arguing that the burden
of proof for establishing that a projection did not have a reasonable basis or was not made in good faith should be imposed
on the plaintiff,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and that the rule's coverage should be extended beyond revenues, earnings, and ``other financial items'' to encompass
management's plans and objectives.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters argued that the rule's protections should not be limited to companies with a reporting history.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters concurred in the proposal to forego conditioning the rule's availability on inclusion of the information
in Commission filings on the ground that such a condition could result in a loss of the safe harbor's protections based
on a technical or inadvertent filing delinquency. Comments on the propriety of projections by investment companies
were mixed.

In 1979, the Commission adopted a safe harbor provision that generally combined aspects of both proposals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Virtually identical safe harbor provisions were codified in Rule 175 under the Securities Act and Rule 3b&hyph;6
under the Exchange Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These provisions offered safe harbor protection for specified forward-looking statements but only where made,
reaffirmed, or later published, in documents filed with the Commission. On this point, the Commission stated that
this ``filing'' requirement would provide investors with better access to the information and a more reliable framework
within which to evaluate the forward-looking statement, and would enable the Commission to maintain oversight of
the accuracy and completeness of the disclosure.

Second, the final rule incorporated the Advisory Committee's recommendation of placing the burden of proof on the
plaintiff to show that the forward-looking information lacked a reasonable basis and was made otherwise than in good
faith. The Commission reasoned that the liberal discovery procedures available in the federal courts had permitted
plaintiffs to elicit the evidence necessary to sustain this burden. The Commission stated that it would monitor the
operation of the safe harbor rule to assure that it was not inconsistent with the pre-eminent statutory goal of investor
protection.

The safe harbor provision, as adopted, did not require the publication of assumptions underlying forward-looking
statements covered by the rule. In describing the basis for this decision, the Commission ``re-emphasize[d] its
position on the significance of assumption disclosures,'' explaining that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
Under certain circumstances the disclosure of underlying assumptions may be material to an understanding of the
projected results. The Commission also believes that the key assumptions underlying a forward-looking statement
are of such significance that their disclosure may be necessary in order for such statements to meet the reasonable
basis and good faith standards embodied in the rule. Because of the potential importance of assumptions to investor
understanding and in order to encourage their disclosure, the rule as adopted indicates specifically that disclosed
assumptions are also within its scope.

The Commission made explicit the availability of the safe harbor to third-party reviewers, both those retained by
the company and those making projections on behalf of management. Also, while not adding any requirement to update
projections, the Commission reiterated its earlier position that projections protected by the safe harbor must
be corrected when subsequent events or discoveries render them false or misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission elected not to extend coverage of the rule to investment companies registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. While not rejecting the possibility that projections could be valuable to shareholders of registered
investment companies, the Commission stated that ``the nature of information reported by investment companies
is sufficiently distinct to warrant separate consideration.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1979, the Commission has further refined its position on disclosure of forward-looking information, particularly
in the context of developing and interpreting the management's discussion and analysis (``MD&amp;A'') requirements
applicable to the Form 10&hyph;K and other required filings, as codified in Regulation S&hyph;K Item 303.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An instruction to Item 303(a) states that the MD&amp;A ``shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties
known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of [the] future
*&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In contrast to this required disclosure of ``presently known data which will impact upon future operating results,''
registrants are expressly encouraged, but not required, to supply forward-looking information.

Both required disclosure regarding the future impact of presently known trends, events or uncertainties and optional
forward-looking information may involve some prediction or projection. The distinction between the two rests with
the nature of the prediction required. Required disclosure is based on currently known trends, events, and uncertainties
that are reasonably expected to have material effects, such as: a reduction in the registrant's product prices; erosion
in the registrant's market share; changes in insurance coverage; or the likely non-renewal of a material contract.
In contrast, optional forward-looking disclosure involves anticipating a future trend or event or anticipating
a less predictable impact of a known event, trend or uncertainty.

Thus, the Commission has distinguished between mandatory and voluntary forward-looking statements for disclosure
purposes. Moreover, in the context of transactions involving an issuer's or affiliate's purchase of the issuer's

There appears to be increasing interest, on the part of both registrants and users of their financial reports in the
investor and analyst communities, in enhanced disclosure of information that may affect corporate performance
but is not readily susceptible of measurement in traditional, quantitative terms.

 Among such qualitative informational items are workforce training and development, product and process quality
and customer satisfaction. A large registrant considers one such item_product quality_to be so important to its
profitability that it has chosen to make it a key determinant of executive compensation.

foreign companies, institutional investors, analysts, and U.S. regulators. Charged with developing a systemic
approach to disclosure of corporate performance, both on a financial and non-financial basis, by the spring of 1995,
the Group is exploring ways of: (a) Encouraging companies to report their use of qualitative performance criteria
despite the perceived litigation risk; and (b) educating institutional investors, analysts and others as to the
utility of such information and its relationship to such quantitatively measured indicia of corporate performance
as earnings.

 the court found that while predictions could properly be characterized as facts, the failure of a prediction to prove
true was not in itself actionable. Instead, the court looked at the factual representations which it found were impliedly
made in connection with the prediction; namely that, at the time the prediction was made, it was believed by its proponent
and it had a valid basis.

a claim under Rule 10b&hyph;5. As we have consistently held, scienter is an element of such a claim. *&blank;*&blank;*
Plaintiffs have satisfied the pleading requirements for scienter. They have claimed that the defendants either

Some courts have taken a more extreme position, determining that, even without cautionary language, some predictions
are not material. For example, referring to ``soft,'' ``puffing'' statements, upon which no reasonable investor
would rely, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that, ``projections of future performance not worded
as guarantees are generally not actionable under the federal securities laws.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some critics argue that the current safe harbor is ineffective largely because it is too narrow, in that it only covers
statements made in documents filed with the Commission.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
68
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 They contend that, due to this underinclusiveness, the safe harbor provides no comfort in most situations involving
disclosure of forward-looking information. While acknowledging concern that the problem of selective disclosure
prompted the Commission to adopt such a limitation in 1979,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
69
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 these critics contend that this very limitation has created the unintended by-product of fostering such selective
disclosure.

Many public companies complain that they face increasing analyst and institutional demands for immediate access
to predictive information. Some issuers argue that, solely to gain the benefits of the safe harbor through reaffirmation
of oral responses to recurring marketplace inquiries in Commission documents, they would be put to the impossible
task of memorializing every analyst discussion. Given the informal and often unpredictable nature of communications
between issuers and analysts, the provision in the safe harbor requiring Commission filing of forward-looking information
is viewed as both counterproductive and highly impractical.

B. Judicial Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another complaint commonly raised is that the provisions of the existing safe harbor do not influence the standards
that courts apply in securities fraud cases. The safe harbor is infrequently raised by defendants, perhaps because
it compels judicial examination of reasonableness and good faith, which raise factual issues that often preclude
early, prediscovery dismissal. Thus, critics state that the safe harbor is ineffective in ensuring the quick and
inexpensive dismissal of frivolous private lawsuits. These critics argue that, unless the courts vigorously apply
a higher pleading threshold sufficient to sustain a motion to dismiss based on the allegations of a class-action complaint,
the mere threat of litigation will continue both to discourage management from making forward-looking disclosure
and cause those companies that nonetheless provide such disclosure to incur significant costs in defense of nonmeritorious
litigation. Those urging reform thus maintain that, in order for a safe harbor effectively to encourage forward-looking
disclosure, it must add protection over and above those afforded by judicial doctrines developed under what are characterized
as the ``housekeeping'' provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure_Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A further criticism of the Commission's existing safe harbor is that the rule has created confusion over whether and
when there is a duty to correct or update projections once they are made. A recent article suggests that issuers are
often advised by their counsel to refrain from making forward-looking statements in Commission filings, or even
from speaking to analysts, because they fear that by doing so they will ``assume'' a duty to update their forward-looking
statements as and when the facts and circumstances surrounding their original statements change.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
73
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Furthermore, the paucity of caselaw in this area has left issuers without comfort or certainty as to when and if there
is any duty to update or correct.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

74
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

if at all, an issuer must continue to update.

Another concern voiced by companies is whether to make forward-looking disclosures to securities analysts and institutional
investors, whether in the context of initial public offering ``roadshows'' or otherwise, and the corresponding
liability for any forward-looking statements included in the analysts' reports or statements. Companies complain
that a better balance must be struck between the incentives and disincentives of disclosure to analysts.

The foregoing regulatory incentives must be viewed in light of potential issuer liabilities. While courts appear
generally to impose no duty on a corporation to review or comment on analysts' reports, a corporation may become sufficiently
entangled with the analysts' statements, by reviewing or correcting drafts of reports or otherwise, so as to assume
a duty to correct or update the analyst's statements.

the safe harbor. Where specific proposed regulatory text has been provided by these commentators or groups, that
text is attached in the appendix to this release.

A. ``Seasoned Issuer'' Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Seasoned Issuer'' Proposal, suggested by the Association of Publicly Traded Companies (``APTC''), would
provide a safe harbor precluding private actions for oral and written forward-looking statements with respect to
securities quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market or listed on a national securities exchange. It would apply only to secondary
trading transactions and would not modify the Commission's enforcement authority. The proposed safe harbor would
be available to issuers subject to the reporting requirements of sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that have
timely filed all reports required to be filed within the six months prior to the making of the statement. The proposed
safe harbor would not be available to penny stock issuers. It also excludes issuers that had been convicted of securities
law violations or issuers that had been the subject of any securities related injunction within the previous five
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``forward-looking statement'' is defined in the proposed safe harbor to include any economic projection,

B. Business Judgment Rule Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commissioner Beese has proposed a safe harbor provision patterned after the state-law ``business judgment rule.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
83
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the pattern of that rule, the safe harbor would establish a principle of judicial non-intervention. As such, the
safe harbor would protect directors and officers from judicial review of shareholder antifraud claims when forward-looking
statements are made unless a plaintiff can establish a conflict, a lack of good faith, or a failure of honest and reasonable
belief.

The safe harbor would cover oral or written forward-looking information, whether or not made or reaffirmed in Commission
filings. Liability still could be imposed on directors or officers who make fraudulent statements, intentionally
misstate facts, or fail to disclose material information when required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that an officer or director was meeting his duties under the business judgment rule, a company would be encouraged
to keep a projection binder reflecting the data underlying the projections. In the event that a private lawsuit was
filed, the company would proffer the binder to the court. The burden then would shift to the plaintiffs to show why the
projections lacked a proper factual basis at the time they were made. If unable to meet this burden, the case would be
dismissed without any discovery.

C. ``Heightened Definition'' Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Heightened Definition'' Proposal, put forth jointly by the Business Roundtable and the National Association
of Manufacturers, would apply to all forward-looking statements and reaffirmations thereof, by or on behalf of a
registrant or an outside reviewer retained by the registrant, whether or not filed with the Commission. The proposed
safe harbor would apply to the same information as is protected by the current safe harbor but would expressly extend
to both qualitative and quantitative statements of management's plans and objectives for future operations, including
plans for the development and delivery of new products or services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision would apply to all statements of reporting issuers that have timely filed their most recent annual report.
As provided under the existing rule, non-reporting issuers also could rely on the safe harbor, but only if the forward-looking
statement were made in a solicitation of interest document submitted under Securities Act Rule 254, in a registration
statement or Regulation A Offering Circular filed under the Securities Act, or in a registration statement filed
under the Exchange Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Liability would be imposed only if a misstatement or omission is material, made or omitted with scienter, and, for
private plaintiffs, relied upon. Materiality would be defined as information that would significantly alter the
total mix of information available. Scienter would be defined as actual knowledge or intentional omission to state
a material fact. Reliance would be defined as actual knowledge of and actual reliance on the forward-looking statement
in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. Under the proposal, there would be no attribution to the issuer
of statements made by third parties unless the issuer expressly endorsed or approved of the statement. Finally, an
issuer would not have a duty to update a forward-looking statement unless it expressly undertook to do so at the time
the statement was made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. ``Bespeaks Caution'' Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Professor John Coffee suggests a safe harbor that would codify a variant of the ``Bespeaks Caution'' doctrine_articulated
in terms of an investor's inability to rely in an action for fraud upon statements protected by the safe harbor. Under
this proposed safe harbor, which would be available to reporting companies (except penny-stock issuers), a forward-looking
statement would be protected so long as it were properly qualified and accompanied by ``clear and specific'' cautionary
language that explains in detail sufficient to inform a reasonable person of both the approximate level of risk associated
with that statement and the basis therefor. Forward-looking statements made, either orally or in writing, outside
the four corners of a Commission filing would be covered only if reaffirmed in a filed document or annual report made
publicly available within a reasonable period after the statement is first disseminated. The suggested safe harbor
would not require that the forward-looking statement have a ``reasonable basis'' (as under existing Rules 175 and
3b&hyph;6) because, according to Professor Coffee, this requirement often raises factual issues that cannot easily
be resolved at the pre-trial stage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Professor Coffee's approach also contemplates amendments to the incorporation-by-reference provisions of the
Securities Act registration forms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
85
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that would exempt qualifying forward-looking statements made in Exchange Act filings from automatic incorporation
by reference in Securities Act filings, and therefore from potential liability under the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Act. Existing Rule 175 would remain available where registrants affirmatively seek inclusion of
Exchange Act filings in Securities Act registration statements.

E. ``Fraudulent Intent'' Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the ``Fraudulent Intent'' proposal, submitted by Mr. William Freeman, a forward-looking statement would
be protected by the safe harbor unless it is shown that the statement was made recklessly or with an actual intent to
deceive. In order to demonstrate that a statement was made recklessly, a plaintiff would be required to demonstrate
that at the time the statement was made, the issuer was aware of facts that made it highly unlikely that the projection
could be achieved.

F. ``Disimplication'' Theory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Professor Joseph A. Grundfest has suggested that, just as the courts have implied the existence of a private right
of action under Rule 10b&hyph;5, the Commission may disimply such a right of action by redefining the element of a private
Rule 10b&hyph;5 claim.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
86
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For example, Professor Grundfest has suggested that if the Commission should decide that if ``projections deserve
greater protection than is now afforded by Rule 175, then Rule 10b&hyph;5 can be amended to require a showing of `knowing
securities fraud,' demonstrating `actual knowledge that the [projection] is false,' as a precondition for private
recovery in a Rule 10b&hyph;5 action complaining of a falsely optimistic projection.''

G. Reasonable Basis In Fact Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Reasonable Basis In Fact'' proposal, suggested by Jonathan Cuneo on behalf of the National Association of Securities
and Commercial Attorneys (``NASCAT'') protects forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether
or not filed with the Commission, unless it can be shown that the statement was made without a reasonable basis in fact,
was seriously undermined by existing facts, was not genuinely believed or was made other than in good faith.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``forward-looking statement'' is defined to include any statement concerning future revenues, income,
earnings, capital expenditures, dividends, products, services or lines of business, capital structure or other
financial items, as well as management's plans or objectives for the future or the future economic performance of
the corporation. The term also includes statements or assumptions underlying or relating to the foregoing.

H. ``Opt-In'' Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Opt-In'' proposal, suggested by Harvey Pitt, Karl Groskaufmanis and Gilbey Strub, would require issuers to
make a formal election to ``opt in[to]'' a specified safe harbor disclosure regime.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
88
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Issuers opting in would be required to make forward-looking disclosure for a minimum of four quarters. Before a company
may ``opt out'' of the safe harbor disclosure regime, it must provide notice 30 days before its next periodic report.
The notice must detail the reasons for opting out, and statements therein would not be protected by the safe harbor.
The company would be prohibited from opting back into the safe harbor disclosure regime for another year.

In order to be protected, the statements must have an adequate basis in fact, be issued in good faith and be consistent
with any similar forward-looking information used contemporaneously by the issuer. For an issuer that has ``opted

are made in bad faith or without a reasonable basis.

V. Solicitation of Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission seeks comment on a number of issues. Commenters should discuss both the continuing effectiveness
of the current safe harbors in accomplishing the primary goal of encouraging broader dissemination of forward-looking
information to the investing public, and whether the Commission should consider any change to the current safe harbor.
Would one or more of the proposals outlined above, any combination thereof, or any other proposal commenters may wish
to identify, fulfill this goal more effectively without compromising investor protection? Do the concerns outlined
in Part III above, either individually or in the aggregate, warrant revisiting and/or revising the existing safe
harbor? Commenters should explain in detail all bases for their conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Types of Information Covered by a Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assuming a safe harbor continues to be necessary or appropriate in the interests of the investing public, commenters
should discuss what types of information should be eligible for safe harbor coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supporting safe harbor coverage for forward-looking information should address the reasons justifying
a distinction between forward-looking and historical information (either purely retrospective or based on estimate
or opinion) with respect to the level of protection afforded to each. Does the fact that the person making the statements
has unique knowledge concerning the basis for forward-looking statements, support or undercut this distinction?
Commenters may wish to specify whether qualitative information, including but not limited to the type described
above in Part I, is relevant to investors such that its disclosure should be encouraged. If so, should such information
be included in the safe harbor? Should forward-looking information that is currently part of required audited financial
information (such as loan-loss reserves, pension liabilities or contingent environmental liabilities) be included?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
89
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Are there certain types of forward-looking information that should be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
excluded from the safe harbor (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
such as required audited information, or the ``known trends and uncertainties'' disclosure required by the MD&amp;A)?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should the safe harbor distinguish between oral and written statements, between statements filed with the Commission
and non-filed statements, or between Securities Act required statements and others? Should the Commission require
that any oral statement for which safe harbor coverage is sought be reduced to writing and filed with the Commission
at or around the time that statement is first disseminated? If not, commenters should describe the legal and/or practical
impediments, if any, to a contemporaneous filing requirement. Are there certain situations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an initial public offering, in which safe harbor protection should be limited to statements made in Commission filings?
Are commenters' views on these questions affected by the type of forward-looking information under consideration?
For example, do different types of forward-looking information imply different degrees of reliability, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
numerical financial projections as opposed to general statements of management's outlook? If so, should a broader
safe harbor provide protection for a narrower category of information than does Rule 175 currently, or would differing
safe harbors be warranted? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Voluntary Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should the Commission continue its current general policy of voluntary disclosure of forward-looking information
or should some or all of such information, given its significance, be mandated? If left voluntary, should any such
information used in the offer or sale of securities by the issuer be required to be included in the prospectus? Would
this be an appropriate solution to the issue of selective disclosure of key soft information during road shows? If
not, commenters should explain this conclusion and discuss alternative approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Scope of the Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should the safe harbor be procedurally based or substantively based or both? For example, should the safe harbor be
available only if the forward-looking information is reviewed by the board Audit Committee, or some other board level
committee or committee of top management or an outside reviewer, or should the standard be a substantive one dependent
on the reasonableness or other criteria of the information itself, regardless of the review process, or both?

D. Eligibility for and Conditions To Use of Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should all issuers be eligible for the safe harbor or only certain issuers that satisfy specified conditions, such
as sufficient reporting history and/or public float to ensure a market following? What other conditions might be
appropriate? Should issuers be required to opt-in or opt-out of a safe harbor alone or in combination with the foregoing?
If so, what should the opt-in/opt-out conditions be? Should an issuer be required to specify that it is seeking the
protection of the safe harbor by making a public filing, or by stating with regard to each safe harbor-eligible statement
(where the issuer chooses the safe harbor's protection), that the statement is being made subject to the safe harbor,
or by otherwise providing a ``bespeaks caution'' or other cautionary language? How could this condition be met (or
policed) for oral statements or written statements made outside of Commission filings? Should the burden of proof
be shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant corporation, generally or with respect to certain types of disclosures,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, written statements outside Commission filings, oral statements, etc.? Should shareholders be permitted, or required
to vote on the availability of any safe harbor? If so, should shareholders be permitted to approve or authorize more
extensive safe harbors than those that would otherwise be available at the election of the issuer? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should the safe harbor require disclosure of key assumptions because that information is uniquely within the control
of the issuer? If assumptions were required to be disclosed along with the forward-looking information, how would
this affect the judicial treatment of forward-looking cases? For example, if assumptions were required to be disclosed,
would it make it easier for courts to evaluate motions to dismiss cases on a procedural motion and/or impose sanctions
for the bringing of frivolous suits? Would this requirement be more or less effective coupled with any proposed litigation
reforms? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should the safe harbor be unavailable (or provide greater or absolute protection) if an insider, or specified insiders,
traded (or no insider, or specified insiders, traded) within a specified period where the insiders(s) avoided a loss
or made a gain (or failed to do so) based on the dissemination and subsequent correction of the forward-looking statement?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Elements of the Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters should outline and discuss each element of an effective safe harbor. In this connection, should the safe
harbor set forth a separate definition of materiality differing from that otherwise applicable under Commission
rules and case law? Should the safe harbor impose and/or specify parameters for a duty to update or correct? Should
the safe harbor require that a private plaintiff establish that he or she actually relied on forward-looking statements?
Should a new definition of scienter be included in the safe harbor, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by eliminating recklessness as an element of proof? In answering this question, commenters should discuss separately
implied and express rights of action, as well as Commission and private actions. Should a safe harbor include judicially
developed concepts such as the ``business judgment rule,'' ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine and/or any other judicial
approaches discussed in the release? What treatment should the safe harbor give to information that the issuer does
not disclose that may be relevant to evaluating the forward-looking statement? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Private Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should the safe harbor distinguish between Commission enforcement action and private actions? Should the answer
to the foregoing question depend on whether the underlying cause of action is express or implied? Would the Commission
be able to compensate through enhanced enforcement for any reduction in the number of private suits in this area resulting
from adoption of a particular safe harbor? How would any limitation on private actions, whether directly imposed
or incorporated in a safe harbor, affect the Commission's longstanding policy of promoting private actions for fraud
as a necessary supplement to Commission enforcement?

Should private litigants be required to pursue any antifraud claims arising from statements covered by a safe harbor
in a nonjudicial forum_for example, through arbitration or some other form of alternate dispute resolution? Some
commentators have suggested that a safe harbor should be adopted that would permit private antifraud actions to proceed
only if the Commission first brings a successful enforcement action for fraud. Commenters are invited to address
the merits of this suggestion and means of its implementation.

G. Issuer Duties Under the Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should an issuer be required to update any forward-looking information? If so, for how long? Should the answer turn
on whether disclosure is mandated by the Commission's disclosure requirements (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, MD&amp;A) or voluntary? Should an issuer be required to compare projections to actual results to provide information
as to the reliability of the projections? Should an issuer be required to disclose and/or to file assumptions or the
basis for a statement, as now required for issuers that elect to provide option grant values calculated under the option
pricing models?

Should the safe harbor require a registrant to correct forward-looking information rendered false or misleading
after its initial disclosure? Should this duty extend only to information filed with the Commission? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should a duty be imposed on issuers to update and/or correct forward-looking information disclosed by others? Should
the safe harbor expressly provide that there is no duty to update and/or correct statements made by others? Should
the safe harbor include a duty to update and/or correct statements only if the issuer becomes sufficiently ``entangled''
with the third party? If so, should the safe harbor delineate those acts or omissions that would support a finding of
entanglement?

H. Registered Investment Companies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Is the forward-looking information that might be disclosed by registered investment companies, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
projections of fund performance, inappropriate for the protection of the safe harbor because it is contingent on
the performance of the securities markets, and therefore subject to greater uncertainty and frequency of change?
Do any other characteristics of registered investment companies warrant separate treatment of their forward-looking
disclosure for purposes of the safe harbor or, more generally, should such disclosure by registered investment companies
be afforded any protection under a safe harbor? Comment also is specifically invited as to whether distinctions should
be made among different kinds of registered investment companies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
open-end and closed-end, unit investment trust and management) for the purpose of encouraging forward-looking
disclosure and providing safe harbor protection? In light of the fact that investment companies, unlike most other
public companies, are not currently required to file current reports (Form 8&hyph;K) or quarterly reports (Form
10&hyph;Q), commenters should address how projections or other forward-looking information by investment companies
would be revised or updated.

I. Multiple Safe Harbors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some suggest that if private actions were to be reduced or eliminated, some issuers would be willing to make additional
filings with the Commission, either in connection with current periodic reports or on a new disclosure form, and be
subjected to greater Commission oversight with lower thresholds for Commission enforcement actions and greater
restrictions on information that can be provided orally. Other issuers may find these protections unnecessary,
but would benefit from a safe harbor that simply made certain types of antifraud claims more difficult to prosecute
successfully. Would it be reasonable to provide for or make available different types of safe harbors tailored to
the particularized needs of differently situated issuers? Specifically, does the need for heightened protections
of statements to analysts, whether oral or written, vary with the size and/or reporting history of the issuer? Should
a different, more rigorous, safe harbor be made available to companies conducting an initial public offering, than
that made available to companies with reporting histories? For example, are smaller issuers potentially affected
differently than larger issuers so that different safe harbors should be available? Should the existing safe harbors
in the Trust Indenture Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act also be modified and, if so, why?

J. Possible Alternatives or Supplements to a Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters also may wish to discuss whether there are alternatives to a safe harbor that would accomplish the same
goal of promoting enhanced disclosure of forward-looking information. For example, are there reforms with regard
to the content and/or presentation of soft information_whether within or outside of Commission filings_that would
obviate the need for a safe harbor or the need to change the current safe harbor? Are there litigation reforms relating
more broadly to the scope of antifraud liability under the securities laws that would obviate the need for the safe
harbor? For example, could an issuer be presumed to have no liability for forward-looking statements otherwise eligible
for the safe harbor unless the named plaintiff or group of plaintiffs represents at least a minimum percentage (say
10%) of the affected shareholder class? To the extent that the current safe harbor is strengthened in favor of issuers,
should there be concomitant strengthening of other safeguards for investors? In this regard, commenters may wish
to discuss the practicality of accomplishing any such reforms, and the likelihood that any such reforms would succeed.
In lieu of or in addition to revising the existing safe harbor, should the Commission redefine one or more elements
of a private Rule 10b-5 claim (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

VI. Public Hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issues addressed in this release have attracted the interest of investors, registrants, analysts and other market
participants, as well as lawyers, accountants, federal legislators and academics. In view of this broad interest,
as well as the importance and complexity of these issues, the Commission intends to authorize public hearings to be
conducted after the close of the comment period. Among other matters, these hearings will explore the assumptions
underlying the different views expressed by these and other members of the public. Testimony from witnesses will
be elicited about the efficacy and potential effects of different safe harbor approaches, the costs and benefits
of each approach, the design of any safe harbor and issues that may be raised by the comment letters. After these hearings,
the Commission will determine whether to propose amendments to the rules regarding forward-looking information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearings will begin at 10 a.m. on February 13, 1995 at 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 room 1C30. The
agenda and format for the hearings, as well as the schedule of witnesses will be announced in a subsequent release to
be issued shortly before the hearings commence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the public interested in testifying at the hearing should notify the Commission in writing of their intention
to appear no later than December 31, 1994. The written notification should include a brief summary of the individual's
intended testimony. Any person who does not wish to appear at the hearing may submit written testimony to be included
in the hearing record. Such written testimony should be received by the Commission no later than January 11, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All written notifications, testimony and comment letters should be addressed in triplicate to Jonathan Katz, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 and should refer to the comment file number of this release [S7&hyph;29&hyph;94].
All written submissions and a transcript of the hearings will be made available for public inspection and copying
in the Commission's Public Reference Room. The hearings will be open to the public.

(4) The issuer is not subject to any order, judgement or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction temporarily

Preliminary Note 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has recognized for many years that investors make decisions about the purchase and sale of securities
with the future in mind. The market value of securities accordingly reflects the judgments of investors about the
future economic performance of an issuer. Notwithstanding the inherent uncertainty of all statements about the
future, investors regard forward-looking statements by issuers as an important source of relevant information.
Forward-looking statements therefore make an important contribution to the efficiency of the U.S. securities markets,
and the Commission wishes to encourage issuers to make such statements. At the same time, the Commission recognizes
that issuers have a justified concern about becoming involved in litigation arising out of such statements. As the
Supreme Court has observed, ``even a complaint which by objective standards may have very little success at trial
has a settlement value to the plaintiff out of any proportion to its prospect of success at trial so long as he may prevent
the suit from being resolved against him by dismissal or summary judgment. The very pendency of the lawsuit may frustrate
or delay normal business activity of the defendant which is totally unrelated to the lawsuit.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to encourage the release by issuers of forward-looking information, the Commission has adopted this ``safe
harbor'' rule. The Commission encourages the courts to apply the rule so as to implement the Commission's intent,
i.e., to provide issuers with reasonable assurance regarding the standards that will govern their liability for
such information while at the same time assessing liability where an issuer's conduct falls outside the rule and is
otherwise actionable under the federal securities laws.

Act of 1940; and

(a) A statement within the coverage of paragraph (b) of this section which is made by or on behalf of an issuer or by an
outside reviewer retained by an issuer shall be deemed not to be a fraudulent statement (as defined in paragraph (d)
of this section), unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed recklessly or with actual intent to
deceive. A forward looking statement will not be deemed to be made or reaffirmed recklessly unless it is shown that
the issuer was, or had to be, aware of facts that made it highly unlikely that the projection could be achieved.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains proposed regulations relating to gasohol blending and the taxes on diesel fuel and compressed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural gas. This document also proposes to remove obsolete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excise tax regulations. The proposed regulations reflect and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement certain changes made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Energy Act) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 (the 1993 Act). The proposed regulations relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline and diesel fuel affect certain blenders, enterers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial users, refiners, terminal operators, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughputters. The proposed regulations relating to compressed natural gas affect persons that sell or buy compressed
natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective January 1, 1994, the 1993 Act amends section 4081 to impose the diesel fuel tax in the same manner as the gasoline
tax. Thus, tax is imposed on (1) the removal of gasoline and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel (collectively taxable fuel) from any refinery, (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the removal of taxable fuel from any terminal, (3) the entry of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable fuel into the United States for consumption, use, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warehousing, and (4) the sale of taxable fuel to an unregistered person unless there was a prior taxable removal, entry,
or sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the taxable fuel. However, tax does not apply to any entry or removal of taxable fuel transferred in bulk to a refinery
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal if the persons involved (including the terminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator) are registered by the IRS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conforming Amendments to Gasoline Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 30, 1993, the IRS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63069) temporary regulations under section 4081 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the imposition of the diesel fuel excise tax for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel that is removed at a terminal rack, removed from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refinery, entered into the United States, or blended outside of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bulk/transfer terminal system. Those rules are similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules relating to the removal, entry, or blending of gasoline under &sect;&sect;48.4081&hyph;2 and 48.4081&hyph;3.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations generally consolidate the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to gasoline and diesel fuel into a single set of rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all taxable fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Compressed Natural Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective October 1, 1993, section 4041(a)(3) (added to the Internal Revenue Code by section 13241(e) of the 1993
Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes a tax on compressed natural gas (CNG) that is sold for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use or used as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide rules relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of, and liability for, the tax on CNG. These rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are similar to the regulations relating to taxes on special motor fuels imposed by section 4041. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Gasohol; Tolerance Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The gasoline tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon (the regular rate). However, a reduction from the regular rate is allowed
for gasohol (a gasoline/alcohol mixture). Before January 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4081(c) treated a mixture of gasoline and alcohol as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasohol only if at least 10 percent of the mixture was alcohol. The rate reduction under pre-1993 law was 5.4 cents per
gallon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for gasohol containing ethanol and 6 cents per gallon for gasohol containing alcohol other than ethanol. This was
equivalent to a subsidy of 54 cents or 60 cents per gallon of alcohol used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce gasohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 48.4081&hyph;6(b)(2) provides a special rule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the ``at least 10 percent'' requirement by allowing a tolerance for mixtures that contain less than
10 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. Under the tolerance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, a portion of the mixture equal to the number of gallons of alcohol in the mixture multiplied by 10 is considered
to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasohol. Any excess liquid in the mixture is taxed at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular rate. Absent the tolerance rule, pre-1993 law would have taxed the entire mixture at the regular rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tolerance rule accommodates operational problems associated with the blending of gasohol. For example, blenders
may fail to attain the required 10-percent alcohol level because the device used to meter the amount of gasoline or
alcohol added to a tank truck is imprecise or because the high-speed gasoline or alcohol pump used does not shut off
at the proper moment. Blenders cannot compensate for these errors by aiming for an alcohol content in excess of 10 percent
because Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules do not authorize the sale of gasohol containing more than 10
percent alcohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective January 1, 1993, section 1920 of the Energy Act amended section 4081(c) to allow a reduction from the regular
rate for mixtures containing at least 5.7 percent alcohol but less than 7.7 percent alcohol (5.7 percent gasohol)
and mixtures containing at least 7.7 percent alcohol but less than 10 percent alcohol (7.7 percent gasohol). The 5.4-
and 6-cents-per-gallon rate reductions were retained for mixtures containing at least 10 percent alcohol (10 percent
gasohol) and were prorated for 5.7 percent and 7.7 percent gasohol to maintain the subsidy level of 54 cents or 60 cents
per gallon, respectively, for ethanol or other alcohol that is mixed with gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations continue the present tolerance rule for mixtures that contain less than 10 percent alcohol
but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. However, a similar rule is not extended to mixtures that contain less than 7.7 or 5.7
percent alcohol because blenders can compensate for any operational problems by aiming for an alcohol content above
7.7 or 5.7 percent without violating EPA rules.

Gasohol; Blender Credit or Payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a gasohol blender produces gasohol from gasoline that was taxed at the regular rate, section 6427(f) allows the
gasohol blender to obtain a partial credit or payment relating to that tax. The proposed regulations provide the conditions
under which a credit or payment under section 6427(f) will be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Gasohol; ETBE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations under section 40 provide that alcohol used to produce ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) generally
is treated as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
alcohol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for purposes of the alcohol fuels credit when the ETBE is mixed with gasoline. The proposed regulations provide a similar
rule with respect to alcohol used to produce ETBE for purposes of the reduced tax rates for gasohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a gasoline/ETBE mixture would qualify as 5.7 percent gasohol if the mixture contains 12.7 percent ETBE
and each gallon of ETBE is made from .45 gallon of alcohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reliance on These Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations are being issued in proposed form to provide timely guidance to taxpayers and to allow interested
parties appropriate opportunity to provide comments before issuance of final regulations. Although final regulations
may include changes made, for example, in response to comments, taxpayers may rely on the proposed regulations until
final regulations are issued. For example, alcohol used to produce ETBE is treated as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
alcohol 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for purposes of the gasohol tax rates.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tax is imposed on the sale of CNG that is not in connection with the delivery of the CNG into the fuel supply tank of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The buyer has given the seller a written statement stating that the entire quantity of the CNG covered by the statement

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The taxes imposed under this section do not apply to a delivery or sale of CNG for a use described in &sect;48.4082&hyph;4T(c)(1)
through (5)(A) or (6) through (11). However, if the person otherwise liable for tax under this section is the seller

Products derived from alcohol. Alcohol 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section that is chemically transformed in producing another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product so that the alcohol is no longer present as a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical in the other product, provided that there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant loss in the energy content of the alcohol. Thus, for example, alcohol described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)
and (ii) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section that is used to produce ethyl tertiary butyl ether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ETBE) in a chemical reaction in which there is no significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss in the energy content of the alcohol is treated as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
alcohol 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the ETBE is mixed with gasoline.

Gasohol

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Gasohol is a mixture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline and alcohol that is 10 percent gasohol, 7.7 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasohol, or 5.7 percent gasohol immediately after the mixture is blended. The determination of whether a particular
mixture is 10 percent gasohol, 7.7 percent gasohol, or 5.7 percent gasohol is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made on a batch-by-batch basis. A batch of gasohol is a discrete mixture of gasoline and alcohol. If a batch is splash
blended, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contents of the batch typically correspond to a gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meter delivery ticket and an alcohol meter delivery ticket, each of which shows the number of gallons of liquid delivered
into the mixture. In such case, the volume of each component in a batch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(without adjustment for temperature) ordinarily is determined by the number of metered gallons shown on the delivery
tickets for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the gasoline and alcohol delivered. However, if a blender adds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metered gallons of gasoline and alcohol to a tank already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing more than a minor amount of liquid (other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasohol), the determination of whether a batch is gasohol and of its type will be made by taking into account the amount
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol and non-alcohol fuel contained in the liquid already in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tank. Ordinarily, any amount in excess of 0.5 percent of the capacity of the tank will not be considered minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
10 percent gasohol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A batch of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline/alcohol mixture is 10 percent gasohol if it contains at least 10 percent alcohol by volume, without rounding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Batches containing less than 10 percent but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a batch of mixture contains less than 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rounding, a portion of the batch is considered to be 10 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasohol. That portion equals the number of gallons of alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the batch multiplied by 10. Any remaining liquid in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
excess liquid. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If tax was imposed on the excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid at the gasohol production rate (as defined in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)(1) of this section), the excess liquid in the batch is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be gasoline with respect to which there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to blend into gasohol for purposes of paragraph (g) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. Excess liquid is considered to be removed before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the removal of the gasohol portion. If tax was imposed on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess liquid at the rate of tax described in section 4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is not allowed
with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the excess liquid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Examples
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This paragraph (b)(2) may be illustrated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following examples. In these examples, a gasohol blender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creates a gasoline/alcohol mixture by pumping a specified amount of gasoline into an empty tank. The blender then
splash blends a specified amount of alcohol into gasoline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. Mixtures containing exactly 10 percent alcohol. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 7200 metered gallons of gasoline and 800 metered gallons of alcohol. Accordingly, the mixture contains 10 percent
alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blender) and qualifies as 10 percent gasohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. Mixtures containing less than 10 percent alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicable delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tickets show that the mixture is made with 7205 metered gallons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gasoline and 795 metered gallons of alcohol. Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture contains less than 10 percent alcohol, but more than 9.8 percent alcohol, (as determined based on the delivery
tickets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to the blender), 7950 gallons of the mixture qualify as 10 percent gasohol. If tax was imposed on the gasoline
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture at the gasohol production rate, the remaining 50 gallons of the mixture are treated as gasoline with respect
to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there was a failure to blend into gasohol for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (g) of this section. If tax was imposed on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline in the mixture at the rate of tax described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is allowed only with respect to 7155 gallons of gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicable delivery tickets show that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture is made with 7550 metered gallons of gasoline and 450 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metered gallons of alcohol. Because the mixture contains only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.625 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tickets provided to the blender), the mixture does not qualify as gasohol.

Tax is imposed on the entry, removal, or sale of gasoline (including excess

liquid described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to which tax was imposed at a gasohol production
tax rate if_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The gasoline was not blended into gasohol; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The gasoline was blended into gasohol but the gasohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production tax rate applicable to the type of gasohol produced is greater than the rate of tax originally imposed on
the gasoline.

Rate of tax. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rate of tax imposed on gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the rate of tax applicable to gasoline not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in this section and the rate of tax previously imposed on the gasoline. The rate of tax imposed on gasoline
described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section is the difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the gasohol production tax rate applicable to the type of gasohol produced and the rate of tax previously imposed
on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (g)(2): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A registered gasohol blender bought gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in connection with a removal described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Based on the blender's certification
(described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) that the blender would produce 10 percent gasohol with the gasoline,
tax at the gasohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol was imposed on the removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The blender then produced a mixture by splash blending in a tank holding approximately 8000 gallons of mixture.
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture was blended by first pumping 7220 metered gallons of gasoline into
the empty tank, and then pumping 780 metered gallons of alcohol into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank. Because the mixture contains 9.75 percent alcohol (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the blender) the entire mixture qualifies as 7.7 percent gasohol,
rather than 10 percent gasohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Because the 7220 gallons of gasoline were taxed at the gasohol production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol
but the gasoline was blended into 7.7 percent gasohol, a failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blend has occurred with respect to the gasoline. As the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that bought the gasoline in connection with the taxable removal, the blender is liable for the tax imposed under paragraph

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g)(2)(i) of this section. The amount of tax imposed is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to 7.7 percent gasohol; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to 10 percent gasohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Because the gasohol does not contain exactly 7.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent alcohol, the benefit of the gasohol production tax rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the alcohol is less than the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol mixture credit under section 40(b) (determined before the application of section 40(c). Accordingly, the
blender may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitled to claim an alcohol mixture credit for the alcohol used in the gasohol. Under section 40(c), however, the
amount of the alcohol mixture credit must be reduced to take into account the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit provided with respect to the alcohol by the gasohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production tax rate.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia on
November 4, 1992. The revision consists of amendments to Virginia's definition of the term volatile organic compound
(VOC) and administrative changes to Virginia's lists of emission control areas for VOC and oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Virginia's November 4, 1992, SIP revision submittal also contained an emission statement regulation. The portion
of Virginia's November 4, 1992, submittal pertaining to emission statements is the subject of a separate rulemaking
action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is approving the Commonwealth's November 4, 1992, SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal
because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed
rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule and technical support document (TSD) prepared for
that rulemaking action. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity
is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn
and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will
not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do
so at this time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum
elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which
EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs. See 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992).
These rules are codified at title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop,
and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant
to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date,
or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.

II. Proposed Action and Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Support Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Governor of Wisconsin submitted Wisconsin's title V Operating Permits Program on January 27, 1994. The EPA deemed
the submittal complete in a letter to the Governor dated March 24, 1994. The submittal contained all required elements
of 40 CFR 70.4, including a description of Wisconsin's operating permits program, permitting program documentation,
and the Attorney General's legal opinion that the laws of the State of Wisconsin provide adequate authority to carry
out all aspects of the program required by the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Governor's letter to EPA states that Wisconsin's operating permits program will cover all geographical areas
of Wisconsin, except for activities conducted by Indians on Indian reservation lands. Except for a brief reiteration
of this statement in the program description, there is no further discussion in the submittal of any basis under which
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) might assert jurisdiction over sources on tribal lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because WDNR has not demonstrated, consistent with applicable principles of Indian law and Federal Indian policies,
legal authority to regulate sources on tribal lands, the proposed interim approval of Wisconsin's operating permits
program will not extend to lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation in the State of Wisconsin.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title V sources located within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Wisconsin will be subject to either
the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or to a tribal operating permits program
approved pursuant to title V and the regulations that will be promulgated under section 301(d) of the Act. The section
301(d) regulations will authorize EPA to treat tribes in the same manner as States for appropriate Act provisions.

2. Regulations and Program Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wisconsin's operating permits program, including the operating permits program regulations (Chapters Natural
Resources (NR) 400, 406, 407, 409, 410, 436, 438, 439, 484, 490, and 494, Wisconsin Administrative Code) substantially
meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, including: &sect;&sect;70.2 and 70.3 with respect to applicability; &sect;70.5
with respect to application forms, completeness requirements, and criteria for defining insignificant activities;
&sect;&sect;70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 with respect to permit content (including operational flexibility); &sect;&sect;70.7
and 70.8 with respect to permit processing requirements (including minor permit modifications and public participation);
and &sect;70.11 with respect to enforcement authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two references in Wisconsin's regulations which incorrectly cite the program's compliance certification
requirements. The reference in section NR 407.09(4)(a)3.c., Wisconsin Administrative Code (s.NR 407.09(4)(a)3.c.,
Wis. Adm. Code) to s.NR 439.03(7) is incorrect. The correct reference is s.NR 439.03(8). The reference in s.NR 439.03(1)(c),
Wis. Adm. Code, to s.NR 439.03(7) is incorrect. The correct reference is s.NR 439.03(8). WDNR is aware of these incorrect
citations and is planning to correct them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a detailed analysis of Wisconsin's program submittal, please refer to the Technical Support Document (TSD) for
this proposed action, which is available in the docket at the address noted above. The TSD shows that all operating
permits program requirements of title V of the Act, 40 CFR part 70, and relevant guidance were met by Wisconsin's submittal,
with the exception of those requirements described in subpart II.B. below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Permit Fee Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wisconsin's operating permits program fee schedule is established in section 144.399, Wisconsin Statutes (s. 144.399,
Wis. Stats.), and in Chapters NR 410 and 438, Wis. Adm. Code. Wisconsin's fee schedule is based on the presumptive minimum
program cost established in 40 CFR 70.9, and exceeds the presumptive minimum because the State charges fees for more
pollutants than those included in the 40 CFR 70.2 definition of ``regulated pollutant (for presumptive fee calculation)''.
In fiscal year 1995, WDNR estimates the dollar per ton fee to be $30.18 (assuming a 3% increase in the Consumer Price
Index). Using the presumptive minimum model, the presumptive cost of the program in fiscal year 1995 is $8,201,717.
WDNR's estimated fees for fiscal year 1995 is $8,435,612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's approval of Wisconsin's fee schedule does not extend to fees collected pursuant to s.144.399(2)(am), Wis.
Stats. and s.NR 410.04(4), Wis. Adm. Code. These provisions allow WDNR to collect emissions fees from utilities with
affected units under section 404 of the Act during the years 1995 through 1999. 40 CFR 70.9(b)(4) provides that, for
1995 through 1999, no fee for purposes of title V shall be required to be paid with respect to emissions from any affected
unit under section 404 of the Act.

4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Authority for Section 112 Implementation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all
section 112 toxics requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in Wisconsin's enabling
legislation and in regulatory provisions that define ``applicable requirements'' and provide that the permit must
incorporate all applicable requirements. The EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient to allow
Wisconsin to issue permits to part 70 sources that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Wisconsin is able to carry out all section 112 activities
for part 70 sources. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the TSD for this proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Implementation of Section 112(g) Upon Program Approval
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Wisconsin is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from
the effective date of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of Maximum Achievable Control
Technology or offsets under section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable
restrictions on a source-specific basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Wisconsin's preconstruction permitting
program found in Chapters 406 and 408, Wis. Adm. Code, under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose
of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period between title V approval and adoption of a State rule
implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. The EPA believes this approval is necessary so that Wisconsin has
a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions for section 112(g) purposes from the date of
part 70 approval. Although section 112(l) generally provides authority for approval of State air programs to implement
section 112(g), title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited approval because of the direct linkage
between the implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly limited to section
112(g) and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under the Act, for example, section
110. If Wisconsin does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate
that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, EPA may, in the final action on Wisconsin's part
70 program, approve the alternative instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the State adopts regulations consistent with any regulations
promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval
to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Wisconsin, acting expeditiously,
will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing here to limit
the duration of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations. Comment is
solicited on whether 18 months is an appropriate period, considering Wisconsin's procedures for adoption of regulations.

c. Program for Straight Delegation of Section 112 Standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for operating permits program approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), also address section 112(l)(5)
requirements for approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply
to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate
resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Wisconsin's program
for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated.
Because Wisconsin has the authority under s.144.394(12), Wis. Stats., to include any conditions in an operating
permit that are applicable to a source under the Act (including section 112 requirements), EPA proposes to approve
the delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation. The details of this delegation mechanism
will be set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Wisconsin and EPA. This program applies to both existing and
future standards, but is limited to sources covered by the part 70 program.

d. Implementation of Title IV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin's operating permits program contains adequate authority to issue permits which include the requirements
of the title IV Acid Rain Program. The WDNR also committed in the program submittal to adopting and submitting to EPA
by January 1, 1995, a program implementing the Acid Rain Program.

B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the title V operating permits program submitted by the State of Wisconsin
on January 27, 1994. This interim approval of Wisconsin's operating permits program applies to all title V sources,
with the exception of sources on Indian lands and source categories described in the source category limited interim
approval below (following B.8.). Non-major stationary sources that may be required to obtain a title V operating
permit are currently exempted from the program under 40 CFR 70.3. Wisconsin's operating permits program for non-title
V sources has been submitted as a revision to Wisconsin's State Implementation Plan and is currently under EPA review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If interim approval of Wisconsin's title V operating permits program is promulgated, the State must make the following
changes to receive full approval: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Revise Wisconsin's operating permit program regulations to provide for criminal fines against any person who
knowingly makes any false material statement, representation, or certification in a permit application. This provision
is required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(iii). The June 21, 1993, memorandum included in the Attorney General's opinion
states that s.144.426(2)(a), Wis. Stats., does not penalize a person who knowingly submits false information because
the statutes do not require the submittal of accurate information to obtain a permit. However, the memorandum further
explains that WDNR has the authority to promulgate a rule requiring the submittal of accurate information. Section
NR 439.03(11), Wis. Adm. Code, provides that all reports required by an operating permit shall be truthful. However,
there is no regulatory provision which requires the application submittal itself to be truthful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise the following legislation and regulations to provide an application shield for ``new'' and ``modified
sources'' (as defined by ss.144.30(20s) and (20e), Wis. Stats.): s.144.391(1)(b), Wis. Stats.; s.144.3925(7),
Wis. Stats.; s.NR 407.06(2), Wis. Adm. Code; and s.NR 407.08, Wis. Adm. Code. Wisconsin's program does provide an
application shield for ``existing sources'' (as defined by s.144.30(13). 40 CFR 70.7(b) requires that the application
shield must apply to all part 70 sources which meet the application shield requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Revise the following legislation and regulation to provide for operational flexibility for ``new'' and ``modified
sources'' (as defined by ss.144.30(20s) and (20e), Wis. Stats.): s.144.391(4m), Wis. Stats.; and s.NR 407.025,
Wis. Adm. Code. Wisconsin's program does provide for operational flexibility for ``existing sources'' (as defined
by s.144.30(13). 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12) requires that permit flexibility apply to all part 70 sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Revise the appropriate legislation and regulations to provide the authority to deny a renewal application for
a source that is not in compliance. 40 CFR 70.6(a)(6)(i) requires that any permit noncompliance is grounds for denial
of a permit renewal application. Section NR 407.09(1)(f)1., Wis. Adm. Code, states that the authority to deny a permit
renewal application for noncompliance is contingent upon the requirements in s.144.3925(6), Wis. Stats., which
do not currently provide for a denial in such a circumstance. Appendix P of Wisconsin's operating permits program
submittal includes draft statutory revisions that are intended to fix this deficiency. The draft revisions propose
to add this authority to s.144.396(3)(c), Wis. Stats. Regardless of the statutory placement of this authority, s.NR
407.09(1)(f)1., Wis. Adm. Code, must be revised if necessary to reference the correct statutory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Revise ss.NR 407.14(1)(b), (c), (d), and (h), Wis. Adm. Code, to provide that if the conditions specified in these
provisions are met, WDNR is required to reopen a permit for cause. Under the State's current provisions, reopening
a permit under these circumstances is discretionary. 40 CFR 70.7(f)(1) establishes the conditions under which reopening
a permit for cause is mandatory. However, the conditions of ss.NR 407.14(1)(c) and (d), Wis. Adm. Code, are only mandatory
if they meet the 3 year requirement under 40 CFR 70.7(f)(1)(i), or are acid rain requirements under 40 CFR 70.7(f)(1)(ii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Revise s.NR 407.05, Wis. Adm. Code, to include the duty to supplement or correct application provisions, as required
under 40 CFR 70.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Revise s.144.3935(1)(a), Wis. Stats., to provide WDNR the authority to issue operating permits to ``new'' and
``modified'' part 70 sources (as defined by ss.144.30(20s) and (20e), Wis. Stats.) that are not in compliance. 40
CFR 70.3(a) requires that the permitting agency must have authority to issue permits to all prt 70 sources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revise s.NR 407.05(4)(h)2.c., Wis. Adm. Code, to provide that compliance plan application requirements for noncomplying
new and modified sources include a narrative description of how the sources will achieve compliance. 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(ii)(C)
requires this compliance plan application requirement for all part 70 sources that are not in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revise s.NR 407.05(4)(h)3.c., Wis. Adm. Code, to provide for schedule of compliance application requirements for
noncomplying new and modified sources. 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C) requires schedules of compliance in all noncomplying
part 70 source applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revise s.NR 407.05(4)(h)4., Wis. Adm. Code, to provide for progress report application requirements for noncomplying
new and modified sources. 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iv) requires progress report schedules in all noncomplying part 70 source
applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revise s.NR 407.09(4)(b), Wis. Adm. Code, to provide for schedule of compliance and progress report requirements
in permits issued to noncomplying new and modified sources. 40 CFR 70.6(c)(3) and (4) require schedule of compliance
and progress report requirements in all part 70 permits that are issued to noncomplying sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Revise ss.NR 407.03(1)(d), (g), (h), (o), (s), (sm), and (t), Wis. Adm. Code, to ensure that no part 70 sources are
exempted from the requirement to obtain an operating permit, as provided under 40 CFR 70.3. Section NR 407.03(1)(t)
potentially exempts certain part 70 sources, and ss.NR 407.03(1)(d), (g), (h), (o), (s), and (sm) do not provide for
adequate procedures to limit these sources' potential to emit. The 40 CFR 70.2 definition of ``major source'' considers
the potential to emit of a source in determining major source status. The Wisconsin permitting exemptions listed
above determine applicability based in part or totally on these sources' actual emissions or throughput, and the
provisions in s.NR 407.03(4) do not provide an enforceable mechanism for limiting these sources' potential emissions
to the actual emissions levels or throughput established in the exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WDNR has demonstrated that the additional exemptions provided for in s.NR 407.03 are acceptable because they do not
exempt part 70 sources from the operating permit program. These exemptions are further analyzed in the TSD for this
proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible for interim approval, 40 CFR 70.4(d)(3)(ii) requires that a program provide for adequate authority
to issue permits containing all applicable requirements to all title V sources. Due to the deficiencies outlined
in 7. and 8. above, EPA is proposing that Wisconsin's operating permit program be granted source category limited
interim approval. See 57 FR 32270 (July 21, 1992). Therefore, EPA is not proposing to include ``new'' and ``modified''
part 70 sources that are not in compliance (as defined by Wisconsin's operating permits program), and part 70 sources
covered by Chapter NR 407.03(1)(d), (g), (h), (o), (s), (sm), and (t) as part of the interim approval of Wisconsin's
program. The exclusion of these source categories from approval, however, does not affect Wisconsin's obligation
to fix these deficiencies in order to be eligible for full approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the deficiency outlined in 7. above, EPA considers the legislative drafting oversight in the use of the term ``existing
source'' in a manner inconsistent with the definition of the term to be a compelling reason for granting source category
limited interim approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the deficiency outlined in 8. above, EPA considers the lack of EPA guidance in developing prohibitory rules at
the time Wisconsin promulgated its operating permits regulations to be a compelling reason for granting source category
limited interim approval. For the deficiency with the s.NR 407.03(1)(t) exemption, EPA considers the additional
analysis provided by WDNR showing that the exemption could potentially exempt title V sources to be a compelling reason
for granting source category limited interim approval. At the time of Wisconsin's operating permits program submittal,
WDNR had determined that this exemption would not exclude any title V sources from the requirement to obtain an operating
permit. However, WDNR later determined that this exemption could exclude title V sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin has not requested additional time for issuing initial operating permits, as the State intends to fix the
source category limited interim approval deficiencies in time to permit all sources within the 3 year phase-in period.
In addition, based on estimates provided by WDNR, EPA believes that only a small number of sources and a small amount
of emissions would be affected by source category limited interim approval. For example, WDNR estimates that only
2 or 3 sources per year will be affected by the noncomplying new and modified source deficiency. WDNR is also not aware
of any part 70 sources that would meet the s.NR 407.03(1)(t) exemption provisions. For further information, refer
to the TSD for this proposed action. EPA has determined that Wisconsin's operating permits program can issue permits
to a sufficient number of part 70 sources, and can do so on a schedule that substantially meets the requirements of part
70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to 2 years. During the interim approval period,
the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal
permits program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect
to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim
approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As outlined in II.A.4.c. above, EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of
the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards
as promulgated. This program for delegations only applies to sources covered by the part 70 program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating permit program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permit program approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning operating permit programs on such grounds.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region VII announces its intent to delete the NWSPCC Site, Mason City,
Iowa, from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances
Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on this proposed deletion. The EPA identifies sites that
appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list
of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance Response
Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the National Contingency Plan (NCP), any site deleted from the NPL
remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if conditions at the site warrant such action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP establishes the criteria that EPA uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e), sites
may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA, in consultation
with the State, will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and no further response action
by responsible parties is appropriate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 300.425(e)(2) of the NCP requires State concurrence before deleting a site from the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individuals rights or obligations. The
NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management. As is mentioned in Section
II of this document, &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP makes clear that deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude
eligibility for future Fund-financed response actions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA Region VII will accept and evaluate public comments before making the final decision to delete the site from
the NPL. The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments
from the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community are likely to be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used for the intended
deletion of the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The EPA Region VII has recommended the deletion and prepared the relevant documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State of Iowa has concurred with the deletion decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Concurrent with this National Notice of Intent to Delete a notice has been published in local and community newspapers
and has been distributed to appropriate federal, state, and local officials and other interested parties. This notice
announces a thirty (30) day public comment period on the deletion package, which starts November 3, 1994, and which
will conclude on December 5, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repository.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before the final decision to delete is
made. The Region will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, if necessary, which will address any comments received during
the public comment period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following summary provides the Agency's rationale for recommending deletion of the Northwestern States Portland
Cement Company Site, Mason City, Iowa, from the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northwestern States Portland Cement Company (NWSPCC), owns and operates a cement manufacturing facility on the
north side of Mason City, Iowa. The facility has been in operation since 1908. A byproduct of the cement manufacturing
process since 1969 is cement kiln dust (CKD). The West Quarry site (Site) is a quarry covering approximately 150 acres
to a depth of 40 feet of which approximately 110 acres were filled with CKD during the period of 1969&hyph;1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pH monitoring program of the water in the West Quarry was started in April of 1974 in response to a change in color of
the Quarry water. The Quarry water pH rose sharply following January 1976, increased to 11.8 in April 1976, and leveled
off at about 12.5 in 1980. The increase in pH is attributed to the breakdown of the natural buffering system which was
sustaining the Quarry water at a near-neutral pH. In response to Quarry dewatering initiated in 1987, current pH levels
are about 10.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1979, two seeps emerged from the northeastern portion of the filled West Quarry. High pH water from the seeps flowed
overland to Calmus Creek. In 1984, the state initiated a study of Calmus Creek and found pH in the creek elevated 2.0
pH units downstream of the seep area. In April 1985, the state ordered NWSPCC to immediately cease discharge from the
seep area to Calmus Creek. NWSPCC was also ordered to cease kiln dust disposal in the Quarry and to conduct a hydrogeologic
investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, the state did a follow-up stream survey of Calmus Creek. The 1989 study concluded that there had been no improvement
in water quality since the 1984 study. Conclusions from the 1989 study suggested that runoff from the haul roads and
storage areas was contributing to the water quality degradation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, a Calmus Creek stream study was done to meet requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
permit issued by Iowa Department of National Resources. The results of this study suggested water quality had improved
with pH dropping from 10.2 in earlier studies to 7.9. The study attributed this improvement to elimination of runoff
from the site and the installation of the groundwater extraction/treatment system installed in 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, EPA conducted a Site Inspection of the NWSPCC Site and, based on the findings of this investigation, the Site
was scored with the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) for possible inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL). Based
on the site characterization completed under the direction of EPA, an HRS package for the Site resulted in a score of
57.80. This score was based on the impact to groundwater and direct human contact. The Site was proposed for the National
Priority List (NPL), in June of 1988 (53 FR 23988). The Site was added to the NPL in August of 1990 (55 FR 35501). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RI/FS field work and data collection activities began in August 1988 with the final report submitted in March 1990.
The investigation demonstrated that significant impact to groundwater outside the Site boundaries had not occurred.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U. S. Public Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), conducted a draft Health
Assessment for the NWSPCC Site. They concluded that the Site is of potential health concern because of the potential
risk to human health resulting from possible exposure to hazardous substances at concentrations that may result
in adverse health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final Record of Decision (ROD), was executed in June 1990 by the EPA with concurrence by IDNR. The selected response
action addressed the principal threats of surface water and groundwater contamination and the source of contamination_the
cement kiln dust. The selected remedy consisted of the following actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Dewatering of the Site which contained high pH water, acid-neutralization and discharge to Calmus Creek.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Construction of a permanent drain system in the dewatered Site to collect precipitation runoff and groundwater
inflow to the quarry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Placement of an engineered clay cap over the area of the Site filled with cement kiln dust to minimize infiltration
through the kiln dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Installation of bedrock dewatering wells to collect contaminated groundwater beneath the Site, prevent
migration of contaminated groundwater from the Site and maintain groundwater levels below the kiln dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Treatment of contaminated water to meet IDNR/NPDES discharge permit limits with discharge to Calmus Creek.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Assurances that the dewatering system will be operated in perpetuity to maintain isolation of water from the
waste kiln dust and collect and treat any contaminated water which is generated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Consent Decree was signed in June 1990 which outlined the performance criteria to be met by implementing the approved
remedial action alternative as well as the reporting and scheduling requirements of the remedial design and construction
activities. The final Remedial Design and Remedial Action Work Plans were completed in June 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA in consultation with the State of Iowa, has determined that all fund-financed response activities under CERCLA
at the NWSPCC Site, Mason City, Iowa, have been completed and that no further response is necessary. Therefore, it
is proposed to delete the Site from the NPL.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Interior is initiating a biennial review of the regulations for assessing natural resource
damages resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under the Clean Water Act or a release of a hazardous
substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The regulations provide
procedures that Federal, State, and Indian tribe natural resource trustees may use to obtain compensation from potentially
responsible parties for injuries to natural resources. The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting
assessments as well as two types of technical procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. ``Type
A'' procedures are standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation in cases
of minor discharges or releases in certain environments. ``Type B'' procedures are site-specific procedures for
detailed assessments in other cases. This advance notice solicits comment on how the administrative process and
all but one of the type B procedures should be revised.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the commencement of a review of regulations for assessing natural resource damages under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) (CERCLA)
and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA). Under CERCLA, certain categories of potentially
responsible parties (PRPs) are liable for natural resource damages resulting from a release of a hazardous substance.
CERCLA sec. 107(a). Natural resource damages are monetary compensation for injury to, destruction of, or loss of
natural resources. CERCLA sec. 107(a)(4)(C). CWA creates similar liability for natural resource damages resulting
from discharges of oil into navigable waters. CWA sec. 311(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only designated natural resource trustees may recover natural resource damages. CWA recognizes the authority of
Federal and State officials to serve as natural resource trustees. CERCLA recognizes the authority of Federal and
State officials as well as Indian tribes to act as natural resource trustees. CERCLA defines ``State'' to include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands,
the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession over which the United States has
jurisdiction. CERCLA sec. 101(27).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries that are not fully remedied by response actions as well
as public economic values lost from the date of the discharge or release until the resources have fully recovered.
All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). Trustee officials may also recover
the reasonable costs of assessing natural resource damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CERCLA requires the promulgation of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting either
from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA
sec. 301(c)(1). These regulations are to identify the ``best available'' procedures for assessing natural resource
damages. CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2). CERCLA requires that the natural resource damage assessment regulations include
two types of assessment procedures. ``Type A'' procedures are ``standard procedures for simplified assessments
requiring minimal field observation.'' CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2)(A). ``Type B'' procedures are ``alternative protocols
for conducting assessments in individual cases.'' CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2)(B). Assessments performed by Federal
and State trustee officials in accordance with the natural resource damage assessment regulations receive a rebuttable
presumption in court. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department
of the Interior (the Department). E.O. 12316, as amended by E.O. 12580. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The natural resource damage provisions of CWA were amended by the Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA).
The authority to sue for natural resource damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters was extended
to not only Federal and State natural resource trustees but also Indian tribe and foreign natural resource trustees.
OPA also authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop new natural resource
damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters. The Department is coordinating its rulemakings
with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent appropriate, that consistent processes are established for assessing
natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPA provides that any rule in effect under a law replaced by OPA will continue in effect until superseded. OPA sec. 6001(b).
In particular, Senate committee report language makes it clear that ``[t]he existing Interior Department rules
*&blank;*&blank;* may be used with a rebuttable presumption in the interim'' until NOAA promulgates new regulations.
S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;94, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1990). Therefore, until NOAA promulgates its regulations, the
Department's regulations may be used to obtain a rebuttable presumption for natural resource damage assessments
under OPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's natural resource damage assessment regulations must be reviewed, and revised as appropriate,
every two years. CERCLA sec. 301(c)(3). The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as technical type A and type B procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. The purpose
of this advance notice is to announce the beginning of the biennial review of the administrative process and all but
one of the type B procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Overview of the Department's Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has published various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug.
1, 1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are
codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 43 CFR part 11. The Department also recently published a final rule revising
the administrative process and the type B procedures that has not yet been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.
59 FR 14261 (March 25, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting
assessments. The administrative process consists of four phases: The Preassessment Phase, the Assessment Plan
Phase, the Assessment Phase, and the Post-Assessment Phase. The regulations also provide technical type A and type
B procedures to be used during the Assessment Phase for the actual determination of injuries and damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During this biennial review, the Department intends to examine all aspects of the Preassessment Phase, Assessment
Plan Phase, and Post-Assessment Phase, as well as all but one of the type B procedures available for use during the Assessment
Phase. The Department is providing the following brief summary of its existing regulations to assist commenters.
Commenters should consult 43 CFR part 11 and 59 FR 14261 to obtain more detailed information about the administrative
process and type B procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Preassessment Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Preassessment Phase covers the activities that precede the actual assessment. Upon detecting or receiving notification
of a discharge or release, trustee officials decide whether further assessment actions are warranted. The Department's
regulations provide a number of criteria to assist trustee officials in making this decision. The trustee officials'
decision is documented in the Preassessment Screen Determination. For more information on the Preassessment Phase,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If trustee officials decide during the Preassessment Phase that the criteria for continuing an assessment have been
met, they then enter the Assessment Plan Phase. The Assessment Plan Phase includes various notification and coordination
activities. The Department's regulations provide guidance on coordination among trustee officials, including
selection of a ``lead authorized official'' to act as an administrative point of contact. Trustee officials are also
required to notify the PRPs of their intent to perform an assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the Assessment Plan Phase, trustee officials also prepare a written Assessment Plan describing the procedures,
type A, type B, or both, that will be used to determine injury and damages. The Assessment Plan is designed to focus and
organize the assessment, which helps ensure that only reasonable assessment costs are incurred. The Assessment
Plan is subject to public review and comment. For more information on the Assessment Plan Phase, see subpart C of 43
CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14281&hyph;83. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Assessment Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the Assessment Phase, the work described in the Assessment Plan is conducted. The work consists of three steps:
Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials
determine whether any natural resources have been injured and whether there is a pathway of exposure between the site
of the discharge or release and the injured resources. If trustee officials determine that resources have been injured
and that a pathway of exposure exists, they proceed to the Quantification step. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During Quantification, trustee officials quantify the extent of the resource injuries by measuring the reduction
from baseline conditions. ``Baseline'' conditions are the conditions that would have existed had the discharge
or release not occurred. Resources perform functions for humans and for other resources, such as provision of a food
source, flood control, or provision of recreational opportunities. These functions are known as ``services.''
Reductions from baseline conditions can be measured by evaluating the change in the level of services provided by
the injured resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought as damages
for the quantified natural resource injuries. The basic measure of damages is the cost of restoring, rehabilitating,
replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. The Department's regulations also allow for
an additional component of damages. Trustee officials have the discretion to assess damages for the economic value
of the services lost by the public from the date of the discharge or release until completion of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This value is known as ``compensable value.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a type A procedure is utilized, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage
Determination through the use of a standardized procedure involving minimal field work. The Department is developing
different type A procedures for different environments in stages. Only one type A procedure has been included in the
regulations to date. That type A procedure incorporates a computer model to perform Injury Determination, Quantification,
and Damage Determination for minor discharges or releases in coastal or marine environments. The computer model
is known as the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Coastal and Marine Environments (NRDAM/CME). For more
information on use of a type A procedure during the Assessment Phase, see subpart D of 43 CFR part 11. There are two ongoing
rulemakings concerning type A procedures. The Department is revising the NRDAM/CME in compliance with a court order
and the statutory biennial review requirement. The Department is also developing a new type A computer model for use
in Great Lakes environments. Therefore, the Department does not intend to address the content of the type A procedures
during this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a type A procedure is not applicable, trustee officials use type B procedures instead of a type A procedure. In
some cases, trustee officials may also use type B procedures to supplement damages calculated through use of an applicable
type A procedure. When type B procedures are utilized, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification,
and Damage Determination through the use of site-specific studies. The Department's regulations divide natural
resources into five categories: surface water, ground water, air, geologic, and biological resources. Specific
definitions of injury are provided for each of these categories. The regulations provide guidance on the selection
of testing and sampling methodologies to determine whether an injury has occurred and whether a pathway of exposure
exists. The regulations also provide guidance on measuring the change in baseline conditions during Quantification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the Damage Determination step of an assessment incorporating type B procedures, trustee officials identify
and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring
the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials select one of the possible alternatives based on several
factors. The trustee officials document their decisions in a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan,
which is part of the overall Assessment Plan and, thus, subject to public review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once trustee officials have selected a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative,
they select one or more of the type B cost-estimating methodologies listed in the regulations. The selected methodologies
are used to estimate the cost of implementing the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternative. This estimated cost is the basic measure of damages. Trustee officials also have the discretion to include
compensable value in their damage claim. Compensable value is calculated by applying one or more of the type B economic
valuation methodologies listed in the regulations. For more information on use of type B procedures during the Assessment
Phase, see subpart E of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14283&hyph;87.

D. Post-Assessment Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's regulations cover the entire process that trustee officials need to follow if they file a lawsuit
and expect to obtain a rebuttable presumption. Trustee officials have the authority to settle their damage claims
at any time during the administrative process. However, if the trustee officials do not settle with the PRPs by the
end of the Assessment Phase, then trustee officials prepare a Report of Assessment detailing the results of the Assessment
Phase. Trustee officials present the Report of Assessment to the PRPs along with a demand for damages and assessment
costs. If a PRP does not agree to pay within 60 days, the trustee officials may file suit. Federal and State trustee officials
receive a rebuttable presumption of correctness for assessments performed in accordance with the Preassessment
Phase, Assessment Plan Phase, Assessment Phase, and Post-Assessment Phase procedures set forth in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once damages have been awarded or settlement has been reached, trustee officials establish an account for the recovered
damages and prepare a Restoration Plan for use of the funds. When type B procedures are used, the post-assessment Restoration
Plan is based on the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative selected in the
Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan during the Assessment Phase. For more information on the Post-Assessment
Phase, see subpart F of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14287.

) remanded portions of the administrative process and the type B procedures. 880 F.2d 432 (D.C. Cir. 1989). On March
25, 1994, the Department published a final rule that addressed all but one aspect of the remand. 59 FR 14261. The March
25, 1994, final rule did not address the assessment of lost nonuse values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two potential types of compensable values associated with natural resource injuries: Lost use values and
lost nonuse values. Use values are derived through activities such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent
on use of a resource and include the value of knowing that the resource exists and knowing that a resource will be available
for future generations. The only method available for the express purpose of estimating lost nonuse values is the
contingent valuation methodology (CV). On May 4, 1994, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking
addressing CV as a type B procedure for estimating lost nonuse values. 59 FR 23097. The comment period on the notice
closed on October 7, 1994. 59 FR 32175 (June 22, 1994). The Department does not intend to address the assessment of lost
nonuse values during this review.

IV. Potential Topics for Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During this rulemaking, the Department will be considering ways of revising the administrative process and the type
B procedures to reflect both experience to date in the use of the regulations as well as scientific and technical advances.
The Department solicits comment on all aspects of the administrative process and the type B procedures, other than
the assessment of lost nonuse values. Based on the comments received and its own analysis, the Department will develop
a proposed rule to revise the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has already received numerous comments on the administrative process and type B procedures over the
last few years. One source of comments has been State briefings on use of the regulations. The Department has provided
these briefings to State trustee officials at their request. Another source of comments has been telephone calls
from individuals requesting technical assistance in the application of the regulations to particular cases. Also,
in the course of revising the regulations to comply with

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
rulemaking, the Department has included a discussion of all of those comments in this notice. See 59 FR 14266. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion is intended neither as an exhaustive treatment of all possible topics for review nor as a
definitive indication of the Department's position. Instead, the discussion is simply provided as an aid in generating
further information and analysis. Commenters are encouraged to provide comments not only on the topics discussed
in this notice but also on any other topics relating to the administrative process or type B procedures that they deem
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During this biennial review, the Department will also examine the relationship between its CERCLA damage assessment
regulations and the OPA damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. The Department will consider ways
of clarifying the applicability of its regulations versus NOAA's regulations. In this regard, the Department solicits
comment on what provisions, if any, its regulations should continue to make for assessing damages from oil discharges.
The Department will also coordinate with NOAA to ensure the greatest consistency appropriate between the two sets
of regulations. The Department has noted in the following discussion certain areas where NOAA has proposed an approach
that differs from that currently taken in the Department's regulations. The Department solicits comment on whether
the Department's regulations should be revised to follow the approach proposed by NOAA in areas of difference.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Streamlining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One frequent comment has been that the Department's regulations are ``too wordy'' and ``not in plain English.'' Many
commenters have indicated that the administrative process is too complicated and needs to be streamlined. NOAA's
proposed OPA rule provides for an ``Expedited Damage Assessment'' based on ``limited, focused studies in order to
facilitate restoration as soon as possible.'' 59 FR 1177. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the wide variety of activities involved in assessing damages, the number of legal, scientific, and economic
issues involved in damage assessments, and the broad range of possible types of natural resource damage cases, a certain
level of intricacy is unavoidable in the regulations. However, the administrative process and type B procedures
were designed to provide trustee officials with the flexibility to tailor the scope and level of detail of an assessment
to meet the needs of the particular case. Trustee officials choose from a menu of available type B procedures, using
only those procedures and assessing only those injuries and losses that they deem appropriate and adjusting the level
of documentation accordingly. The regulations allow both for the performance of a limited number of short-term studies
in a simple case involving the release of a single substance affecting a single resource, as well as the performance
of numerous, long-term studies in a complex case of a release of multiple substances affecting multiple resources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Department aims to make the regulations as clear and straightforward as possible. Therefore,
the Department solicits comment on specific aspects of the administrative process that commenters consider unduly
burdensome or complicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Preassessment Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested additional guidance on the conduct of preassessment activities. NOAA has developed
a draft guidance document on preassessment activities under OPA. See 59 FR 1065. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations already contain some guidance on preassessment activities. See 43 CFR &sect;&sect;11.20&hyph;11.25.
The Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility
to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit
to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department
solicits comment on specific aspects of the Preassessment Phase that warrant additional guidance. The Department
also solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance
document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters questioned whether a preassessment screen should be required when a type A procedure is used. During
the preassessment screen, trustee officials determine whether the discharge or release is covered by CWA or CERCLA
and whether they have a reasonable probability of making a successful claim before expending efforts to carry out
a damage assessment. See 43 CFR 11.23(b). This determination appears to be relevant regardless of the substantive
assessment methods ultimately used. Moreover, the determination whether to use a type A procedure, type B procedures,
or both is not made until the Assessment Plan Phase, which follows the performance of the preassessment screen. See
43 CFR 11.33. The Department solicits comment on ways to reduce the burden of the preassessment screen while at the
same time ensuring that trustee officials adequately consider the appropriateness of pursuing a damage claim before
proceeding with either a type A procedure, type B procedures, or both.

3. Coordination With Other Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters requested additional guidance on coordination among trustee agencies and between trustee
agencies and response agencies. Commenters raised questions about the lead authorized official. Some commenters
sought clarification of the role of the lead authorized official. Others requested a prohibition against the designation
of a trustee official who is also a PRP as lead authorized official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suggestions for improved coordination between trustee and response activities included: restricting the time
allowed to conduct an assessment in order to avoid potential conflicts with settlement negotiations between response
agencies and PRPs; requiring trustee officials to participate in the remedial planning process; requiring response
agencies to coordinate with trustee officials; and authorizing the On-Scene Coordinator to contact just one Federal
trustee agency and one State trustee agency and requiring that the contacted trustee agencies notify all other trustee
agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations already provide some guidance on trustee coordination. See 43 CFR 11.32(a)(1). The
regulations also include discussions of coordination with response agencies. 43 CFR 11.23(f) and 11.31(a)(3).
The Department intends to take a close look at these coordination provisions during the biennial review. The Department
encourages commenters to provide suggestions on ways of improving coordination among trustee agencies and between
trustee and response activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes a model memorandum of understanding designed to facilitate trustee coordination.
See 59 FR 1185. Several States have been working to ensure better interagency coordination. Also, as part of the recent
National Performance Review designed to streamline government operations, the Department developed a number of
recommendations concerning the improvement of trustee coordination for natural resource damage assessments.
The Department intends to examine these efforts to see what lessons can be learned.

4. Public and PRP Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters voiced opinions about the opportunity for public and PRP participation in the assessment process.
Some commenters thought that additional opportunities for public input were necessary while others stated that
the existing opportunities for public participation were excessive. Several commenters thought that the Department
should encourage earlier involvement of PRPs in assessments to avoid duplication of effort. NOAA's proposed OPA
rule includes a model memorandum of understanding for trustee officials and PRPs to use when conducting joint assessments.
59 FR 1187. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to public participation, the Department's regulations require that the public be given an opportunity
to review and comment on the Assessment Plan, including the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, as
well as the post-assessment Restoration Plan. See 43 CFR 11.32(c), 11.81(d)(2), and 11.93(a), as amended by 59 FR
14283, and 14287.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to PRP participation, the Department's regulations require that trustee officials provide PRPs with
a Notice of Intent to Perform an Assessment before beginning an assessment and invite the participation of the PRPs.
See 43 CFR 11.32(a)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14282. Trustee officials are also required to make the Assessment Plan available
to PRPs for review and comment. See 43 CFR 11.32(c). Finally, trustee officials are authorized to allow PRPs to perform
assessment work. See 43 CFR 11.32(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determining the appropriate level of public and PRP participation in the natural resource damage assessment process
requires balancing the interests of the public, the PRPs, and the trustee officials. The Department solicits comment
on whether the regulations strike the appropriate balance and, if not, how the regulations could be revised to strike
a more appropriate balance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's regulations are not mandatory but must be followed in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption.
43 CFR 11.10. Some commenters have questioned the decision to make the regulations optional. For example, one commenter
suggested that Federal trustee agencies be required to use the regulations unless all affected trustees agree otherwise.
The Department solicits additional comment on whether to require trustee officials to use the regulations when they
pursue a claim for natural resource damages under CERCLA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. Settlement Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters have requested that the regulations address settlement procedures. For example, when trustee
officials use type B procedures, they must develop a preliminary estimate of damages to help scope the range of work
appropriate during the Assessment Phase. See 43 CFR 11.35(a), as amended by 59 FR 14282. Some commenters have suggested
that trustee officials be encouraged to use the preliminary estimate of damages to initiate settlement discussions.
Other commenters have suggested that trustee officials be encouraged to perform separate assessments for each affected
resource to facilitate settlement. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes guidance on settlement procedures. 59 FR 1171.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department strongly supports and encourages the use of the regulations as a framework for negotiated resolutions
of natural resource damage claims. The Department is concerned that establishment of specific settlement procedures
in the regulations might unduly restrict the flexibility of negotiating parties. However, the Department solicits
comment on the need for and possible nature of settlement guidance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Assessment Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There have been several comments about the Assessment Plan. The regulations require trustee officials to develop
a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) plan that satisfies the requirements listed in guidance developed
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), if that guidance is applicable. See 43 CFR 11.31(c)(2), as amended
by 59 FR 14281. Some commenters thought that the reference to EPA guidance was inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that EPA's QA/QC guidance is a well-established standard. Moreover, the Department's regulations
provide that EPA guidance need only be followed if applicable. The Department solicits comment on specific areas
of concern with EPA's QA/QC guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters questioned whether the requirement that the Assessment Plan include information on sampling size,
design, and location and estimated recovery period was necessary. One commenter stated that the Assessment Plan
should include a summary of the nature and extent of contamination to ensure that the approach used to assess damages
is commensurate with the potential impact on resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Assessment Plan is to provide the public with a description of, and to organize, the work that will
be performed during the Assessment Phase. Inclusion of information about sampling size, design, and location and
estimated recovery periods seems appropriate to fulfill that purpose. On the other hand, since a natural resource
damage assessment focuses on the actual injuries to resources rather than the level of chemical present, inclusion
of information about the nature and extent of contamination may not be essential. However, the Department solicits
additional comment on the appropriate scope and level of detail of the Assessment Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that the Department should take precautions to ensure that trustee officials do not undertake
basic research when performing damage assessments. These commenters suggested that the Department provide a list
of sources of existing scientific data and prohibit trustee officials from performing new research unless there
are no existing data regarding the effect of the particular substance on the particular natural resources involved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that trustee officials should not undertake unnecessary basic research and one of the purposes
of requiring a publicly available Assessment Plan is to protect against such research. A master list of existing data
sources across the full range of potentially affected resources would be costly and time-consuming to compile, virtually
impossible to keep up to date, and might also stifle development of new approaches. However, the Department solicits
comment on alternative ways of guarding against the performance of unnecessary basic research.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters sought additional guidance on post-assessment activities. The Department's regulations already
provide some guidance on post-assessment activities. See 43 CFR 11.90&hyph;11.93, as amended by 59 FR 14287. The
Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility
to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit
to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department
solicits comment on specific aspects of the Post-assessment Phase that warrant additional guidance. The Department
also solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance
document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters have sought additional clarification of the requirements related to the establishment of a restoration
account for recovered damages. One commenter thought that the regulations should require trustee officials to hold
any collected damages in interest-bearing accounts. Other commenters have asked whether joint damage recoveries
by co-trustee agencies can be placed in a single restoration account. Trustee officials' authority to open various
forms of accounts is determined by applicable Federal, State, and tribal fiscal law. Therefore, although nothing
in the Department's regulations prevents trustee officials from placing damage recoveries in an interest-bearing
account, the regulations do not require trustee officials to do so. Instead, the regulations provide that when trustee
officials do not have the authority to place damage recoveries in an interest-bearing account, they should adjust
their damage claim to account for inflation. 43 CFR 11.92(b), as amended by 59 FR 14287. Also, the regulations neither
prohibit nor require the opening of joint accounts. The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification
of the appropriate form of restoration accounts should be provided.

9. Assessment Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters sought additional clarification on the scope of recoverable assessment costs. CERCLA provides
that trustee officials may only recover ``reasonable'' assessment costs. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). The Department's
regulations include a definition of ``reasonable cost.'' See 43 CFR 11.14(ee). Among other things, this definition
requires that the anticipated cost of the assessment be expected to be less than the anticipated damage amount. Some
commenters have stated that this definition should be revised so that the reasonableness of assessment costs is determined
by comparing the cost of each component of the assessment to the anticipated damages to be determined by that component.
NOAA's proposed OPA rule defines ``reasonable cost of an assessment'' as those costs incurred in performing an assessment
in accordance with the OPA rule. 59 FR 1169. The Department solicits comment on whether any revision of its definition
of ``reasonable cost'' is appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's regulations provide that trustee officials may recover the ``reasonable and necessary'' costs
of an assessment. See 43 CFR 11.15(a)(3)(ii), as amended by 59 FR 14281. Some commenters have questioned whether this
provision would require trustee officials to demonstrate not only that their assessment costs were reasonable but
also that they were necessary. These commenters noted that CERCLA merely requires trustee officials to demonstrate
that their assessment costs were reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference to ``necessary'' assessment costs was not intended to require trustee officials to make an additional
demonstration beyond that required by CERCLA. Therefore, the Department is considering deleting the reference
to ``necessary'' assessment costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations provide examples of recoverable assessment costs. See 43 CFR 11.15(a)(3)(ii), as
amended by 59 FR 14281. Some commenters have suggested that the regulations be amended to include a list of specific
practices that would render assessment costs unreasonable. The Department questions whether addition of such a
list would be workable or necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned whether attorneys' fees were recoverable assessment costs. The Department believes
that trustee officials will generally need the assistance of an interdisciplinary team of experts when performing
natural resource damage assessments. The regulations do not restrict recoverable assessment costs to the expenses
of particular types of professionals. The Department's regulations provide that recoverable assessment costs
are ``limited to those costs incurred or anticipated by the authorized official for, and specifically allocable
to, site-specific efforts taken in the assessment of damages.'' 43 CFR 11.60(d)(2). Therefore, if attorneys are
involved in work specifically allocable to an assessment, the resulting attorneys' fees are recoverable as assessment
costs under the regulations. The Department solicits comment on whether additional guidance on the recoverability
of attorneys' fees is warranted.

B. Injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters have indicated that the injury definitions contained in the Department's regulations should be
relaxed. Several commenters thought that trustee officials should be allowed to document injury by measuring the
mere presence of the oil or hazardous substance in a natural resource. Other commenters have felt that the Department
should allow injury to be documented through a risk analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, some commenters have advocated the development of more restrictive injury definitions. Several
commenters have contended that trustee officials should be required to link the specific substance found in a natural
resource to that of the discharge or release in question. Other commenters have suggested that injuries should be
limited to lost public uses of the natural resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations establish acceptance criteria for the development of biological injury definitions. 43 CFR 11.62(f)(2).
Some commenters have stated that these criteria should be applied not only when a new injury definition is developed
but also each time trustee officials document incident-specific injuries under existing injury definitions. Others
felt that the acceptance criteria should be applied to each hazardous substance for which a particular biological
injury definition was to apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has proposed standards for determining injury under OPA that differ from those in the Department's regulations.
See 59 FR 1178&hyph;1180. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to carefully examine the type B standards and methods for determining injury during this review.
The Department encourages commenters to provide suggestions on injury determination and quantification.

C. Economics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Compensable Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters sought clarification on the economic values that are included in compensable value. Some commenters
questioned when lost economic rent constitutes a compensable value. The Department's regulations provide that
compensable value includes ``any economic rent accruing to a private party because the Federal or State agency or
Indian tribe does not charge a fee or price for the use of the resources.'' 43 CFR 11.83(c)(1), as amended by 59 FR 14286.
The Department's regulations also provide that compensable value includes changes in consumer surplus. Some commenters
requested clarification of what constituted consumer surplus. The Department solicits comment on whether the regulations
should provide additional guidance on the assessment of damages for lost economic rent and consumer surplus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A couple of commenters stated that compensable value should include not only the value of services lost to humans but
also the value of services lost to other resources as a result of the injuries. Under the Department's regulations,
trustee officials may consider not only the reduction in services to humans but also the reduction in services to other
resources when selecting appropriate restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition measures
and estimating their costs. However, compensable value may be calculated only for the resource services lost to the
public pending completion of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.
See 43 CFR 11.83(c)(1), as amended by 59 FR 14286. The Department notes that compensable value does account indirectly
for certain services lost to other resources. For example, compensable value for lost fishing opportunities may
reflect the results of food web losses. If commenters think that additional values should be included in compensable
value, they should specify the values of interest, explain the legal basis for including such values, and provide
specific suggestions on how those values should be measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations provide that in assessments where the scope of economic analysis is at the State level,
only the compensable value to the State should be counted. 43 CFR 11.84(h)(3), as amended by 59 FR 14287. Several commenters
suggested that this provision be revised to allow State trustee officials to assess and recover compensable value
for all individuals, not just those within the State. The Department solicits comment on the appropriate scope of
economic analysis for all trustee officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Guidance on Methodologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were numerous requests for additional guidance on implementation of the cost-estimating and valuation methodologies
listed in the regulations. With regard to cost-estimating methodologies, some commenters have stated that the guidance
provided on the incorporation of uncertainty into cost estimates is inadequate. See 43 CFR &sect;11.84(d), as amended
by 59 FR 14286&hyph;87. Other commenters requested additional guidance on selection and use of cost-estimating
methodologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to valuation methodologies, commenters raised concerns about the possibility of double counting if
a hedonic pricing methodology is used. One commenter noted that the regulations state, ``When regional travel cost
models exist, they may be used if appropriate.'' 43 CFR 11.83(c)(2)(iv), as amended by 59 FR 14286. This commenter
stated that this statement incorrectly implied that regional cost models were more appropriate than other models.
Another commenter stated that use of the travel cost methodology should not be allowed because the results of a travel
cost model can be skewed by the actions of one unusually avid traveler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department solicits comment on the need for and possible content of guidance on implementation of cost-estimating
methodologies. The Department also solicits comment on the need for and possible content of guidance on implementation
of methodologies for valuing lost use values. Commenters should restrict their remarks to the calculation of lost
use values, because, as noted above, the Department is addressing the estimation of lost nonuse values in a separate
rulemaking. See 59 FR 23097. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Willingness to Accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that trustee officials be allowed to calculate compensable value by estimating the
minimum amount of money an individual would require once an injury occurred in order to be as well off as before the injury
occurred (willingness to accept). The Department agrees that, since natural resources are held in trust for the public,
willingness to accept is the correct theoretical measure of compensable value. However, because of the practical
difficulties entailed in reliably measuring willingness to accept, the Department's regulations require the use
of methodologies that measure the amount of money an individual would be willing to pay to prevent a natural resource
injury (willingness to pay). 43 CFR 11.83(c)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14286. The Department solicits comment on whether
reliable methods exist for measuring willingness to accept. The Department also solicits comment on the conditions
under which willingness to accept rather than willingness to pay would, in theory, result in significantly different
estimates of compensable value.

4. Discount Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's regulations provide that trustee officials should discount the value of future costs and losses
using the discount rate specified in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;94 (OMB Circular A&hyph;94),
dated March 27, 1972, which was ten percent. 43 CFR 11.84(e)(2). OMB Circular A&hyph;94 has been revised. The current
version, dated October 29, 1992, indicates that the discount rate for public investment is 7 percent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is soliciting comment on whether use of a seven percent discount rate (the current value in Circular
A&hyph;94) is appropriate or whether trustee officials should be allowed to use a different discount rate. A possible
alternative discount rate for future public losses of natural resources is the consumer rate of time preference,
which is the rate of interest at which an individual would be indifferent between consuming goods now and postponing
consumption to a later date. Interest rates on investments with little or no default risk, such as U.S. Treasury bonds,
provide an estimate of the consumer rate of time preference. The Department solicits comment on whether trustee officials
should be allowed to use a discount rate based on the U.S. Treasury borrowing rate on marketable securities with maturities
comparable to the period over which future losses will occur. Such an approach would be consistent with that proposed
by NOAA under OPA. See 59 FR 1184. Information on U.S. Treasury borrowing rates on marketable securities is provided
in Appendix C of OMB Circular A&hyph;94.

5. Cost-Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's regulations define ``cost-effectiveness'' to mean that ``when two or more activities provide
the same or a similar level of benefits, the least costly activity providing that level of benefits will be selected.''
43 CFR &sect;11.14(j). Commenters have expressed confusion over the difference between cost effectiveness and
maximization of net benefits. Consideration of cost effectiveness involves comparing activities that provide
the same or a similar level of benefits. In contrast, consideration of net benefits can be used to compare activities
that provide substantially different levels of benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that the definition of ``cost-effectiveness'' should be changed to delete the reference
to ``similar'' levels of benefits, in order to ensure full restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the phrase ``same or similar'' was not intended to force trustee officials into using methods that produce lower
benefits. Instead, the term merely reflects the fact that in the damage assessment context trustee officials will
often be comparing methods that do not produce exactly the same benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification is warranted.

D. Legal Topics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Judicial Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One significant area of discussion has been judicial review of damage assessments. CERCLA provides that any determination
or assessment of damages performed ``in accordance with'' the natural resource damage assessment regulations ``shall
have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption on behalf of the trustee.'' CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). This provision
is incorporated into the Department's regulations without further clarification. See 43 CFR &sect;11.91(c). Commenters
have asked the Department to define the term ``rebuttable presumption'' and clarify when and to which aspects of the
assessment the rebuttable presumption applies. Some commenters have questioned whether the phrase ``in accordance
with'' the regulations allows trustee officials to obtain a rebuttable presumption for any portion of an assessment
that complies with the regulations or whether it restricts the rebuttable presumption to those assessments that
follow all portions of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations provide both an administrative process for development and review of documentation
as well as a range of alternative methodologies for the actual determination of injuries and damages. The Department
believes that in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption, a trustee official must follow the entire administrative
process set forth in the regulations. If the trustee official has followed the administrative process, the rebuttable
presumption attaches to those components of the damage claim that were calculated through the appropriate use of
any of the methodologies described in the regulations. However, trustee officials are not required to use all of the
listed methodologies in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption. The Department solicits comment on this interpretation
and on whether additional clarification of the effect of the rebuttable presumption is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been comments about whether judicial review of an assessment should be limited to an administrative record.
Under NOAA's proposed OPA rule, judicial review of assessment costs and estimated costs of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources would be conducted on an administrative record. 59 FR 1185.
The Department solicits comment on whether a similar provision should be included in its regulations. The Department
also solicits comment on whether judicial review of compensable value should be conducted on an administrative record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Effect of Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters have expressed confusion over the applicability of amendments of the natural resource damage assessment
regulations to ongoing damage assessments that were started before the amendments became effective. The Department
solicits comment on whether it should clarify that trustee officials are entitled to a rebuttable presumption so
long as their assessments are in accordance with the regulations as they were in effect at the time that the assessments
began.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters have sought clarification of various statutory limitations on liability, including the ceilings
set forth in section 107(c) of CERCLA and the provision in section 107(f)(1) that excludes natural resource damages
if those damages and the release that caused those damages occurred wholly before the enactment of CERCLA. The Department's
regulations incorporate the statutory limitations on liability but do not provide any clarification of those limitations.
43 CFR 11.15(b) and 11.24(b)(1). The Department will consider the development of additional guidance if commenters
identify specific areas of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Double Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters have sought clarification of the prohibition against ``double recovery'' of damages contained
in section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA. The Department's regulations incorporate this prohibition. 43 CFR &sect;&sect;11.15(d)
and 11.84(c). Double recovery refers to the recovery of two or more damage amounts to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
and/or acquire the equivalent of the same injured resource or lost service or to compensate for the same lost public
value. The Department will consider the development of additional guidance if commenters identify specific areas
of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Threatened Releases and Discharges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another area of discussion has been the recovery of natural resource damages caused by the threat of a release or discharge.
Section 107(a)(4) of CERCLA refers to liability for ``a release or a threatened release.'' However, section 107(a)(4)(C)
refers to damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources ``resulting from such a release.'' Also,
section 301(c) of CERCLA authorizes the Department to develop regulations for assessment of ``damages for injury
to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a release of oil or a hazardous substance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations address only damages resulting from an actual release or discharge. NOAA's proposed
rule, relying on section 1002(a) of OPA, would allow for the assessment of diminished use of a resource resulting from
the threat of a discharge. 59 FR 1169. The Department solicits comment on whether CERCLA allows for recovery of damages
resulting from a threatened release and whether the Department's regulations should be revised to allow for the assessment
of damages resulting from a threatened release or discharge. The Department also solicits examples of the types of
damages that might be assessed in the case of a threatened discharge or release.

6. Archaeological and Cultural Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters have questioned whether CERCLA authorizes the recovery of damages for injury of archaeological
and cultural resources. The Department believes that ``archaeological'' and ``cultural'' resources do not constitute
``natural resources'' as defined by CERCLA. However, the Department's regulations do permit trustee officials
to include the loss of archaeological and cultural services provided by a natural resource in a natural resource damage
assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Unused Damage Awards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters have suggested that the statutory requirement that damages be spent to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured resources dictates that any sums not used in this manner be returned to
the PRPs. The Department's regulations provide that collected damages may only be used to fund actions described
in the Restoration Plan and do not address the disposition of any ``excess'' funds. See 43 CFR 11.92(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that CERCLA requires all collected damages to be spent on restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, which includes mitigation of the public loss of services during the
recovery period. Therefore, all funds should be used for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources.

8. NEPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters sought clarification of whether the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) applies to assessments
or restorations performed in accordance with the regulations. The Department does not anticipate addressing the
applicability of NEPA in the damage assessment regulations. However, the Department believes that the information
needed for the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan should fulfill the requirements of NEPA, with equivalent
opportunities for public input. Thus if NEPA were applicable to an assessment or restoration activity, the Department
believes that appropriate and timely information would be available.

9. Consideration of Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that the Department's regulations should be revised to require trustee officials to offset
any damages resulting from the discharge or release with any benefits produced by the discharge or release. The Department
solicits additional comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Tribal Trustees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters have sought to ensure that the interests of tribal entities are adequately addressed in the
Department's regulations. A number of commenters expressed concern over the treatment of tribal values, including
the values associated with tribal cultural resources. As noted above, the Department believes that ``cultural''
resources, including tribal cultural resources, do not constitute ``natural resources'' as defined by CERCLA.
However, the Department's regulations do permit trustee officials to include the loss of cultural services provided
by a natural resource in a natural resource damage assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters suggested that the Department's fiduciary responsibility to Indian tribes extends to financing
natural resource damage assessments involving tribal resources. Although the Department exercises a fiduciary
responsibility as trustee for Indian resources, the Department believes that discussion of funding mechanisms
for damage assessment activities conducted by Indian tribes is not appropriate for this rulemaking, except as addressed
in the law and regulation regarding the liability of PRPs and use of recovered sums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that CERCLA grants a rebuttable presumption to assessments performed by tribal trustee officials.
This commenter stated that when CERCLA was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), Congress
intended to grant tribes the same authority as States in the area of natural resource trustee activities. The commenter
further noted that under established case law concerning the Federal government's fiduciary responsibility to
tribes, any ambiguity in the statute concerning tribes' right to the rebuttable presumption must be construed in
favor of the tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that the regulations were revised in 1988 to reflect the SARA amendment to CERCLA granting a rebuttable
presumption to natural resource damage assessments performed by State trustee officials. See 43 CFR 11.91(c). At
that time and in subsequent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, the Department has taken the position that SARA did not extend the rebuttable presumption to assessments
performed by tribal trustee officials and that granting a rebuttable presumption to tribes will require a legislative
change.

1. Types of Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters have suggested that the regulations should encourage trustee officials to select restoration and
rehabilitation alternatives rather than replacement or acquisition alternatives. The Department's regulations
do not indicate a preference for any particular type of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition
alternative. The Department solicits comment on whether it has the authority, and whether it is appropriate, to develop
and require adherence to a priority system for selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations provide that Federal trustee officials may not select an alternative that requires
acquisition of land for Federal management, unless restoration, rehabilitation and replacement are not possible.
43 CFR 11.82(e), as amended by 59 FR 14285. Some commenters supported this restriction and requested that it be extended
to State and tribal natural resource trustees. Other commenters thought that the restriction should be eliminated
altogether. The Department is interested in comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that the regulations should clearly authorize trustee officials to choose a natural recovery
alternative when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. The
Department believes that the regulations already authorize trustee officials to select a natural recovery alternative
when appropriate. The Department's regulations explicitly require trustee officials to consider a ``No Action-Natural
Recovery'' alternative. 43 CFR 11.82(c)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14284.

2. Guidance on Selection of an Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters have requested guidance on selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition alternative. In particular, some commenters thought that the Department should provide guidance on
how trustee officials could maximize the opportunities for natural recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations already provide some guidance on the selection of a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. See 43 CFR 11.82, as amended by 59 FR 14284&hyph;85. The Department's
regulations require trustee officials to evaluate a reasonable number of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition alternatives, including natural recovery. The Department's regulations also provide a number
of factors that trustee officials must consider when selecting an alternative. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes
a similar list of factors and contains guidance on determining when to select an alternative that relies on natural
recovery. 59 FR 1181. NOAA has developed a draft guidance document on restoration activities. 59 FR 1065. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility
to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit
to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department
solicits comment on specific aspects of the selection process that warrant additional guidance. The Department
solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance document.
The Department also intends to consider the appropriateness of offering guidance on available restoration and rehabilitation
techniques and would appreciate information on appropriate case studies demonstrating successful application
of restoration and rehabilitation measures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Department's regulations, one of the factors that trustee officials must consider when selecting a restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative is the relationship between estimated costs and
estimated benefits. 43 CFR 11.82(d)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14285. Total damages will depend on the sum of compensable
value and restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. Often there will be tradeoffs between
compensable value and restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. For example, a fast-paced
restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative may result in a lower level of interim
lost use, and thus reduce associated compensable values. However, implementation of such an alternative may result
in significantly higher restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. In some cases, there
may be sufficient data to demonstrate that some restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternatives result in substantially lower total damages than others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has solicited comment on whether, under OPA, trustee officials should be required to explain their rationale
if they select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that does not minimize
total damages. 59 FR 1134. The Department solicits comment on whether a similar requirement should be added to the
Department's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that socioeconomic effects of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternatives might be added to the list of factors that trustee officials are to consider in making their selection
among alternatives. The Department's regulations provide that trustee officials may consider all relevant considerations
when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. 43 CFR 11.82(d),
as amended by 59 FR 14284&hyph;85. Therefore, trustee officials already have the ability to consider socioeconomic
effects if relevant.

4. Services Versus Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed confusion over whether the Department intended restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of the equivalent to be measured in terms of the services provided by a resource, the resource itself,
or both. Several commenters noted apparent inconsistencies in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent should
be strictly limited to the services provided by the resource. For example, some commenters believed that if an injured
stream was used for fishing and nothing else, PRPs should only be liable for the cost of cleaning that stream to the point
where fishing opportunities are returned to baseline. These commenters thought that requiring restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent of both services and the resource itself would create economic
inefficiencies and would constitute double counting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters indicated that measuring restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the
equivalent in terms of services only would fail to fully compensate the public. These commenters expressed concern
that using services alone as a measurement could prevent trustee officials from attaining complete restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to carefully review the use of the terms ``resources'' and ``services'' in this biennial review.
The Department solicits comment on whether restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition should
be measured in terms of services, resources, or both. The Department also solicits comment on the definition of ``services''
and whether it should be modified or additional concepts should be developed or defined to further clarify this issue.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Committed Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the concept of committed use should not apply to restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, in the sense that restoration of a resource or service to a level of environmental
quality beyond that needed to support existing committed uses should not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Committed use'' is defined as a current or planned public use for which there is a documented commitment established.
43 CFR 11.14(h). Under the Department's regulations, the concept of committed use applies only to the calculation
of compensable value and does not affect the appropriate level of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition of equivalent resources. See 43 CFR 11.84(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committed use requirement was designed to prevent trustee officials from assessing compensable value for purely
speculative uses of a resource. When measuring restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition,
the guiding concept is whether baseline conditions have been reestablished, irrespective of consideration of compensable
values. Failure to account for potential services when measuring restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition of equivalent resources could violate

resource has no documented ``committed use.'' 880 F.2d at 462.

6. Implementation of an Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter said there should be provisions for starting restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
activities while the damage assessment is still under way. The Department's regulations provide for implementation
of emergency restorations in appropriate circumstances, generally limited to actions necessary to abate an emergency
situation. 43 CFR 11.21. Other than for emergency restorations, starting restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition activities while damage assessment is underway, while not precluded, is not expressly discussed
in the regulations. However, trustee officials may not expend funds received for restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources prior to developing a Restoration Plan and making it available
for public comment and review. 43 CFR 11.92(c); CERCLA sec. 111(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment process is designed, in part, to ensure that appropriate and efficient measures to accomplish restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources are adopted. Unless there is a compelling
reason for early initiation of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition activities, the
Department believes that the administrative process established under the regulations should be followed. This
approach is similar to that provided under other existing legislation and regulation (e.g., NEPA and the Administrative
Procedure Act) whereby there are general and specific constraints on taking certain actions or making irrevocable
decisions or irretrievable commitments of resources prior to completion of appropriate planning and public involvement.
However, if initiation of certain restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition actions would
not constrain decisionmaking following completion of the assessment process, and if the public was given adequate
opportunity to comment on the proposed actions consistent with CERCLA section 111(i), such actions could be appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters have also sought clarification of 43 CFR 11.21 (b) and (c), which provide that a trustee official may undertake
emergency restoration actions ``consistent with its existing authority.'' Existing 43 CFR 11.21 was developed
in recognition of section 111(i) of CERCLA, which provides that trustee officials need not develop a restoration
plan subject to public comment prior to taking emergency actions. The Department does not believe that section 111(i)
of CERCLA provides trustee agencies with independent authority to take action they would not otherwise have authority
to take. The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked the Department to recognize the right of co-trustees to spend collected damages on implementation
of different Restoration Plans. While the Department's regulations require trustee coordination and encourage
joint development and implementation of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition actions,
nothing in the regulations prohibits co-trustees from implementing different Restoration Plans. The Department
solicits further comment on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested guidance on determining when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources is complete. Some commenters suggested that trustee officials provide PRPs with a certification
when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is essentially completed
so that PRPs will not remain liable indefinitely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations provide that the recovery period is the time until baseline conditions have been reestablished.
43 CFR 11.73(a), as amended by 59 FR 14283. It is up to the trustee officials, and in the case of settlements the joint
agreement of the trustee officials and the PRPs, whether a site-specific definition of completeness should be included
in the Restoration Plan. The Department has not considered it necessary to require trustee officials to provide PRPs
with a certification when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources
is essentially completed. The extent of a PRP's continuing liability after damages have been recovered by the trustee
officials depends on the terms of the judgment or settlement agreement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared an environmental assessment
and a finding of no significant impact for the shipment of an unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing.
A risk analysis, which forms the basis for the environmental assessment, has led us to conclude that shipment of the
unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of the
human environment. Based on our finding of no significant impact, we have determined that an environmental impact
statement need not be prepared.

.) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued.
A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In
order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization
from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological product
referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted a risk analysis to assess the product's potential effects on the safety
of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on that risk analysis, APHIS has prepared an environmental
assessment. APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing
will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Based on this finding of no significant impact,
we have determined that there is no need to prepare an environmental impact statement.

<DOCTITLE>Democracy Fellows Program; Announcing Request for Applications </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On or about October 25, 1994 a Request for Applications (RFA) will be issued by the Office of Democracy and Governance
of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The RFA will request cooperative agreement applications for not-for-profit
U.S. NGOs, U.S. PVOs, or U.S. colleges and universities to develop a Democracy Fellows Program. The United States
Agency for International Development will seek to establish a 5 year cooperative agreement. The goal of the program
is to establish a cadre of field experienced technical experts committed to careers in democracy and governance.
The grantee will be required to identify, place, and supervise junior and mid-level experts in assignments that will
contribute to democracy programs in developing countries, as well as to the career development and commitment of
the experts themselves. It is envisioned that the project will include the following activities: (1) Identification
of suitable assignments for Fellows; (2) Recruitment, review and selection of Fellows; (3) Orientation, supervision
and support of Fellows; (4) Counterpart development; and (5) establishment of an Advisory Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested not-for-profit U.S. NGOs, U.S. PVOs, U.S. colleges, and universities, or a consortium thereof, should
send a letter referencing RFA number OP/B/AEP&hyph;95&hyph;001 along with

In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated October 5, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and the Republic
of Turkey, agreement was reached to amend further their Bilateral Textile Agreement, effected by exchange of notes
dated July 29 and August 6, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to establish a 1994 limit for
Category 611 and newly merged Categories 625/626/627/628/629 and to amend the 1994 base level for sublimit 338&hyph;S/339&hyph;S/638&hyph;S/639&hyph;S.
The amended level for 338&hyph;S/339&hyph;S/638&hyph;S/639&hyph;S includes an increase for swing. The current
limits for Categories 350 and 351/651 are being increased by special shift, reducing the limits for Categories 335
and 341/641, respectively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
By a letter dated September 12, 1994, the CME submitted proposed rule amendments pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12)(A)
of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'') and Commission Regulation 1.41(b). The proposed amendments would limit
the permissibility of exchange for physical (``EFP'') transactions for the Eurodollar futures contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, EFP transactions would no longer be permitted for any contract month beyond the second listed
quarterly month in the March quarterly cycle.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such EFP transactions would continue to be permitted for those months not extending beyond the second listed quarterly
month in the March quarterly cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For the Eurodollar futures contract the CME currently lists contract months extending ten years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the proposal's implementation plan, the amendments would be made effective for all applicable contract
months. Thus, under the proposal, the rule amendments would be implemented to apply to existing as well as newly listed
contract months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the CME, the proposal is intended to support liquidity and price-discovery in deferred months of the
Eurodollar futures contract. In this respect, it appears that the proposal at least partially represents a response
to efforts to develop a new method for trading U.S. Treasury securities versus Eurodollar futures contracts (i.e.,
``TED spreads''). This approach involves acquiring both legs of the spread position in a single transaction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission requests comments on any aspect of the CME's proposed rule amendments that members of the public believe
may raise issues under the Act or Commission regulations.

Needs and Uses:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress mandated (FY 1988 DoD Appropriations Act, Section 8071) that CHAMPUS continue the Home Health Care (HHC)
Demonstration. The purpose of this demonstration is to provide beneficiaries with an alternative to hospitalization
and to identify the most cost-effective means for health care coverage to be provided by the government. The collection
instrument requests specific data on impatient costs versus home health care costs. This data is used by Home Health
Care Managers in determining which is more cost-effective. The Act also authorized an expansion of the Home Health
Care Demonstration that permits OCHAMPUS to broaden the criteria for accepting patients, and to include all CHAMPUS
beneficiaries_military retirees and their family members, as well as active duty family members. The Home Health
Care_Case Management Demonstration represents that expansion. Data collected under the demonstration will assist
in developing a coordinated plan of care that meets patients' needs at less cost to the government.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the Delaware River Basin Commission will hold a public hearing on Wednesday, October 26,
1994. The hearing will be part of the Commission's regular business meeting which is open to the public and scheduled
to begin at 1:00 p.m. in the Goddard Conference Room of the Commission's offices at 25 State Police Drive, West Trenton,
New Jersey. The hearing on proposed amendments to the Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges will be held at 3:00
p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An informal conference among the Commissioners and staff will be open for public observation at 10:30 a.m. at the same
location and will include a presentation on New Jersey's management of the Potomac-Raritan-Magothy Aquifer and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Vol. 59, No. 150 p. 39991, that the Commission would hold a public hearing on October 26, 1994 to receive comments on
proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan and Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges concerning the transfer
of Certificates of Entitlement. Holders of Certificates of Entitlement are exempted from the payment of water charges
until such certificates are transferred. The amendments would (1) define ``transfer''; (2) delete two categories
of exemptions from the existing general rule that terminates Certificates of Entitlement upon transfer and (3) revise
a third such category. Commission regulations require upon transfer, the termination of Certificates of Entitlement
which permit the withdrawal of water from the basin without charge. The U.S. Court of Appeals has confirmed the Commission's
power under its Compact to terminate Certificates of Entitlement when a transfer has occurred. The court also ruled
that the Commission's interpretation of its existing regulation that limited the extent to which certain transfers
were exempt from termination was not consistent with the specific wording of the regulations. Pursuant to the court
ruling, the Commission proposes to amend its Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges, so that transfer exceptions
are consistent with existing Commission policy to terminate Certificates of Entitlement when a transfer of ownership
and/or control of a water using facility occurs. The amendments inter alia define a transfer to include the sale of
corporate stock. They also delete existing exceptions to the transfer rule for corporate merger transactions and
certain transactions under the Internal Revenue Code.

 Section 3517 of the Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U. S. C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide interested
Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB may amend
or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal
law, or substantially interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director
of the Information Resources Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection
requests prior to submission of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office,
contains the following: (1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement;
(2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping
burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available
from Patrick J. Sherrill at the address specified above.

Proposed experiments and diagnostic techniques will be evaluated through scientific peer review against predetermined,
published and available criteria. Final selection will be made by the DOE. It is anticipated that multiple grants
will be awarded within available funding. The unique resources of the NLUF are available to scientists for state-of-the-art
experiments primarily in the area of inertial fusion and related plasma physics. Other areas such as spectroscopy
of high ionized atoms, laboratory astrophysics, fundamental physics, materials science, and biology and chemistry
will be considered on a secondary basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LLE was established in 1970 to investigate the interaction of high power lasers with matter. Available at the LLE
for NLUF researchers is the upgraded OMEGA LASER, A 30 Kj uv, 24-beam laser system (at 0.35um) suitable for direct-drive
ICC implosions, and the Glass Development Laser (GDL), a 250 billion watt, single beam prototype for the variety of
experiments including laser-plasma interactions and atomic spectroscopy. The NLUF program for FY95 is to concentrate
on experiments than can be done with the OMEGA laser at the University of Rochester and development of diagnostic techniques
suitable for the upgraded OMEGA system. Measurements of the laser coupling, laser-plasma interactions, core temperature,
and core density are needed to determine the characteristics of the target implosions. Diagnostic techniques could
include either new instrumentation, development of analysis tools, or development of targets that are applicable
for 30 kJ direct-drive implosions. Additional technical information about the facilities and potential collaboration
at NLUF can be obtained from: Dr. James Knauer, Manager, National Laser User's Facility, University of Rochester/LLE,
250 East River Road, Rochester, NY 14623.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed financial assistance award is a grant Washington State to fund an Environmental Technology Partnership
Initiative. The partnership will establish a cooperative approach to: (1) Private sector participation in cleanup
activities at Hanford and other sites, and (2) contributing to local sustainable economic development. The partnership
between DOE and the State of Washington will be designed to accomplish these goals through the application of advanced
technology. The State and DOE will create or designate a non-profit entity to act as a facilitator between governmental
agencies and private partners. This entity will establish connections to academic institutions, industry, and
other research institutions to encourage the development, exchange, and commercialization of environmental technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has determined that award on a noncompetitive basis is appropriate because the recipient is a unit of government
and the activities to be supported are related to the performance of governmental functions within the jurisdiction
of that unit, thereby precluding DOE provision of support of another entity. It has been determined that a grant instrument
is appropriate since the Department of Energy anticipates limited direct involvement with the program.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Department of Energy has developed guidelines for
the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, their reduction, and carbon fixation achieved through any
measure. The data will be reported on forms to be developed by the Energy Information Agency (EIA) and entered into
an EIA database. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidelines provide for the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reductions, and of carbon sequestration.
The guidelines and supporting materials will assist parties in analyzing activities and determining emissions
and reductions in order to voluntarily report this data. The EIA reporting forms will be consistent with the guidelines.
The guidelines and supporting material are finalized and will be available for distribution on or before October
31, 1994.

I. Statutory Authority and Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct; Pub. L. 102&hyph;486), the Secretary of Energy with
the Energy Information Administration, and in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is
required to establish a voluntary reporting system and database on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), reductions
of these gases, and carbon fixation. DOE is required to publish, after public comment, guidelines setting procedures
for the accurate voluntary reporting of information on: (1) Greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis for the baseline
period 1987 through 1990, and for subsequent calendar years; (2) annual reductions of greenhouse gases and carbon
fixation achieved through any measure; and (3) reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved voluntarily, or
as a result of plant or facility closings, or as a result of State or Federal requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines and supporting materials finalized today will assist those who wish to participate in determining
or developing information capable of being reported. The reporting forms and database system required under Section
1605(b) are to be developed by EIA and must be consistent with the guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Draft guidelines and supporting materials were made available for public comment on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28345); that
notice discusses the draft guidelines. A public hearing on the draft guidelines was held on June 29, 1994. The draft
supporting document for the agricultural sector was made available June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33733). Comments were provided
by individuals and associations representing: public interest environmental and land use groups; investor-owned
and publicly-owned utilities; independent power producers; oil production and use; coal production and use; motor
vehicle manufacturing and use; chemical manufacturing; and academic, commercial, and public interest forestry
interests.

revised as discussed below, and now appears as Appendix E to each supporting volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Purpose of the Guidelines and Design Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final guidelines and supporting materials have been developed to reflect the goal of maximizing participation
without compromising the usefulness of the data voluntarily submitted. Commenters on the draft guidelines generally
supported the appropriateness of this goal, although some did not agree on how to strike a balance between maximizing
participation and establishing a meaningful data reporting system. The flexibility provided by the draft guidelines,
which takes into account the reporter's ability to use existing information and select appropriate quantification
methods, was supported by many commenters as necessary to encourage participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some comments from environmental public interest groups and forestry public interest groups urged that
the final guidelines include requirements for verification of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration data.
These commenters believe that the flexibility provided by the program made data verification essential to the credibility
of the information entered into the database. Many of these comments acknowledged that the statute directed neither
DOE nor reporters to obtain verification of data reported, but suggested that third party verification could provide
users of the database with better assurances of its accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of these commenters indicated that, in the alternative, the program should direct reporters to indicate the
basis for the data submitted based on a categorization system, and that the database should be designed to allow sorting
of data on the basis of this categorization. For example, a report would indicate that data was based on measurement,
estimation, or use of default tables, and whether emissions reductions project reports were accompanied by historic
or entity-wide emissions data. A database user would be able to retrieve reported data on the basis of these categories.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide the flexibility necessary to encourage reporting, the guidelines do not provide prescriptive
features such as verification. Rather, the guidelines indicate that a reporter will be asked to categorize the data
submitted. This categorization will include third party verification as well as whether the data was measured or
estimated. Segregation of data by categories will be possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believes the approach of requesting the identification of data derivation, and of any data verification performed,
accommodates both the need to maximize participation by providing flexibility, and the need to create a useful and
accessible database.

C. Changes to Draft Guidelines for Final Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the comments received, DOE revised several provisions of the draft general guidelines and some provisions
of the sector-specific supporting documents. The changes to the draft guidelines include: the addition of gases
to the list of those reportable under the program, with delayed implementation for some of those gases not covered
in the draft guidelines; a limitation on reporting project activities to those that achieved new emission reductions
or carbon sequestration beginning with January 1, 1991; revision of the discussions about distinctions between
primary and secondary effects, and between direct and indirect emissions; and guidance on amending a previous year's
report.

A discussion of responses to significant comments on issues in the draft general guidelines appears below. Significant
changes as a result of comments received on the sector-specific documents are discussed below by sector document.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Gases Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislation does not define ``greenhouse gases.'' The draft guidelines covered emissions of carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous oxide, as well as many of the halogenated substances. The final guidelines add two halogenated substances,
halon 1211 and halon 2402, to the list of gases and substances covered. In addition, DOE announces the delayed addition
of three greenhouse gases, nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide, to the reporting program
starting with the third reporting cycle of the program which is expected in 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Additional Gases to be Covered_Conventional Pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the gases and substances covered by the draft guidelines supported expansion of the program to a more comprehensive
list of greenhouse gases, especially some conventional, or ``criteria,'' pollutants regulated under the Clean
Air Act for which emissions data is collected by EPA and State agencies under various air quality programs. These gases
are nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. Although these gases are not direct greenhouse
gases, they contribute to the formation of carbon dioxide and/or tropospheric ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The international scientific community has been unable to quantify the differential radiative activity of these
gases, and thus has not provided an index of the climate change effects of these gases relative to carbon dioxide. Because
emissions data reported under the program will be reported in units of weight, and not reduced by any common index of
comparative radiative effects, it is unnecessary to exclude gases from the program solely on the basis that a quantification
of comparative effects is not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE agrees that a more comprehensive 1605(b) reporting program should cover these indirect gases, and has expanded
the gases covered by the voluntary reporting program to include nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon
monoxide. However, for the reasons discussed below, DOE is delaying the programmatic acceptance of voluntarily
reported data on emissions and emissions reductions of these gases for a period of two years. Thus, reports of data
related to these gases will first be accepted by EIA during the third reporting cycle of the program, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with reports filed in 1997. These reports may include the results of activities beginning January 1, 1991, as well
as historic emissions data on these gases for the period 1987 to 1990.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary reason for delaying the addition of these gases is to aid in the efficient administration of this new program.
Neither DOE nor EIA has sufficient experience in voluntary reporting to predict the volume of participation in this
program or the difficulties that may arise in its implementation. EIA expects that experience gained in the first
two years of the program will enhance its ability to smoothly accommodate this expansion of the reporting program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Additional Gases to be Covered_Halogenated Substances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were also received on the list of halogenated substances for which emissions and reductions will be reportable.
In response to these comments, the final guidelines add two halogenated substances, halon 1211 and halon 2402, to
the list of reportable gases. Given the limited amount of reporting anticipated on these substances, initial coverage
of the program includes these gases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the June 1994 notice of availability for the draft guidelines, the inclusion of some halogenated substances
in the voluntary reporting program is based on the language of Section 1605(b)(1)(B), referring to the reportability
of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved through ``chlorofluorocarbon capture and replacement.'' Without
this language, DOE might have limited the voluntary reporting program to those gases covered by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, thus excluding the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halogenated substances,
including the two halons now covered, from the reporting program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment noted that the draft guidelines' failure to list halon 1211 and halon 2402 as reportable gases was inconsistent
with the listing of halon 1301. The draft guidelines and supporting materials listed only those halogenated substances
for which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had published an index of global warming potential
(GWP) relative to carbon dioxide. While there are internationally accepted indices of stratospheric ozone depletion
potential for halogenated and bromide substances in addition to those listed in the draft guidelines and supporting
documents, the IPCC published a GWP for halon 1301, but not for any other halon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on stratospheric ozone depletion characteristics, the halogenated substances are covered by an international
agreement, the Montreal Protocol on Substances Depleting the Stratospheric Ozone, and under U.S. law are regulated
under Title VI of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. These gases are greenhouse gases, although they also have the
antagonistic characteristic of destroying tropospheric ozone, which tends to indirectly produce global cooling.
These antagonistic effects complicate the analysis of their impact on the global climate, and have divided the scientific
community over whether the net effect of some of these gases will be global warming or cooling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This division in the scientific community has made it difficult to determine the quantitative global warming potential
of these gases. Because emissions data reported under the program will be reported in units of weight, and not reduced
to a standard measure by application of a common index of comparative radiative effects, and to be consistent with
the decision discussed above on conventional pollutants, halon 1211 and halon 2401 are added to the list of gases for
which emissions may be reported under the program. Based on the limited amount of activity in production and use of
these substances, and on the similarity in emissions of these substances to other halogenated substances, DOE has
determined that there is no administrative need to delay acceptance of submissions on these gases.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Limitation on Vintage of Reportable Projects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Guidelines include a new section, discussing the limitation on reporting projects which resulted in
a reduction in emissions, but on which activity commenced before 1991. The final guidelines permit reporting as projects
only new (post-1990) emissions reductions and carbon sequestration. Pre-1991 emissions reductions will be reflected
in emissions reporting only. Thus, the results of all emission reduction activities which are first achieved in 1991
are reportable as projects, even if the activity commenced before 1991. For example, in the case of an ongoing demand
side management program, emissions changes arising from energy savings through appliance replacement in 1991 can
be reported as project results, but the effects of appliance replacements before 1991 are not reportable as emissions
reduction projects. Rather, these effects are subsumed in emissions reporting for the baseline period of 1987 through
1990.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft guidelines had no comparable discussion. Some commenters maintained that a time limitation on reportable
emissions reduction projects was necessary, particularly because under the guidelines reporters may separately
report emissions and emissions reductions. These comments indicated that the statutory language of section 1605(b)(1)(A)(i)
providing for 1987 through 1990 as baseline years for emissions reporting implied that emissions reductions reporting
under section 1605(b)(1)(B) was limited to reductions occurring after 1990. Reductions occurring before 1991 would
be reportable only for their effect on emissions reported for the baseline years, rather than separately as emissions
reductions projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the statutory language on reporting emissions reductions is not explicitly tied to any specific year or years,
and the years 1987 through 1990 are referred to as the baseline period, DOE is persuaded that goals of the reporting
program are best served by limiting reports of emission reduction projects to new emissions reductions after 1990.
Many emission reduction projects have multi-year or multi-decade lives; without a time limitation, the database
would include the emissions reductions results of older activities more appropriately reflected within emissions
reporting rather than highlighted separately as emissions reduction projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Direct and Indirect Emissions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reporting program covers activities which directly or indirectly result in greenhouse gas emissions or emissions
reductions. DOE has revised the text of the General Guidelines to clarify the distinction between direct and indirect
emissions in order to assist reporters in identifying the distinction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported limiting the program to submissions of data on direct emissions, and to activities that
directly produce or reduce emissions, in order to provide clarity in the program's database. Other comments supported
the draft's inclusion of activities that indirectly impact greenhouse gas emissions, based on the statutory listing
in Section 1605(b)(1)(B) of activities which indirectly affect, or may indirectly affect, emissions or reductions.
Additionally, many comments evidenced confusion over the draft's discussion of direct and indirect emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE agrees that the statutory listing of activities which indirectly affect emissions, as well as activities that
directly affect emissions, supports the inclusion of both direct and indirect emissions in the reporting program.
DOE also agrees that these concepts are potentially confusing. To assist reporters in identifying direct and indirect
emissions, DOE has revised the text of the General Guidelines. It is apparent from many of the comments that this confusion
was largely created by intertwining the concepts of primary and secondary effects of an activity with the concepts
of resulting direct and indirect emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, DOE has eliminated the distinction between primary and secondary effects of a project, leaving a single
concept of ``effects''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Primary and Secondary Effects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on comments expressing confusion over the concepts and the draft guidance for the inclusion of both primary
and secondary effects in project analysis, the final guidelines have eliminated the distinction. While the concepts
are still presented in Section GG&hyph;5.9, the reporter is urged to consider and report the known and quantifiable
``effects'' of a project without regard to whether they are primary or secondary. To provide additional clarity,
the final guidelines also present examples of different types of effects.

5. Amending a Previous Year's Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final guidelines add a provision which allows reporters to amend any previous year's report. The program will,
for example, accept reports based on estimated and default data, which will be identified as such by the reporter.
(See discussion at II.B., above.) Where a reporter subsequently develops better data, for example through field
measurements or utility-specific emissions factors, the original report may be modified based on information developed
using the later-acquired data. The amended report will include the reason for the revision and a comparison of the
amended report's changes to the original report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary reason for adding this provision is to encourage reporters to develop their own activity-specific data,
without discouraging reporting based on less-specific estimation or default data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Radiative Forcing of Greenhouse Gases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language of Section 1605(b)(1) provides that the reporting guidelines are ``to establish procedures for taking
into account the differential radiative activity and atmospheric lifetimes of each greenhouse gas.'' The draft
guidelines and the supporting materials included as Part 7, ``Global Warming Potentials'' (GWPs), describing the
GWP index developed by the IPCC as a simple method for representing the relative effects on climate resulting from
a unit mass of a greenhouse gas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments unanimously supported DOE's decision to require that emissions data be reported only in units of greenhouse
gases emitted, and not to require reporters to convert these data to the effects of the gases reported relative to carbon
dioxide. The final guidelines continue to direct that reported data will be in units of gas emitted. Commenters expressed
concerns that (1) the concept of GWPs was too complex to be useful to most reporters in developing GHG mitigation options;
(2) the discussion in draft Part 7 of the scientific basis of GWPs was flawed; and (3) use of scientific work not yet formally
adopted by the IPCC was inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, draft Part 7 has been substantially condensed and appears as Appendix E in the two supporting
volumes. The expansion of draft Part 7 to clarify fully the many complex and evolving scientific issues was deemed
outside the scope of the voluntary reporting program. A brief discussion of the concept, together with a chart of the
latest quantitative GWP index developed by the international scientific community, is provided in the Appendix.
The reader/user is referred to other sources for additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE agrees that the scientific concepts involved in GWPs, such as time horizons, carbon cycle models, and integration
time scales, may not be clearly understood by many in the general reporting population. The ongoing improvements
in our understanding of the complex global climate system and analytic models developed are evidenced, as discussed
in the Notice of Inquiry preceding the draft guidelines, by the 1992 revision of the 1990 IPCC report on GWPs. Further,
revisions to the 1992 report have been approved by an IPCC subsidiary body, Working Group I, and will be published later
this year. It is from this anticipated publication that the GWPs provided in the draft and final guidelines are taken.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IPCC, an international body charged with reaching international consensus on the complex scientific matters
in climate change, is supported by the United States. IPCC work will ultimately be a factor in both domestic and international
analyses on climate change mitigation options. It would thus be imprudent for the DOE reporting guidelines to address
differential radiative forcing in a manner inconsistent with the IPCC. The 1994 revisions to the IPCC GWP index have
been approved by Working Group I and are expected to be formally accepted by the full IPCC soon after publication of
the final guidelines. DOE is using this material in advance of its formal acceptance for administrative ease.

7. Editorial and Minor Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to various comments, editorial revisions were made throughout the General Guidelines and the supporting
documents as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case studies and examples. Case studies and examples are provided for the purpose of illustrating the process of project
analysis in light of a reporter's purpose and sector-specific circumstances and conditions. Some commenters suggested
that some of the case studies and examples provided were unrealistic, that they suggest a greater reporting burden
for reporters in some sectors than in others, or that they appear to require the use of certain approaches and methods
for some activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these comments, the following text has been added to all case study and example presentations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This example illustrates only one approach in analyzing a project; your analysis, methods, and calculations will
vary depending on your particular circumstances, the geographic location of the project, and other factors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Examples are intended to provide, in an educational manner, illustrations of various approaches to project and emissions
analysis permitted within the guidelines. They are not intended to imply any additional directions or restrictions
on reporting over and above that provided by the Guidelines. The case studies and examples do, however, suggest to
potential reporters different ways in which existing data and resources may be used to develop a report. The illustrated
cases thus differ in detail based on the stated purpose of the hypothetical reporter for reporting, and the individual
circumstances surrounding the project and the reporter. Consistent with the goal of maximum participation in the
program, the flexibility of the reporting program is not bound by any particular case study or example discussion
on any issue.

Subjective Terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were made that the use in the guidelines and the supporting materials of certain descriptive terms, relative
to a reporter's decisions regarding the data developed and reported, were inappropriate within a voluntary program.
The program's flexibility allows reporters to select among various approaches in developing a report. These selections
do not encompass comparative value of the reporter's activities. No value judgments are intended by the use of subjective
terms in any description of the reporter's choice of approaches. Accordingly, the final guidelines and supporting
materials have been revised to minimize use of these terms, and to better reflect that judgments on the quality of the
data reported are to be made by the reporter and database user, and not by the reporting program. Where these terms remain
in the guidelines and supporting documents, they are intended to reflect differing perspectives of both reporters
and database users on choices permitted by the reporting program.

D. Changes to Draft Sector-Specific Supporting Documents for Final Sector-Specific Documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received on all draft sector specific supporting documents. Revisions to the draft guidelines in response
to comments on less significant technical, mathematical, or editorial errors in the draft sector specific supporting
documents are not individually discussed in this notice, but were considered and addressed where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments fall into several categories of issues, including those that have been addressed in the final General
Guidelines and discussed above in section II.C. of this notice. These categories include: failure to discuss all
emissions reduction or carbon sequestration activities applicable to the sector; criticism of the case studies'
use of unrealistic circumstances; the accuracy, completeness, and degree of conservativeness of default tables;
and the lack of balance among sector documents indicating differing reporting burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program is expressly intended to provide reporters with the flexibility to report on the achievements of all emissions
reduction and carbon sequestration activities. The failure of the draft guidelines and supporting materials to
discuss or list any particular activity does not indicate that its achievements are not reportable under the 1605(b)
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, the final supporting documents add discussions of some additional emissions reduction
and carbon sequestration approaches, and provide more emphasis to some of the approaches discussed in the draft.
Nevertheless, the guidelines and supporting documents are not intended to provide an exclusive list of all activities
that may be reported. The guidelines could not, for example, provide identification and quantification of achievements
from the novel, innovative actions for which the information sharing function of the voluntary reporting program
is paramount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above in C.7., the guidelines and supporting documents use case studies and examples to illustrate the
application of concepts and varied approaches to project analysis and reporting. Reporters are not bound by the particulars
of any presentation. Rather, the guidelines provide reporters the flexibility needed to adapt project analysis
approaches to particular circumstances, including the type of project, the availability of necessary data, and
the purpose for reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, while revisions have been made in many case studies and examples throughout the documents in response to comments
regarding realism, these study examples are not intended to be exhaustive of the range of appropriate approaches
that reporters may develop and use to determine the data to report under this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant comments were received on the accuracy, completeness, and degree of conservativeness of the default
tables provided in the supporting documents. Based on DOE's technical judgment on individual comments, errors have
been corrected. Responses to these comments on specific sector default tables appear below in the discussion of the
relevant sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with the flexibility of the program, reporters are encouraged to use and develop data specific to the project
being reported to accommodate their individual circumstances. The continued inclusion of default tables is, however,
in keeping with the goal of maximum participation, where the wide disparity among potential reporting populations
supports the need to provide some ``lookup'' tables for use at the discretion of the reporter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Default tables, by their nature, may provide an easy way for reporters to estimate the quantity of certain factors
they may need in order to report. By virtue of their ease of use, these tables cannot accommodate all variables involved;
rather, they are based on judgments on appropriate methodologies and available data. In some fields of endeavor,
there is no apparent consensus on methodologies and the quality and quantity of data needed either to develop default
tables or to definitively judge their conservativeness. The default tables provided are, in DOE's judgment, generally
conservative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters asked that DOE add default tables covering additional data quantification areas. While DOE agrees
that the addition of tables in these documents could be helpful to reporters, their development did not warrant a delay
in issuing the final guidelines and supporting documents. In many instances, measurement and other methodologies
are in their relative infancy. DOE expects that data and methodologies will evolve as national and international
interest continue in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon sequestration. Since reporters
are permitted to develop their own data and submit it to the voluntary reporting program, the program itself may aid
in the development of methodologies and the accumulation of data to advance knowledge in these areas. DOE acknowledges
that sector-specific documents appear to differ greatly in the detail with which applicable concepts and approaches
are discussed. This distinction was especially noted in comments on the Electricity Supply Sector, Residential
and Commercial Buildings Sector, Industrial Sector and Forestry Sector documents, expressing concern that the
differences may indicate a higher reporting burden for these sectors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The differences in focus and depth are based primarily on the breadth of technical knowledge of each sector's greenhouse
gas and emissions reduction or carbon sequestration features, including the knowledge held by each sector's population
and the degree to which reporters will have or can develop sufficient data necessary for a report. These differences
in focus and depth do not direct any additional or supplementary requirements for these sectors. Minimum reporting
requirements, set forth in section GG&hyph;6 of the final General Guidelines, are identical for all reporters and
projects, regardless of sector.

1. Electricity Supply
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the revisions discussed above, in response to comments on the draft Electricity Supply Sector document,
the final Electricity Supply Sector document includes more prominent mention of: (1) The possible use of Integrated
Resource Planning data and data development methods; (2) the role of least-cost or other dispatching modes; (3) the
role of hydroelectric power in renewable energy; and (4) emissions reduction projects in electrotechnologies.
The discussion of relevant electrotechnologies has been augmented in the Industrial and Transportation Sector
documents as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received on requiring reporters in this sector to use certain existing Federal or State requirements,
or other existing protocols in developing reporting data. One example of a Federal protocol is the EPA's Conservation
and Verification Protocol, 40 CFR Part 73, which is used in the acid rain program under title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 to determine the distribution of bonus sulfur dioxide allowances based on electricity conservation programs.
Another example under the Federal acid rain program is EPA regulations providing for monitoring or estimating and
reporting carbon dioxide emissions from certain boilers. Many States also have protocols dealing with estimating
energy savings from demand side management (DSM) programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While activities in this sector are characterized by an extensive array of measurement and estimation methodologies
and protocols, many of which are mentioned in the guidelines and supporting documents, DOE does not require their
use for the reporting program. Consistent with the flexibility of the program, reporters may choose to use appropriate
protocols and data developed for other reasons, including compliance with Federal and State requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant revisions to some of the examples for this sector were made in response to comments that the scenarios
and quantification specifics provided were unrealistic. In addition to these revisions, the language of the caveat
discussed in section II.C.7., above, has been added to the presentation of all examples for the purpose of indicating
that the example is meant to illustrate concepts, not to prescribe the use of specific approaches.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the supporting document for the Residential and Commercial Buildings Sector reflect similar concerns
to those raised on the Electricity Supply Sector document. In response to comments, DOE has added discussions of electrotechnologies
specific to this sector and identified additional conservation techniques. DOE has clarified that the ability to
report the results of an activity is not dependent on whether that technology or technique is mentioned in the guidelines
or supporting documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities in this sector are characterized by an array of measurement and estimation methodologies, some of which
are mentioned in the document. Comments were received on requiring reporters to use specific protocols available
for this sector. For the same reasons as discussed in section D.1., above, the guidelines do not prescribe the use of
specific methodologies or protocols for measurement or estimation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Industrial
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to comments, DOE has modified discussions on the appropriate consideration of the obsolescence of equipment
in determining the reference case for reportable projects. Biomass emissions factors have been clarified, and the
distinction between temporary and permanent fuel switching has been eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to other sector-specific documents, the final Industrial Sector supporting document has expanded discussions
of electrotechnologies specific to this sector and identified additional conservation techniques. The ability
to report the results of an activity is not dependent on whether a technology or technique is mentioned in the guidelines
or supporting documents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the general revisions discussed above, DOE has expanded the discussion on electric vehicles in the
Transportation Sector supporting document. Activities in the transportation sector are characterized by an extensive
array of measurement and estimation methodologies, some of which are mentioned in the document. The use of some of
these methodologies is required under various Federal regulatory and funding programs, such as those which regulate
vehicle air pollutant emissions or award highway construction funds. For the reasons discussed above, reporters
are not limited to using these protocols.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Forestry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the Forestry Sector document related to its apparent emphasis on carbon sequestration activity from
new or replacement forestation, together with a corresponding lack of emphasis on forest preservation, forest management,
and urban forestry. The varying treatment of types of carbon sequestration activity is not meant to imply a preference
by DOE, or by the reporting program, for any particular type of forestry activity. It is, rather, based primarily on
the state of the knowledge in these areas of forest carbon sequestration. Similar to other sector documents, reporting
is not limited to the activities discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the limited tree species and associated reference cases provided for standard forestry projects suggested
that the table be expanded to include additional species. These data were developed with the assistance of U.S. Forest
Service staff, and the tables are based on the availability of sufficient information to generalize carbon sequestration
effects of certain activities. While such information is available for the major commercial species which are addressed
in the tables, DOE believes that there is insufficient information available to develop adequate default tables
on other species or reference cases. For additional species and reference cases, as well as for other forestry activities,
the reporter will need to develop specific project data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters stated that field measurements for projects in this sector were particularly essential to assure
the accuracy of the data submitted. Consistent with the flexibility necessary to encourage reporting in this and
all other sectors, the guidelines do not provide prescriptive features such as requiring field measurements. Rather,
the guidelines indicate that a reporter will be asked to categorize the data submitted, including whether it is based
on measurement.

Comments were received on the failure to include any discussion of certain emissions reduction or carbon sequestration
approaches specifically applicable to the agricultural sector. In response to these comments, additional text
has been added on windbreaks and shelterbelts, changes to grazing land, and the production of biomass for fuel. The
failure of the document to address other agricultural activities which affect greenhouse gases or carbon sequestration
is not intended to preclude data submissions on those activities, including energy efficiency improvements.

7. Adjusted Electricity Emissions Factors by State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Substantial and detailed comment was received on the draft Appendix C, ``Adjusted Electricity Emissions by State,''
which appeared in all draft sector supporting documents. After consideration of the comments received, Appendix
C has been revised to employ a simpler methodology and the inclusion of nonutility generation emissions. A summary
of the methodology used for the table appears together with the table in Appendix C. The published data on fuel use and
technologies used are identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments that the draft failed to include nonutility generation, emissions factors for nonutility
generation have been added, together with weighted combined emissions factors for utility and nonutility generation.
Where the reporter utilizing the table knows whether the power is utility or nonutility generated, the appropriate
factor should be used. The combined factor is intended for use when the reporter is unable to make this identification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with the flexibility of the program, reporters are encouraged to use emissions factors specifically applicable
to the project being reported. Where a utility-specific factor is available, for example, it will incorporate actual
fuel mix and dispatching modes which are not differentiated within a State factor provided in Appendix C. The inclusion
of revised Appendix C is in keeping with the programmatic goal of maximum participation, by providing a method for
estimating emissions and reductions when other data are not easily available.

DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria which define
such actions under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, and is therefore not subject to regulatory review. Accordingly,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has informed DOE that no clearance of the guidelines and supporting materials
is required.

Take notice that on October 6, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway), P. O. Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1478,
filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;13&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211(a)(2) of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate facilities
to enable Koch Gateway to serve Koch Gas Services (KGS) under Koch Gateway's ITS Rate Schedule for ultimate delivery
to Atlas Production Services, Inc., (Atlas) in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. Koch Gateway makes such request under
its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;430&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act,
all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Koch Gateway states that Atlas requests revision and addition of metering facilities at an existing
receipt tap to facilitate delivery of natural gas from KGS for gas lift operations. Koch Gateway states that it is authorized
to provide natural gas transportation service to KGS under its transportation agreement for such service dated November
1, 1993. Koch Gateway further states that the service provided to KGS would be interruptible and therefore have no
impact on its curtailment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koch Gateway further states that it will revise and install the facilities in compliance with 18 CFR, Part 157, Subpart
F, and that the proposed activities will not effect Koch Gateway's ability to serve its other existing customers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on October 6, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo,
New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;693&hyph;000 a ``Notice of Withdrawal of Pleading'' seeking to withdraw
its ``Request for Authorization Under the Notice Procedures of &sect;157.205'' which was filed August 1, 1994, in
Docket No. CP94&hyph;693&hyph;000 (prior notice filing). National Fuel states that its Notice of Withdrawal is
filed in compliance with Condition C of the Commission's Order on Rehearing issued in Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;112&hyph;001
and CP88&hyph;94&hyph;009 on September 1, 1994 (68 FERC &para;61,278).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Fuel's prior notice filing involved a request for authorization to construct and operate a new point of delivery
in the town of Grand Island, Erie County, New York to provide service to an existing customer, National fuel Gas Distribution
Corporation (Distribution), under National Fuel's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000.
The prior notice filing was noticed August 4, 1994, and no protests were filed during the notice period which expired
September 19, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its prior notice filing, National Fuel noted that it had previously applied for approval under Section 7(c) of the
Natural Gas Act for the acquisition and construction of certain facilities, including the delivery point described
in the prior notice filing. National Fuel explained that it had received conditional approval of the proposal by order
issued June 1, 1994, in Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;112&hyph;000 and CP88&hyph;94&hyph;008 (67 FERC &para;61,270 (1994)).
National Fuel stated that it was unable to commence acquisition and construction because it could not satisfy all
the conditions included in the June 1 order and therefore it had filed for rehearing of the June 1 order. National Fuel
asserted that it urgently needed to commence construction of the Grand Island station in order to have the station
in operation by November 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Fuel has now accepted the certificate issued in Docket No. CP94&hyph;112&hyph;000, et al., in the June 1
order, as amended by the Commission's September 1, 1994, order on rehearing. However, Paragraph (C) of the order on
rehearing provided that before National fuel may begin construction of the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP94&hyph;112&hyph;000,
it must withdraw its prior notice request filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;693&hyph;000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will treat National Fuel's Notice of Withdrawal as a motion to vacate the authorization granted pursuant
to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.212 in Docket No. CP94&hyph;693&hyph;000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said motion to vacate should on or before November
3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have hereto filed need not file again.

Take notice that on October 5, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah
84111, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP95&hyph;8&hyph;000 pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205
and 157.216(b) of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to abandon a regulator
station and appurtenant facilities under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;491&hyph;000,
all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questar proposes to abandon and remove their Debenham District Regulator Station (Debenham DRS) and appurtenant
facilities located in Summit County, Utah. The Debanham DRS was previously utilized to deliver natural gas to Mountain
Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel), an affiliate of Questar. Mountain Fuel has installed and is currently operating
a new intermediate high-pressure (IHP) distribution line adjacent to the Debenham DRS, to serve a new residential
subdivision and additionally receives natural gas through Questar's DRS WA0388, located west of the Debenham DRS,
to serve its remaining customers. Questar states that the Debanham DRS consists of two 3/4-inch taps, approximately
105 feet of 3/4-inch pipeline, a can-type regulator set and appurtenant facilities. Questar further states that
the total investment associated with the DRS facilities proposed to be abandoned is $788.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after the Commission has issued this notice, file pursuant
to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and
pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest

Helen Gaidine Oglesbee (Oglesbee) filed a request for a hearing on February 28, 1994 under the Department of Energy's
Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 CFR part 708. Oglesbee had been and is currently an employee of Westinghouse
Hanford Company (WHC). She alleged that she made health and safety complaints to her immediate supervisor from December
1990 to August 1991, and that beginning in October or November 1991, she elevated these concerns to higher management
officials at WHC. Oglesbee maintained that WHC took the following reprisals against her: Failing to respond to her
health-related issues and denying her access to reports and analyses of those issues; removing her designation as
``lead'' secretary; issuing her a performance improvement plan; transferring her involuntarily to another WHC
office; issuing her a performance expectations letter; issuing her written reprimands, and delaying promotions
to Level IV Secretary and to permanent Plant Engineer. The DOE's Office of Contractor Employee Protection investigated
the complaint and found that no reprisals had been taken against Oglesbee that would entitle her to relief under part
708. Oglesbee requested a hearing before the OHA, reasserting her claim that reprisals were taken against her for
raising health and safety concerns. The Hearing Officer in the OHA determined that with regard to certain of the allegations
raised, Oglesbee failed to meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she made substantial
and specific disclosures concerning health and safety to WHC. In those instances where Oglesbee made protected disclosures
under part 708 followed closely in time by adverse personnel actions, the Hearing Officer found that WHC had proven
by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions absent Oglesbee's disclosures, or that
Oglesbee had already been provided an adequate remedy for the actions taken against her. Accordingly, the Hearing
Officer concluded that Oglesbee failed to establish the existence of any violations of the DOE Contractor Employee
Protection Program for which relief was warranted under &sect;708.10.

Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc. (Dow) submitted an application for refund in the Enron Corporation refund proceeding.
The DOE determined that Dow used Enron propane as a feedstock to produce certain olefins, primarily ethylene, and
therefore was entitled to a refund under the presumption of injury for end-users of Enron products. The total refund
granted to Dow, including interest, is $409,726.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Application for Refund of a claimant in the subpart V crude oil overcharge
refund proceeding. The Application for Refund was based on purchases of petroleum products the applicant used in
its jet airliners. The DOE determined that the applicant had waived its right to receive money from the Crude Oil Subpart
V Special Refund Proceeding. Accordingly, the Application for Refund was denied.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refund submitted in the Subpart V crude oil refund
proceeding by Koppers Company, Inc. and eight of its subsidiaries. All nine of these Applications were previously
granted. All of the applicants, however, were subsequently found to have been affiliated with Kaiser Sand &amp; Gravel
(Kaiser) on August 7, 1986. Kaiser had filed in the Surface Transporters Stripper Well proceeding, and in doing so,
Kaiser had executed a waiver and release waiving its rights and the rights of all its affiliates on August 7, 1986, to
receive a crude oil overcharge refund. Accordingly, this Decision rescinded the original refunds granted to the
nine applicants.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Resconsideration filed on behalf of Inter City Texaco in the
Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. The DOE had previously rescinded a refund granted erroneously to Inter City
(Case Nos. RF321&hyph;16561 and RF321&hyph;19481). Inter City had been granted a refund based on a schedule of purchases
provided by Texaco, but the OHA later discovered that Inter City was supplied indirectly for the entire price control
period. Inter City then filed a motion for reconsideration estimating its gallonage based on contemporaneous records
referring to gallonage purchases from its supplier, Kenny Larson Oil. We therefore found that Inter City satisfied
all the requirements necessary to obtain a refund in the Texaco proceeding and accordingly, Inter City's Motion for
Reconsideration was granted.

Kenneth Larson filed an Application for Refund on behalf of Kenny Larson Oil Company (Larson) requesting a refund
based on purchases of Texaco petroleum products. The DOE approved the application but, because Larson was in default
in its obligations pursuant to a consent order, determined that the refund should be used to fund the firm's escrow
account. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order granting the Application and ordering that the refund amount
be transferred from the Texaco Inc. escrow account to the Kenny Larson Oil Company escrow account.

Pioneer Press filed an Appeal from a determination issued to it on June 20, 1994, by the Chief of the FOI and Privacy Acts
Branch of the Reference and Information Management Division (Chief) of the Department of Energy (DOE). In that determination,
the Chief stated that the DOE did not find any documents responsive to the appellant's information request under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE confirmed that the Chief followed procedures
which were reasonably calculated to uncover the requested information, and had therefore undertaken an adequate
search. Accordingly, the DOE denied the Pioneer Press request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
 Statutory Framework
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) authorizes establishment of tolerances
and exemptions from tolerances for the residues of pesticides in or on raw agricultural commodities (RAC's), and
section 409 of the act authorizes promulgation of food additive regulations for pesticide residues in processed
foods (21 U.S.C. 346(a), 348). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 408 of the act, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from tolerances when appropriate, for pesticide
residues in raw agricultural commodities. Food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide
residues in processed foods are established under section 402 of the act. Section 409 food/feed additive regulations
are required, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 409(a)(2) of the FFDCA,
no section 409 food/feed additive regulation is required if any pesticide residues in a processed food resulting
from use on a RAC has been removed to the extent possible by good manufacturing practices and is below the tolerance
for that pesticide in or on that RAC. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through''
provision because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to processed food. Thus, a section 409
food additive regulation is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when despite the use of
good manufacturing practices the concentration of the pesticide residues in a processed food is greater than the
tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact
with a pesticide. Monitoring and enforcement are carried out by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of a food additive regulation under section 409 requires a finding that use of the pesticide will
be ``safe'' (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)). Section 409 also contains the ``Delaney Clause,'' which specifically provides
that, with limited exceptions, no additive may be approved if it has been found to induce cancer in man or animals (21
U.S.C. 348(c)(5)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In setting both section 408 tolerances and section 409 food/feed additive regulations, EPA reviews residue chemistry
and toxicology data. To be acceptable, tolerances must be both high enough to cover residues likely to be left when
the pesticide is used in accordance with its labeling and low enough to protect the public health. With respect to section
408 tolerances, EPA determines the highest levels of residues that might be present in a raw agricultural commodity
based on controlled field trials conducted under the conditions allowed by the product's labeling that are expected
to yield maximum residues. Generally, EPA's policy concerning whether a section 409 food additive regulation is
needed depends on whether there is a possibility that the processing of a raw agricultural commodity containing pesticide
residues would result in residues in the processed food at a level greater than the raw food tolerance.

II. Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Uniroyal Chemical Co. has submitted a petition requesting the revocation of the feed additive regulation established
under section 409 of the FFDCA for dimethipin on cottonseed hulls. The following provides background information
and sets forth the basis for the petitioner's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 408 tolerance for dimethipin on cottonseed is established at 0.5 part per million (ppm) (40 CFR 180.406).
The section 409 feed additive regulation on cottonseed hulls has been established at 0.7 ppm (40 CFR 186.2050). In
a peer review of dimethipin, dated January 5, 1990, EPA classified dimethipin as a Group C (possible human) carcinogen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dimethipin is the active ingredient in Harvade harvest growth regulants registered by Uniroyal. Uniroyal claims
that since Harvade is applied to cotton 7 to 14 days before anticipated harvest, a high percentage of the chemical is
deposited on the cotton leaf which subsequently abscises and drops to the soil surface.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniroyal Chemical is requesting revocation of the section 409 feed additive regulation for cottonseed hulls because,
they claim, that it is not needed and that revoking it will avoid any inconsistency with the Delaney Clause in section
409 of the FFDCA. According to Uniroyal, concentration of dimethipin in cottonseed hulls does not exceed the section
408 tolerance for cottonseed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support the assertion that there is no concentration in the processed commodity, the Petitioner references a processing
study [MRID No. 42920902], which was submitted as a requirement of reregistration of dimethipin. Uniroyal claims
that this work demonstrates that dimethipin residues do not concentrate in cottonseed hulls (a processed commodity)
when compared with those in ginned cottonseed (a raw agricultural commodity) (MRID No. 42467001 and 42920901). The
study results are summarized below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this new processed fraction study, maturing cotton was treated with an exaggerated (2X) rate, resulting in an average
cottonseed residue of 0.563 ppm. Values for cottonseed hulls averaged 0.451 ppm. Only one out of four of the individual
sample concentration factors (values for which are -41%, -30%, -5%, and +7%) suggest a small possibility of concentration.
The mean factor of -17% indicates a net dilution of nearly one-sixth in generating cottonseed hulls from raw cottonseed.
Uniroyal declares that since the 2X rate produced no residue in hulls higher than 0.53 ppm, treatment at the full labeled
1X rate will not have a reasonable probability of producing residues in cottonseed hulls higher than the RAC tolerance
of 0.5 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniroyal submitted a critique of two previous studies addressing the magnitude of dimethipin residues in cottonseed
and processed fractions. Uniroyal claims that the new study is better documented and more representative of real-world
conditions. In light of new data, the Petitioner urges EPA to reconsider whether a section 409 feed additive regulation
is necessary for dimethipin in cottonseed hulls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 40 CFR 177.125 and 177.30, EPA may issue an order ruling on the petition or may issue a proposal in response
to the petition and seek further comment. If EPA issues an order in response to the petition, any person adversely affected
by the order may file written objections and a request for a hearing on those objections with EPA on or before the 30th
day after the date of publication of the order (40 CFR 178.20).

By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $1,340,584.26 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund.
This payment represents approximately 13% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon which this settlement
is based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In exchange for payment, EPA will provide the settling parties with a limited covenant not to sue for liability under
sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA's past costs, the cost of the remedy, and future EPA
oversight costs, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above, depends upon whether they contributed radioactive hazardous
substances or non-radioactive hazardous substances to the Site. The price per pound cost for non-radioactive hazardous
substances is $1.9798857. The price per pound for radioactive hazardous substances is $3.9597714. Settlement amounts
are calculated by multiplying these per pound costs by the number of pounds of hazardous substances a party sent to
the Site (Base Amount), adding a premium payment of either 30% or 130% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent
PRP in the AOC, and adding a $200 administrative fee. For parties paying a 30% premium, there is an exception to the covenant
not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $10,000,000. For parties paying a 130% premium, there is an exception
to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $20,000,000.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and
entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the
authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. Under Commission rules, this proceeding contemplates
only the filing of comments and replies on the state's petition. This Order waives the prohibition on additional pleadings
found in &sect;20.13(a)(5) of the Commission's Rules and permits additional pleadings to be filed, pursuant to the
terms of &sect;1.45 of the Commission's Rules. The Order also denies a motion filed by Cellular Resellers Association,
Inc., Cellular Service, Inc. and ComTech Mobile Telephone Company to defer filing dates for the filing of replies
for reasons of efficient administration and docket management. This Order also dismisses as moot a Request for Issuance
of a public notice filed by National Cellular Resellers Association.

1. The Commission's rule governing the filing of pleadings in this proceeding contemplates only the filing of comments
and replies on the state's petition to retain authority over intrastate cellular rates. It thus excludes Section
1.45,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which governs the general filing periods for motions, from the procedural rules which may apply.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 This proceeding, however, raises confidentiality issues that have generated the filing of several motions and requests.

to the Terms of a Protective Order, filed by the National Cellular Resellers Association (Sept. 19, 1994); Emergency

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have also received PR Docket No. 94&hyph;105 Notice of Ex Parte Contact and Request for Issuance of a Public Notice
(Sept. 23, 1994), filed by the National Cellular Resellers Association (NCRA), asking that the Commission issue
a Public Notice permitting any interested party to participate by telephone or in person in a September 30, 1994 meeting
on confidentiality issues. All parties to the proceeding were given actual notice of the meeting and permitted to
participate either in person or by telephone. Moreover, on September 30, 1994, the Commission issued a Public Notice
of Comment Sought on Draft Protective Order, DA 94&hyph;1083, announcing that all interested parties could comment
by October 7, 1994 on a draft protective agreement that had been distributed to all parties of record. We believe that
these actions have rendered the NCRA request moot and we dismiss it on that ground.

2. We believe that equity requires that we permit interested parties to file nonfrivolous pleadings on confidentiality
and related issues. We thus waive the prohibition of &sect;20.13 on additional pleadings, and permit necessary additional
pleadings to be filed pursuant to the terms of &sect;1.45 of the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We have also received a Motion to Defer Filing Dates.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Movants ask that we defer the filing of replies, due October 19, 1994, to either (1) two weeks after opposing parties
file any supplemental comments based on the disclosure of confidential information or (2) two weeks after the Commission
issues a decision denying access to such confidential information. Movants contend that if additional information
is disclosed, this will require supplemental pleadings that will duplicate the October 19 replies and ``needlessly
expand the number of pleadings (and the time involved) for consideration by the Commission.''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 They argue that a grant of the Motion will expedite review by permitting the filing of a consolidated reply. They add
that if additional disclosure is not made, and the Commission moves quickly in reaching that decision, the proposed
procedure will result in only minimal delay.

4. We deny the Motion. As we explained in a recent order granting the parties a 15-day extension to file replies, the
Commission must meet a one-year statutory deadline for ruling on the state's petition and deciding any reconsideration.
We stressed that, ``The Commission is faced with stringent statutory deadlines in a complex and massive proceeding.''
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Although we agree with Movants that disclosure of additional information may require that we permit the parties to
supplement their comments, we cannot now predict whether such additional disclosure will be necessary. We believe
that efficient administration and docket management requires adherence to the October 19, 1994 deadline for filing
replies in this proceeding. For the foregoing reasons, we do not believe that good cause has been shown for the requested
deferral.

, either directly or through a subsidiary, in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely
related to banking and permissible for bank holding companies. Unless otherwise noted, such activities will be conducted
throughout the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise noted, comments regarding the applications must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated or the
offices of the Board of Governors not later than November 8, 1994.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company that can effectively pursue
the scientific and commercial generation and development of a panel of monoclonal antibodies against an epidermal
growth factor (EGF)-related peptide, cripto-1 (CR&hyph;1). The project is of scientific importance because CR&hyph;1
is a protein that exhibits structural homology to the EGF/transforming growth factor

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) gene family peptides. As such, CR&hyph;1 might function as a growth factor or growth inhibitor. Therefore, CR&hyph;1
may be important as an autocrine or paracrine modulator in such processes as tumor cell growth, wound repair, neovascularization,
and inflammation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCI has successfully isolated and cloned the gene that encodes CR&hyph;1, an EGF-related peptide growth factor that
does not function through the EGF receptor. The NCI has also obtained a rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibody that
can detect the expression of CR&hyph;1 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue sections. CR&hyph;1
has been shown to be preferentially and differentially expressed in several different human premalignant lesions
and cancers. The selected sponsor will purify a recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein and use this material as an immunogen
to generate anti-CR&hyph;1 monoclonal antibodies for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NCI is seeking a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company which, after obtaining a license in accordance with
the requirements of the regulations governing the transfer of Government-developed agents (37 CFR part 404), can
purify a recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein for which patents are pending or have been issued and to utilize this purified
recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein as an immunogen to generate a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies. The immunoreactive
CR&hyph;1 protein has been detected by immunoperoxidase staining using a rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal CR&hyph;1
antibody in a majority of human colon cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers and pancreatic cancers. Little or
no staining was detected in surrounding, noninvolved colon, breast or gastric epithelial cells. In addition, a majority
of premalignant colonic adenomas, breast ductal carcinomas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
in situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and gastric intestinal metaplasia express immunoreactive CR&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein has been generated using a yeast expression vector in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pichia pastoris 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and a partially purified protein obtained. This protein as well as synthetic, refolded peptides that correspond
to the EGF-like domain in CR&hyph;1 are mitogenic for human breast cancer cells yet fail to bind to the EGF receptor
or other type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Expression of CR&hyph;1 antisense mRNA using a recombinant, replication
defective retroviral expression vector in colon cancer cells that expresses CR&hyph;1 inhibits the growth of these
cells 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in nude mice. In order to utilize the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials of CR&hyph;1, it will be necessary to purify
a significant amount of the recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein to more fully define its biological properties and to identify
the receptor through which it functions. In addition, mouse monoclonal antibodies against the purified CR&hyph;1
recombinant protein will expedite screening studies for CR&hyph;1 expression in other human premalignant lesions
and cancers and should exhibit more specificity and sensitivity for the detection of CR&hyph;1 in tissues by immunocytochemistry
(ICC) or in tissue extracts or serum samples by ELISA.

 Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (82 Stat.
906, 16 U.S.C. 1273), and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Oregon, an 11-mile segment of the Klamath
River is hereby designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This
action is based on the designation of the river by the State of Oregon and the protection offered this river and its immediate
environment by and pursuant to applicable State laws and regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 22, 1993, Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add a segment of the
Klamath River to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
of March 4, 1994, page 10423.) Section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act allows a governor to request that rivers
already protected in a State System be included in the National System. In her application, Governor Roberts requested
that the 11-mile reach of the Klamath River from the J.C. Boyle Powerhouse (river mile 220.3) downstream to the Oregon-California
border (river mile 209.3) be protected as a wild and scenic river. Pursuant to section 2(a)(ii), the river will be managed
by the State of Oregon at no cost to the Federal Government except for those lands currently managed by the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a State-managed river to be eligible for the National System, three conditions must be met: (1) The river must be
free-flowing and possess at least one ``outstandingly remarkable'' natural, cultural or recreational value, (2)
the river must be part of a State system; and (3) the State must have effective mechanisms in place to protect the outstandingly
remarkable values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responsibility for making determinations of eligibility has been delegated to the National Park Service (NPS).
The NPS Pacific Northwest Region conducted a study and environmental assessment with the BLM acting as a cooperating
agency. In February of 1994, the NPS released the Draft Klamath Wild &amp; Scenic River Eligibility Report and Environmental
Assessment for public review and comment. A period for public comment on the report was provided from March 4, 1994,
to April 28, 1994. The draft report was finalized based on comments received. On August 12 the NPS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice that it had found that designation would not result in impacts significantly affecting the quality of the
environment and invited public comment through September 9. The notice also announced that the river under consideration
had been found eligible for the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System and the State of Oregon had met the criteria for
designation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is taken following public involvement and consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Army, Energy
and Transportation; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; all Department of the Interior agencies; the National
Marine Fisheries Service; the States of Oregon and California; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and all
other Federal agencies that might have an interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the recommendations of the NPS and a review of all relevant documents, I have determined that the 11-mile stretch
of the Klamath River should be designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
System, as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Notice is hereby given that effective
upon this date, the segment of the Klamath River from the J.C. Boyle Powerhouse to the Oregon-California border is
approved for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System as a National Scenic River.

 Pursuant to section 226 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1273) and 43 CFR 426.20 of the rules and regulations
published in 52 FR 11954, Apr. 13, 1987, Reclamation will publish notice of proposed or amendatory contract actions
for any contract for the delivery of project water for authorized uses in newspapers of general circulation in the
affected area at least 60 days prior to contract execution. Pursuant to the ``Final Revised Public Participation
Procedures'' for water resource-related contract negotiations, published in 47 FR 7763, Feb. 22, 1982, a tabulation
is provided of all proposed contractual actions in each of the five Reclamation regions. Each proposed action is,
or is expected to be, in some stage of the contract negotiation process in 1994. When contract negotiations are completed,
and prior to execution, each proposed contract form must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or pursuant
to delegated or redelegated authority, the Commissioner of Reclamation or one of the regional directors. In some
instances, congressional review and approval of a report, water rate, or other terms and conditions of the contract
may be involved.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public participation in and receipt of comments on contract proposals will be facilitated by adherence to the following
procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Only persons authorized to act on behalf of the contracting entities may negotiate the terms and conditions of a
specific contract proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Advance notice of meetings or hearings will be furnished to those parties that have made a timely written request
for such notice to the appropriate regional or project office of Reclamation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Written correspondence regarding proposed contracts may be made available to the general public pursuant to the
terms and procedures of the Freedom of Information Act (80 Stat. 383), as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Written comments on a proposed contract or contract action must be submitted to the appropriate regional officials
at the locations and within the time limits set forth in the advance public notices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. All written comments received and testimony presented at any public hearings will be reviewed and summarized by
the appropriate regional office for use by the contract approving authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Copies of specific proposed contracts may be obtained from the appropriate regional director or his designated
public contact as they become available for review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In the event modifications are made in the form of a proposed contract, the appropriate regional director shall
determine whether republication of the notice and/or extension of the comment period is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factors considered in making such a determination shall include, but are not limited to: (i) the significance of the
modification, and (ii) the degree of public interest which has been expressed over the course of the negotiations.
As a minimum, the regional director shall furnish revised contracts to all parties who requested the contract in response

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft Environmental
Assessment addressing genetic management options for the Florida panther,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Felis concolor coryi. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A single population estimated to number 30 to 50 adults represents the sole known remaining population in the wild.
This population utilizes approximately 2&hyph;3 million acres of habitat on public and privately owned lands in
south Florida. Existing data indicate that the Florida panther will likely to extinct without actions to restore
genetic health to the population. The Environmental Assessment examines four genetic management alternatives
for the panther. The preferred alternative involves a strategy to restore lost gene flow to the panther from a western

This notice is being furnished under provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1501.7)
to obtain comments from other agencies and the public on the draft Environmental Assessment. Following an appropriate
public comment and review process, the Service intends to evaluate all comments received and select an intended course

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goals of the Service's endangered species program. The Service will consider all
information presented during the public comment period prior to finalizing and implementing a specific genetic
management strategy for the Florida panther.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida panther is one of the most endangered large mammals in the world. The biological circumstances of geographic
isolation, habitat loss, population reductions, and associated inbreeding have resulted in significant loss of
genetic variability and health of the population. The genetic variability and health of the Florida population must
be restored for the tax on to survive even with adequate habitat preservation and other enhancement measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida panther formerly occupied a range comprising much of the southeastern United States. This range was contiguous
with other populations of North American cougars (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Felis concolor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spp.). The panther is presently restricted to a small relict population in southern Florida numbering 30 to 50 adults.
This population utilizes approximately 2&hyph;3 million acres of habitat on public and privately owned lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Population declines and associated inbreeding in the Florida panther have resulted in significant losses in genetic
variability and viability. The population exhibits multiple physiological abnormalities that are likely a consequence
of recent close inbreeding. High incidences of maladaptive traits which include reproductive and medical abnormalities
have been observed. Significant among these are: Cryptorchidism (50+% of male population at times), abnormal sperm
(average 93.5% per ejaculate), and atrial septal defects (5 individuals). Furthermore, the Florida panther has
suffered from numerous health problems and infectious diseases that many be a consequence of a defective immune system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal will be to develop and implement a management strategy to restore and maintain the historic genetic character
of the of Florida panther. The objectives will be to reduce the occurrence of inbreeding and restore genetic variability
and vitality of offspring produced and recruited as breeders into a healthier, ore resilient panther population
and to resume the evolutionary adaptive potential by restoring levels of genetic diversity in the Florida population
to levels comparable of other

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Felis concolor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
subspecies in western North America. The identification and implementation of actions needed to accomplish this
goal will be guided by the analysis and evaluation of various alternatives that may be available.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Red Hills salamander is a plethodontid salamander and the sole member of its genus. Its range is confined to a small
area of southern Alabama. Portions of the Applicant's lands in the Red Hills physiographic province of south-central
Alabama are occupied by this species. The applicant owns 80 acres of timberland within the Red Hills salamander's
historic range in Monroe County. The Applicant's HCP identifies a 15-acre preserve area characterized as having
steep slopes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
&gt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
30 percent), within the Tallahatta and/or Hatchetigbee geologic formations, have moist loamy topsoils, and forested
with naturally occurring mixed hardwood/pine and pine/hardwood trees. Previous status surveys for the species
indicate this to be optimal habitat, with burrow density as high as 5 per 100 square meters. Timber harvesting in the
adjacent streamside management zones, encompassing 16 acres of the property, will be restricted to removal of approximately
20 percent of the canopy coverage. These areas are considered marginal habitat for the Red Hills salamander. On the
remainder of the site (49 acres), normal timber harvesting will be conducted and will result in approximately 40 percent
of the canopy coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take incidental to the applicant's harvest plan is expected to occur in the marginally suitable areas, through the
physical crushing of burrows (and thus individuals) from timber felling and removal of large pine trees. Incidental
take of this nature is expected in approximately 5 acres of marginally suitable habitat. Mitigation and minimization
measures identified in the HCP include the preservation of 15 acres of optimal habitat, restrictions of cutting in
marginally suitable areas, restrictions of the use of chemical pesticides and herbicides within and in a 50-foot
buffer of optimum habitat, and training and education of logging personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
no action, or the HCP modified for a different mitigation strategy.

EP Operating has sited their proposed operations to avoid, as much as possible, impacts to wetlands, and has developed
mitigation measures to minimize unavoidable impacts. EP Operating proposes to compensate for direct loss of 0.11
acres of non-tidal wetlands by restoring 0.22 acres of an abandoned oil and gas access road to its original wind-tidal
flat condition. The wetlands compensation project is also located at Padre Island National Seashore.

Summary:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, the National
Park Service has prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the general management plan (GMP) for
Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, Hawaii County, Hawaii. The general management plan calls for the development
of access and visitor use facilities at the park. Facilities proposed in the park are limited to those essential for
the protection of resources, provision of visitor services, and perpetuation of the Hawaiian culture. They are confined
to areas already disturbed, known not to contain cultural or natural resources, and located away from the coast. Developments
are to be designed to blend in with the historical and open character of the park's landscape. Moreover, they are to
be located so as to not interfere with the traditional Hawaiian activities taking place in the park. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was released for public review in October 1992, and the public comment
period closed December 11, 1992. Both the DEIS and the FEIS evaluate the same proposal and three alternatives, and
information in the FEIS is essentially unchanged from the DEIS. The alternatives consist of no action, limited facility
development (minimum requirements), and maximization of vehicle access with more emphasis on recreational use.
The FEIS contains written responses to substantive comments made on the DEIS, as well as minor modifications and clarifications
to the text as appropriate in response to those comments.

through 695 (Final) under section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. &sect;1673d(b)) (the Act) to determine
whether an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment
of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from France, India, Israel, Malaysia,
the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings,

 provided for in subheading 7307.93.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The Commission also
gives notice of the schedule to be followed in these antidumping investigations and the ongoing countervailing duty
investigations regarding imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from India and Israel (invs. Nos.
701&hyph;TA&hyph;360 and 361 (Final)), which the Commission instituted effective May 31, 1994 (59 F.R. 37054, July
20, 1994). The schedules for the subject investigations will be identical, pursuant to Commerce's alignment of its
final subsidy and dumping determinations (59 F.R. 32955, June 27, 1994).

 The imported products covered by the scope of these investigations consist of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe
fittings having an inside diameter of less than 14 inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished
condition. Such pipe fittings are formed or forged carbon steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems
where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of
fastening (e.g., threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). The subject pipe fittings come in a variety of shapes which
include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of the finished pipe fittings are beveled,
so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel
is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joints the fitting to the pipe.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subject antidumping investigations are being instituted as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations
by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France, India, Israel,
Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela are being sold in the United States at
less than fair value within the meaning of section 733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The Commission instituted the subject
countervailing duty investigations on May 31, 1994 (59 F.R. 37054, July 20, 1994). Both investigations were requested
in a petition filed on February 28, 1994, by the U.S. Fittings Group, Washington, DC, an ad hoc trade association consisting
of five domestic firms: Hackney, Inc., Dallas, TX; Ladish Co., Inc., Cudahy, WI; Mills Iron Works, Inc., Gardena,
CA; Steel Forgings, Inc., Shreveport, LA; and Tube Forgings of America, Inc., Portland, OR.

 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. &sect;1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United States is not materially injured or threatened
with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United States is not materially retarded, by reason
of imports from Thailand of certain cased pencils,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 provided for in subheading 9609.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that have been found
by the Department of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV).

For purposes of its investigation, the Department of Commerce defined ``certain cased pencils'' as pencils of any
shape or dimension which are writing and/or drawing instruments that feature cores of graphite or other materials
encased in wood and/or manmade materials, whether or not decorated and whether or not tipped (e.g., with erasers,
etc.) in any fashion, and either sharpened or unsharpened. Specifically excluded from the scope of the investigations
are mechanical pencils, cosmetic pencils, pens, noncased crayons (wax), pastels, charcoals, or chalks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission instituted this investigation effective June 16, 1994, following a preliminary determination by
the Department of Commerce that imports of certain cased pencils from Thailand were being sold at LTFV within the meaning
of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. &sect;1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation
and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the
Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34865). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on August 25, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on October 13, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2816 (October 1994), entitled ``Certain Cased Pencils

Caldwell County Railroad Company (CCR), a noncarrier, has filed a notice of exemption for the lease, operation, and
possible future acquisition of a rail line

 The line extends from milepost HG&hyph;90.0 at Hickory, NC, to milepost HG&hyph;112.7 at Valmead, NC, a distance
of approximately 22.7 miles. The lease transaction was expected to be consummated on or after September 24, 1994.

The Caldwell County Economic Development Commission (CCEDC) is currently negotiating with NS for the purchase of
the line. Should CCEDC be successful in its efforts to acquire the line, it has agreed in principle to extend to CCR an
option to purchase the subject rail property. Both CCEDC's acquisition of the NS line and CCR's exercise of its option
to acquire the line from CCEDC, should it be formalized, would require subsequent Commission approval or exemption.
To the extent that the notice of exemption relates to the future purchase of the subject NS line, it is rejected.

The transaction is to be implemented pursuant to an agreement entered into by NS, C&amp;NW, and CCR under which the

to seek Commission approval to terminate operations over the line.

 The Department of Justice (Department) and the Federal Trade Commission (Commission) have drafted proposed new
Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations. The Guidelines, when adopted in final form by the
Department and the Commission, will state the antitrust enforcement policy of the Department and the Commission
with respect to the international aspects of business operations. The Department's 1988 Antitrust Guidelines for
International Operations will be withdrawn when these draft Guidelines are adopted in final form. Portions of the
1988 guidelines will also be superseded by the Department's proposed Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and
Acquisition of Intellectual Property, which recently have been published for public comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 These proposed Guidelines were drafted to state the current views of the Department and the Commission on antitrust
enforcement policy with respect to international business operations. The Guidelines are not intended to create
or recognize any legally enforceable right in any person. They are not intended to affect the admissibility of evidence
or in any other way necessarily to affect the course or conduct of any present or future litigation. Moreover, changes
in the relevant statutory framework, legal precedent, and methods of internal Department and Commission analysis
may occur over time, and these changes will not always be simultaneously reflected in amendments to the Guidelines.
Parties seeking to know the Department's or the Commission's specific enforcement intentions should consider using
the Department's Business Review Procedure, see 28 CFR 50.6 (1993), or the Commission's Advisory Opinion procedure.
See 16 C.F.R. &sect;&sect;1.1&hyph;1.4 (1993).

1. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For more than a century, the U.S. antitrust laws have stood as the ultimate protector of the competitive process that
underlies our free market economy. Through this process, society as a whole benefits from the best possible allocation
of resources, which in turn maximizes consumer choice and maintains competitive prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the federal antitrust laws have always applied to foreign commerce, that application is particularly important
today. Throughout the world, the importance of antitrust law as a means to ensure open and free markets, protect consumers,
and prevent conduct that impedes competition is becoming more apparent. The Department of Justice (``the Department'')
and the Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission'' or ``FTC'') (when referred to collectively, ``the Agencies''),
as the federal agencies charged with the responsibility of enforcing the antitrust laws, thus have made enforcement
of the antitrust laws with respect to international operations a top priority. In furtherance of this priority, the
Agencies have revised and updated the Department's 1988 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations,
which are hereby withdrawn.

The U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Guidelines for the Enforcement and Acquisition of Intellectual Property
(Proposed), the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines (1992), and
the Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy and Analytical Principles Relating to Health Care and Antitrust,
Jointly Issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (1994), are not qualified, modified,
or otherwise amended by the issuance of these Guidelines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations (hereinafter ``Guidelines'') are intended
to provide antitrust guidance to businesses engaged in international operations on questions that relate specifically
to the Agencies' international enforcement policy.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 They do not, therefore, provide a complete statement of the Agencies' general enforcement policies. The topics covered
include the Agencies' subject matter jurisdiction over conduct and entities outside the United States and the considerations,
issues, policies, and processes that govern their decision to exercise that jurisdiction; comity; mutual assistance
in international antitrust enforcement; and the effects of foreign governmental involvement on the antitrust liability
of private entities. In addition, the Guidelines discuss the relationship between antitrust and international
trade initiatives. Finally, to illustrate how these principles may operate in certain contexts, the Guidelines
include a number of examples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Readers should separately evaluate the risk of private litigation by competitors, consumers and suppliers, as well
as the risk of enforcement by state prosecutors under state and federal antitrust laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As is the case with all guidelines, users should rely on qualified counsel to assist them in evaluating the antitrust
risk associated with any contemplated transaction or activity. No set of guidelines can possibly indicate how the
Agencies will assess the particular facts of every case. Persons seeking more specific advance statements of enforcement
intentions with respect to the matters treated in these Guidelines should use the Department's Business Review procedure,
the Commission's Advisory Opinion procedure, or one of the more specific procedures described below for particular
types of transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Foreign commerce cases can involve almost any provision of the antitrust laws.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Agencies do not discriminate in the enforcement of the antitrust laws on the basis of the nationality of the parties.
Once jurisdictional requirements and considerations of international comity have been considered and satisfied,
the same substantive rules apply to all.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain exceptions may arise due to jurisdictional limitations. For example, the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.
&sect;13 (1988), applies only to purchases involving commodities ``for use, consumption, or resale within the United
States.'' It has been construed not to apply to sales for export See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
General Chem., Inc. v. Exxon Chem. Co., 625 F.2d 1231, 1234 (5th Cir. 1980). Intervening domestic sales, however,
would be subject to the Act. See Raul Int'l Corp. v. Sealed Power Corp., 586 F. Supp. 349, 351&hyph;55 (D.N.J.) 1984).

The following is a brief summary of the laws enforced by the Agencies that are likely to have the greatest significance
for international transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2.1&blank;Sherman Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1, sets forth the basic antitrust prohibition against contracts, combinations,
and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations. Section 2 of the
Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;2, prohibits monopolization, attempts to monopolize, and conspiracies to monopolize any part
of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations. Section 6a of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;6a,
defines the jurisdictional reach of the Act with respect to non-import foreign commerce.

Violations of the Sherman Act may be prosecuted as civil or criminal offenses. Conduct that the Department prosecutes
criminally is limited to traditional

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
offenses of the law, which typically involve price-fixing, customer allocation, bid-rigging or other cartel activities
that would also be violations of the law in many countries. Criminal violations of the Act are punishable by fines and
imprisonment. The Sherman Act provides that corporate defendants may be fined up to $10 million, other defendants
may be fined up to $350,000, and individuals may be sentenced to up to 3 years' imprisonment.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Department has sole responsibility for the criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act. In a civil proceeding, the
Department may obtain injunctive relief against prohibited practices. It may also obtain treble damages if the U.S.
government is the purchaser of affected goods or services.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Private plaintiffs may also obtain injunctive and treble damage relief for violations of the Sherman Act. Before
the Commission conduct that violates the Sherman Act may be challenged pursuant to the Commission's power under Section
5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, described below.

Defendants may be fined up to twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss caused by their offense in lieu of the Sherman Act
fines, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect;3571(d) (1988 &amp; Supp. 1993). In addition, the U.S. Sentencing Commission
Guidelines provide further information about possible criminal sanctions for individual antitrust defendants
in &sect;2R1.1 and for organizational defendants in Chapter Eight.

<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;18, prohibits any merger or acquisition of stock or assets ``where in
any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition
may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.''
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15 of the Clayton Act empowers the Attorney General, and Section 13(b) of the FTC Act empowers the Commission,
to seek a court order enjoining consummation of a merger that would violate Section 7. In addition, the Commission
may seek a cease and desist order in an administrative proceeding against a merger under either Section 11 of the Clayton
Act or Section 5 of the FTC Act, or both. Private parties may also seek injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. &sect;26.

``Persons'' include corporations or associations existing under or authorized either by the laws of the United States

Section 3 of the Clayton Act prohibits any person engaged in commerce from conditioning the lease or sale of goods or
commodities upon the purchaser's agreement not to use the products of a competitor, if the effect may be substantially
to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 In evaluating transactions, the trend of recent authority is to use the same analysis employed in the evaluation of
tying under Sherman Act Section 1 to assess a defendant's liability under Section 3 of the Clayton Act.

Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (``FTC Act'') declares unlawful ``unfair methods of competition in
or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Pursuant to its authority over unfair methods of competition, the Commission may take administrative action against
conduct that violates the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, as well as anticompetitive practices that do not fall within
the scope of the Sherman or Clayton Acts. The Commission may also seek injunctive relief in federal court against any
such conduct under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. Although enforcement at the Commission relating to international
deceptive practices has become increasingly important over time, these Guidelines are limited to the Commission's
antitrust authority under the unfair methods of competition language of Section 5.

2.4&blank;Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (``HSR Act''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;18a, provides
the Department and the Commission with several procedural devices to facilitate enforcement of the antitrust laws
with respect to anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The HSR Act requires persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce to notify the Agencies of proposed
mergers or acquisitions that would exceed statutory size-of-party and size-of-transaction thresholds,
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 to provide certain information relating to reportable transactions, and to wait for a prescribed period_15 days
for cash tender offers and 30 days for all other transactions_before consummating the transaction.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The Agency may, before the end of the waiting period, request additional information concerning a transaction (make
a ``Second Request'') and thereby extend the waiting period beyond the initial one prescribed, to a specified number
of days after the receipt of the material required by the Second Request_10 days for cash tender offers and 20 days for
all other transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The scope of the Agencies' jurisdiction under Clayton &sect;7 exceeds the scope of those transactions subject to
the premerger notification requirements of the HSR Act. Whether or not the HSR Act premerger notification thresholds
are satisfied, either Agency may request the parties to a merger affecting U.S. commerce to provide information voluntarily
concerning the transaction. In addition, the Department may issue Civil Investigative Demands (``CIDs'') pursuant
to the Antitrust Process Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1311&hyph;1314 (1988), and the Commission may issue administrative
CIDs pursuant to the Act of Aug. 26, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;312, &sect;7; 108 Stat. 1691 (1994). The Commission
may also issue administrative subpoenas and orders to file special reports under Sections 9 and 6(b) of the FTC Act,
respectively. 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;49, 46(b) (1988). Authority in particular cases is allocated to either the
Department or the Commission pursuant to a voluntary clearance protocol. See Antitrust &amp; Trade Reg. Daily (BNA),
Dec. 6, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless exempted pursuant to the Act, the parties must provide premerger notification to the Agencies if (1) the acquiring
person, or the person whose voting securities or assets are being acquired, is engaged in commerce or any activity
affecting commerce; and (2)(a) any voting securities or assets of a person engaged in manufacturing which has annual
net sales or total assets of $10 million or more are being acquired by any person which has total assets or annual net
sales of $100 million or more, or (b) any voting securities or assets of a person not engaged in manufacturing which
has total assets of $10 million or more are being acquired by any person which has total assets or annual sales of $100
million or more; or (c) any voting securities or assets of a person with annual net sales or total assets of $100 million
or more are being acquired by any person with total assets or annual net sales of $10 million or more; and (3) as a result
of such acquisition, the acquiring person would hold (a) 15 percent or more of the voting securities or assets of the
acquired person, or (b) an aggregate total amount of the voting securities and assets of the acquired person of $15
million. 15 U.S.C. &sect;18a(a) (1988). The size of the transaction test set forth in (3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
must be read in conjunction with 16 CFR 802.20 (1994). This Section exempts asset acquisitions valued at $15 million
or less. It also exempts voting securities acquisitions of $15 million or less unless, as a result of the acquisition,
the acquiring person would hold 50 percent or more of the voting securities of an issuer that has annual net sales or
total assets of $25 million or more. The HSR rules are necessarily technical, and should be consulted, rather than
relying on this summary.

 Failure to comply with the HSR Act is punishable by court-imposed civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each day a violation

The National Cooperative Research and Production Act (``NCRPA''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;4301&hyph;06, clarifies
the substantive application of the U.S. antitrust laws to joint research and development activities and joint production
activities. Originally drafted to encourage research and development by providing a special antitrust regime for
research and development (``R&amp;D'') joint ventures, the NCRPA requires U.S. courts to judge the competitive
effects of a challenged joint R&amp;D or joint production venture, or a combination of the two, in properly defined
relevant markets and under a rule-of-reason standard. The statute specifies that the conduct ``shall be judged on
the basis of its reasonableness, taking into account all relevant factors affecting competition, including, but
not limited to, effects on competition in properly defined, relevant research, development, product, process,
and service markets.'' 15 U.S.C. &sect;4302. This approach is consistent with the Agencies' general analysis of
joint ventures.

The NCRPA also establishes a voluntary procedure pursuant to which the Attorney General and the FTC may be notified
of a joint R&amp;D or production venture. The statute limits the monetary relief that may be obtained in private civil
suits against the participants in a notified venture to actual rather than treble damages, if the challenged conduct
is within the scope of the notification. With respect to joint production ventures, the National Cooperative Production
Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;42, 107 Stat. 117, 119, provide that the benefits of the limitation on recoverable
damages for claims resulting from conduct within the scope of a notification are not available unless (1) the principal
facilities for the production are located within the United States or its territories, and (2) ``each person who controls
any party to such venture (including such party itself) is a United States person, or a foreign person from a country
whose law accords antitrust treatment no less favorable to United States persons than to such country's domestic
persons with respect to participation in joint ventures for production.'' 15 U.S.C. &sect;4306(2) (Supp. 1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (the ``ETC Act''), Pub. L. No. 97&hyph;290, 96 Stat. 1234, is designed to increase
U.S. exports of goods and services. It addresses that goal in several ways. First, in Title II, it encourages more efficient
provision of export trade services to U.S. producers and suppliers by reducing restrictions on trade financing provided
by financial institutions.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Second, in Title III, it reduces uncertainty concerning the application of the U.S. antitrust laws to export trade
through the creation of a procedure by which persons engaged in U.S. export trade may obtain an export trade certificate
of review (``ETCR'').
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Third, in Title IV, it clarifies the jurisdictional rules applicable to non-import cases brought under the Sherman
Act and the FTC Act.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The Title III certificates are discussed briefly here; the jurisdictional rules are treated below in Section 3.1.

Although an ETCR provides significant protection under the antitrust laws, it has certain limitations. First, conduct
that falls outside the scope of a certificate remains fully subject to private and governmental enforcement actions.
Second, an ETCR that is obtained by fraud is void from the outset and thus offers no protection under the antitrust laws.
Third, any person that has been injured by certified conduct may recover actual (though not treble) damages if that
conduct is found to violate any of the statutory criteria described above. In any such action, certified conduct enjoys
a presumption of legality, and the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees.

The Revenue Act of 1916, better known as the Antidumping Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;71&hyph;74, is not an antitrust
statute, but its subject matter is closely related to the antitrust rules regarding predation. It is a trade statute
that creates a private claim against importers who sell goods into the United States at prices substantially below
the prices charged for the same goods in their home market. In order to state a claim, a plaintiff must show both that
such lower prices were commonly and systematically charged, and that the importer had the specific intent to injure
or destroy an industry in the United States, or to prevent the establishment of an industry. Dumping cases are more
commonly brought using the administrative procedures of the Tariff Act of 1930, discussed below.

Section 301 of this Act, 19 U.S.C. 2411, provides that the U.S. Trade Representative (``USTR''), subject to the specific
direction, if any, of the President, may take action, including restricting imports, to enforce rights of the United
States under any trade agreement, to address acts inconsistent with the international legal rights of the United
States, or to respond to unjustifiable, unreasonable or discriminatory practices of foreign governments that burden
or restrict U.S. commerce. Interested parties may initiate such actions through petitions to the USTR, or the USTR
may itself initiate proceedings.

 Of particular interest to antitrust enforcement is Section 301(d)(3)(B)(III), which includes among the ``unreasonable''
practices of foreign governments that might justify a proceeding the ``toleration by a foreign government of systematic
anticompetitive activities by private firms or among enterprises in the foreign country that have the effect of restricting

To further the twin goals of promoting enforcement cooperation between the United States and foreign governments
and of reducing any tensions that may arise in particular proceedings, the Agencies have developed close bilateral
relationships with antitrust and competition policy officials of many different countries. In some instances,
understandings have been reached with respect to notifications, consultations, and cooperation in antitrust matters.
In other instances, more general rules endorsed by multilateral organizations such as the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (``OECD'') provide the basis for the Agencies' cooperative policies. Finally, even
in the absence of specific or general international understandings or recommendations, the Agencies often seek
cooperation with foreign authorities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 International antitrust cooperation can also occur through mutual legal assistance treaties (``MLATs''), which
are treaties of general application pursuant to which the United States and a foreign country agree to assist one another
in criminal law enforcement matters. MLATs currently are in force with nearly 20 foreign countries, and many more
are in the process of ratification or negotiation. However, only the MLAT with Canada has been used to date to cover
antitrust offenses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies also hold regular consultations with the antitrust officials of Canada, the European Commission, and
Japan, and have close, informal ties with the antitrust authorities of many other countries. Since 1990, they have
cooperated closely with countries in the process of establishing competition agencies, assisted by funding provided
by the Agency for International Development.

Just as the acts of U.S. citizens in a foreign nation ordinarily are subject to the law of the country in which they occur,
the acts of foreign citizens in the United States ordinarily are subject to U.S. law. The reach of the U.S. antitrust
laws is not limited, however, to conduct and transactions that occur within the boundaries of the United States. Anticompetitive
conduct that affects U.S. domestic or foreign commerce may violate the U.S. antitrust laws regardless of where such
conduct occurs or the nationality of the parties involved. In a world in which economic transactions observe no boundaries,
international recognition of the ``effects doctrine'' of jurisdiction has become widespread.

 These facts present the straightforward case of cartel participants selling products directly into the United States.
In this situation, the transaction is unambiguously an import into the U.S. market, and the sale is not complete until
the goods reach the United States. Thus, U.S. jurisdiction is clear under the general principles of antitrust law
expressed most recently in

The general jurisdictional reach of Section 7 is co-extensive with the reach of the Sherman Act, as a result of the 1980
amendment of the Clayton Act extending it to all matters affecting commerce, which includes trade or commerce with
foreign nations.

Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: As noted above, the jurisdictional provisions of Section 7 of the Clayton Act reach the stock and asset acquisitions
of persons engaged in ``any activity affecting commerce.'' In assessing jurisdiction under Section 7 for international
transactions the Agencies analyze the question of effects on commerce in a manner consistent with the foreign Trade
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (``FTAIA'')
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
: that is, they look to see whether the effects on U.S. domestic or import commerce are direct, substantial, and reasonably
foreseeable.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 It is appropriate to do so because the FTAIA sheds light on the type of effects Congress considered necessary for foreign
commerce cases, even though the FTAIA itself did not amend the Clayton Act. On the facts of this example, the Agencies
would conclude that Section 7 jurisdiction exists.
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>

would seek to coordinate their efforts with other authorities who are examining the transaction. Through concepts
such as ``positive comity,'' one country's authorities may ask another country to take measures that address possible
harm to competition in the requesting country's market.

Companies E and F are the only producers of product Q in country Epsilon, one of the biggest markets for sales of Q in the
world. E and F together account for 90% of the sales of product Q in Epsilon. In order to prevent a competing U.S. producer
from entering the market in Epsilon, E and F agree that neither one of them will purchase or distribute the U.S. product,
and that they will take ``all feasible'' measures to keep the U.S. company out of their market. Without specifically
discussing what other measures they will take to carry out this plan, E and F meet with their distributors and, through
a variety of threats and inducements, obtain agreement of all the distributors not to carry the U.S. product. There
are no commercially feasible substitute distribution channels available to the U.S. producer. Because of the actions
of E and F, the U.S. producer cannot find any distributors to carry its product and is unable to enter the market in Epsilon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agreement between E and F not to purchase or distribute the U.S. product would clearly have a direct and reasonable
foreseeable effect on U.S. export commerce, since it is aimed at a U.S. exporter. The substantiality of the effects
on U.S. exports would depend on the significance of E and F as purchasers and distributors of Q, although on these facts
virtually total foreclosure from the Epsilon market would almost certainly qualify as a substantial effect for jurisdictional
purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent that conduct in foreign countries does not ``involve'' import commerce but does have an ``effect'' on
either import transactions or commerce within the United States, the Agencies apply the ``direct, substantial,
and reasonable foreseeable'' standard of the FTAIA. That standard is applied, for example, in cases in which a cartel
of foreign enterprises, or a foreign monopolist, reaches the U.S. market through any mechanism that goes beyond direct
sales, such as the use of an unrelated intermediary, as well as cases in which foreign vertical restrictions or intellectual
property licensing arrangements have an anticompetitive effect on U.S. commerce.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As in Illustrative Example A, the foreign cartel produces a product in several foreign countries. None of its members
have any U.S. production, nor do any of them have U.S. subsidiaries. They organize a cartel for the purpose of raising
the price for the product in question. Rather than selling directly into the United States, however, the cartel sells
to an intermediary outside the United States, which they know will resell the product in the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The jurisdictional analysis would change slightly from the one presented in Example A, because not only is the conduct
being challenged entered into by cartelists in a foreign country, but it is also initially implemented through a sale
made in a foreign country. Despite the different test, however, the outcome would remain the same. The existence of
the intermediary would trigger the application of the FTAIA because the conduct would not involve import commerce
within the meaning of the FTAIA and the Agencies would have to determine whether the challenged conduct had ``direct,
substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects'' on U.S. domestic or import commerce. Furthermore, in keeping
with the Supreme Court's admonition in

, 111 S. Ct. 1842, 1847 (1991), the Agencies would focus on the potential harm that would ensue if the conspiracy were

commerce.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Widgets are manufactured in both the United States and various other countries around the world. The non-U.S. manufacturers
get together privately outside the United States and agree among themselves to raise prices to specified levels and
take measures to restrict imports into their respective countries, but specifically indicate that sales in the United
States are not covered, and that each company will be free independently to set its prices for the U.S. market. Over
time, however, the cartel members unilaterally begin to sell excess production into the United States as a means by
which to stabilize the existing pact. The resulting sales into the United States affect output and price in the United
States and U.S. exports are impaired.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This example is intended to highlight the type of effects on U.S. commerce that can result from a price-fixing agreement
that expressly excludes sales in the United States and thus does not involve import commerce within the meaning of
the FTAIA. The jurisdictional issue presented, therefore, is whether the consequence of each party's unilateral
decision to sell into the United States in order to stabilize the agreement is sufficiently direct and reasonably
foreseeable under the FTAIA to satisfy the jurisdictional standard. If the facts showed that certain members of the
cartel independently sold in a manner that was not attributable to the agreement, the Agencies would not have jurisdiction
to challenge the underlying agreement.
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 However, if the facts showed that the cartel anticipated affecting the U.S. market as a necessary and indispensable
aspect of the original conspiracy, then the express exclusion of the U.S. market in the price-fixing agreement would
be pretextual. In that case, the cartel would be affecting output and price in the United States, and the sales into
the United States to alleviate pressure on the cartel would be considered sufficiently direct to satisfy the requirements
of the FTAIA. In addition, because the illegal agreement incorporated provisions designed to restrict access to
foreign markets and stymied efforts by U.S. firms to export, the facts would support a conclusion that the agreement's
restraints had a ``direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect'' on the commerce of U.S. exporters. See
infra Sec. 3.133.

If the Agencies lack jurisdiction under the FTAIA to challenge the cartel, the facts of this example would nonetheless
lend themselves well to cooperative enforcement action among antitrust agencies. Virtually every country with
an antitrust law prohibits horizontal cartels and the Agencies would willingly cooperate with foreign authorities
taking direct action against the cartel in the countries where the agreement has raised the price of widgets to the
extent such cooperation is allowed under U.S. law and any agreement executed pursuant to U.S. law with foreign agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two categories of ``export cases'' fall within the FTAIA's jurisdictional test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Agencies may in appropriate cases take enforcement action against anticompetitive conduct, wherever
occurring, that restrains U.S. exports, if (1) the conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable
effect on exports of goods or services from the United States, and (2) the U.S. courts can obtain jurisdiction over
the foreign persons or corporations engaged in such conduct.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 As Section 3.2 below explains more fully, if the conduct is unlawful under the importing country's antitrust laws
as well, the Agencies are also prepared to work with that country's authorities if they are better situated to remedy
the conduct, and if they are prepared to take action against such conduct pursuant to their antitrust laws that will
address the U.S. concerns.

See U.S. Department of Justice Press Release dated April 3, 1992 (announcing enforcement policy that would permit
the Department to challenge foreign business conduct that harms American exports when the conduct would have violated
U.S. antitrust laws if it occurred in the United States).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Agencies may in appropriate cases take enforcement action against conduct by U.S. exporters that has
a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on trade or commerce within the United States, or on import
trade or commerce. This can arise in two principal ways. First, if demand in the United States were inelastic or if sellers
not involved in the agreement are unable to increase sales readily, an agreement among U.S. firms regarding the level
of their exports that had a substantial share of the relevant market could reduce supply and raise prices in the United
States.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 Second, conduct ostensibly export-related could affect the price of products sold or resold in the United States.
This kind of effect could occur if, for example, U.S. firms fixed the price of an input used to manufacture a product
overseas for ultimate resale in the United States.

Situation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Companies, P, Q, R, and S, organized under the laws of country Alpha, all manufacture and distribute construction
equipment. Much of that equipment is protected by patents in the various countries where it is sold, including Alpha.
The companies all belong to a private trade association, which develops industry standards that are often (although
not always) adopted by Alpha's regulatory authorities. Feeling threatened by competition from the United States,
the companies agree at a trade association meeting (1) to refuse to adopt any U.S. company technology as an industry
standard, and (2) to boycott any distributor of construction equipment that stocks competing U.S. products. The
U.S. companies have taken all necessary steps to protect their intellectual property under the law of Alpha. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this example, the collective activity impedes U.S. companies in two ways: Their technology is boycotted (even
if U.S. companies are willing to license their intellectual property) and they are foreclosed from access to existing
distributors who cannot afford to lose the accounts of their major domestic companies. The jurisdictional question
is whether these actions create a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on the exports of U.S. companies.
The mere fact that only the market of Alpha appears to be foreclosed is not enough to defeat such an effect. Only if exclusion
from Alpha as a quantitative measure were so 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 in terms of actual volume of trade that there would not be a substantial effect on U.S. export commerce would jurisdiction
be lacking. Given that this example involves construction equipment, a generally highly priced capital good, the
exclusion from Alpha would probably satisfy the substantiality requirement for FTAIA jurisdiction, even if U.S.
exports to Alpha would be expected to amount to only a few machines. This arrangement appears to have been created with
particular reference to competition from the United States, which indicates that the effects on U.S. exports are
both direct and foreseeable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies may, in appropriate cases, take enforcement action when the U.S. Government is a purchaser, or substantially
funds the purchase, of goods or services for consumption or use abroad. Cases in which the effect of anticompetitive
conduct with respect to the sale of these goods or services falls primarily on U.S. taxpayers may qualify for redress
under the federal antitrust laws.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 As a general matter, the Agencies consider there to be a sufficient effect on U.S. commerce to support the assertion
of jurisdiction if, as a result of its payment or financing, the U.S. Government bears more than half the cost of the
transaction. For purposes of this determination, the Agencies apply the standards used in certifying export conduct
under the ETC Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;4011&hyph;21 (1982).

Sales made by a foreign party to the U.S. Government, including to a U.S. facility located in a foreign country, are
within U.S. antitrust jurisdiction when they fall within the rule of Section 3.13 above. Bid-rigging of sales to the
U.S. Government represents the kind of conduct that can lead to an antitrust action. Indeed, in the United States this
type of behavior is normally prosecuted by the Department as a criminal offense. In practice, the Department has whenever
possible worked closely with the host country antitrust authorities to explore remedies under local law. This has
been successful in a number of instances.

3.2&blank;COMITY
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In enforcing the antitrust laws, the Agencies consider international comity. Comity itself reflects the broad concept
of respect among co-equal sovereign nations and plays a role in determining ``the recognition which one nation allows
within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation.''
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, in determining whether to assert jurisdiction to investigate or bring an action, or to seek particular remedies
in a given case, each Agency takes into account whether significant interests of any foreign sovereign would be affected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In performing a comity analysis, the Agencies take into account all relevant factors. Among others, these may include:
(1) the relative significance to the alleged violation of conduct within the United States, as compared to conduct
abroad; (2) the nationality of the persons involved in or affected by the conduct; (3) the presence or absence of a purpose
to affect U.S. consumers, markets, or exporters; (4) the relative significance and foreseeability of the effects
of the conduct on the United States as compared to the effects abroad; (5) the existence of reasonable expectations
that would be furthered or defeated by the action; (6) the degree of conflict with foreign law or articulated foreign
economic policies; (7) the effect on foreign enforcement; and (8) the effectiveness of foreign enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relative weight that each factor should be given depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. With respect
to the factor concerning foreign law, the Supreme Court made clear in Hartford Fire
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 that no conflict exists for purposes of an international comity analysis in the courts if the person subject to regulation
by two states can comply with the laws of both. Bearing this in mind, the Agencies first ask what laws or policies of the
arguably interested foreign jurisdictions are implicated by the conduct in question. There may be no actual conflict
between the antitrust enforcement interests of the United States and the laws or policies of a foreign sovereign.
This is increasingly true as more countries adopt antitrust or competition laws that are compatible with those of
the United States. In these cases, the anticompetitive conduct in question may also be prohibited under the pertinent
foreign laws, and thus the only possible conflict would relate to enforcement practices or remedy. If the laws or policies
of a foreign nation are neutral, it is again possible for the parties in question to comply with the U.S. prohibition
without violating foreign law. Of course, the Agencies take into account comity factors beyond whether there is a
conflict with foreign law. For example, in deciding whether or not to challenge an alleged antitrust violation, the
Agencies would, as part of a comity analysis, consider whether one country either encourages a certain course of conduct
or wishes to leave parties free to choose among different strategies, while another opts to prohibit some of those
strategies.

In lieu of bringing an enforcement action, or course, the Agencies may consult with interested foreign sovereigns
through appropriate diplomatic channels to attempt to eliminate anticompetitive effects in the United States.
If, however, the United States decides to prosecute an antitrust action, such a decision represents a determination
by the Executive Branch that the importance of antitrust enforcement outweighs any relevant foreign policy concerns.
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 The Department does not believe that it is the role of the courts to ``second-guess the executive branch's judgment
as to the proper role of comity concerns under these circumstances.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 To date, no Commission cases have presented this issue. It is important also to note that in disputes between private
parties, many courts are willing to undertake a comity analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Situation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A group of buyers in one foreign country decide that they will agree on the price that they will offer to suppliers of
a particular product that they procure from overseas. Major suppliers of that product are located in the United States
and the agreement results in substantial loss of sales and capacity reductions in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
From a jurisdictional point of view, the FTAIA standard appears to be satisfied because the effects on U.S. exporters
presented here are direct and the percentage of supply accounted for by the buyers' cartel is substantial given the
fact that the U.S. suppliers are ``major.'' The Agencies, however, would also take into consideration the comity
aspects presented before deciding whether or not to proceed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with its consideration of comity and its obligations under various international agreements, the Agencies
would ordinarily notify the antitrust authority in the cartel's home country. If that authority were in a better position
to address the competitive problem, and were prepared to take effective action to address the adverse effects on U.S.
commerce, the Agencies would consider working cooperatively with the foreign authority or staying their own remedy
pending enforcement efforts by the foreign country. In deciding whether to proceed, the Agencies would weigh the
factors relating to comity set forth above. Factors weighing in favor of bringing such an action include the substantial
harm caused by the cartel to the United States and the fact that the foreign parties purposefully availed themselves
of the benefits of doing business in and with the United States.

Foreign governments may be involved in a variety of ways in conduct that may have antitrust consequences. To address
the implications of such foreign governmental involvement, Congress and the courts have developed four special
doctrines: The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity; the doctrine of foreign sovereign compulsion; the act of
state doctrine; and the application of the

The scope of immunity of a foreign government or its agencies and instrumentalities (hereinafter foreign government)
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 from the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts for all causes of action, including antitrust, is governed by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (``FSIA'').

 Subject to the treaties in place at the time of FSIA's enactment, a foreign government is immune from suit except where

Section 1603(b) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 defines an ``agency or instrumentality of a foreign
state'' to be any entity ``(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise; and (2) which is an organ of
a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned
by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof; and (3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States

The commercial activity also must have a substantial nexus with the United States before a foreign government is subject
to suit. The FSIA sets out three different standards for meeting this requirement. First, the challenged conduct
by the foreign government may occur in the United States.
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 Alternatively, the challenged commercial activity may entail an act performed in the United States in connection
with a commercial activity of the foreign government elsewhere.
<FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>
 Or, finally, the challenged commercial activity of a foreign government outside of the United States may produce
a direct effect within the United States, i.e., there is an effect which follows ``as an immediate consequence of the

, if it is possible for the party to comply both with the foreign law and the U.S. antitrust laws, the existence of the
foreign law does not provide any excuse for actions that do not comply with U.S. law. However, sometimes a direct conflict

In these circumstances, at least one court has recognized a defense under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the Agencies
will also recognize it.
<FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>
 There are two rationales underlying the defense of foreign sovereign compulsion. First, Congress enacted the U.S.
antitrust laws against the background of well recognized principles of international law and comity among nations,
pursuant to which U.S. authorities give due deference to the acts of foreign governments acting within their own spheres
of authority. A defense for actions taken under the circumstances spelled out below serves to accommodate two equal
sovereigns. Second, important considerations of fairness to the defendant require some mechanism that provides
a predictable rule of decision for those seeking to conform their behavior to all pertinent laws.

doctrine applies not just to the actions of states and their subdivisions, but also to private anticompetitive conduct
that is both undertaken pursuant to clearly articulated state policies, and is actively supervised by the state.

Because of the limited scope of the defense, the Agencies will refrain from enforcement actions on the ground of foreign
sovereign compulsion only when certain criteria are satisfied. First the foreign government must have compelled
the anticompetitive conduct in circumstances in which refusal to comply with the foreign government's command would
give rise to the imposition of penal or other severe sanctions. As a general matter, the Agencies regard the foreign
government's formal representation that refusal to comply with its commend would have such a result as being sufficient
to establish that the conduct in question has been compelled, as long as the representation contains sufficient detail
to enable them to see precisely how the compulsion would be accomplished under the local law.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 Foreign government measures short of compulsion do not suffice for this defense, although they can be relevant in
a comity analysis.

For example, the Agencies may not regard as dispositive a statement that is ambiguous or that on its face appears to
be internally inconsistent. The Agencies may inquire into the circumstances underlying the statement and they may
also request further information if the source of the power to compel is unclear.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, although there can be no strict territorial test for this defense, the defense normally applies only when
the foreign government compels conduct which can be accomplished entirely within its own territory. If the compelled
conduct occurs in the United States, the Agencies will not recognize the defense.
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 For example, no defense arises when a foreign government requires the U.S. subsidiaries of several firms to organize
a cartel in the United States to fix the price at which products would be sold in the United States, or when it requires
its firms to fix mandatory resale prices for their U.S. distributors to use in the United States.

Third, with reference to the discussion of foreign sovereign immunity in Section 3.31 above, the order must come from
the foreign government acting in its governmental capacity. The defense does not arise from conduct that would fall
within the FSIA commercial activity exception.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Greatly increased quantities of commodity X have flooded into the world market over the last two or three years, including
substantial amounts indirectly coming into the United States. Because they are unsure whether they would prevail
in an antidumping and countervailing duty case, U.S. industry participants have refrained from filing trade law
petitions. The officials of three foreign countries meet with foreign firms and urge them to ``rationalize'' production
by cooperatively cutting back. The foreign firms agree among themselves to limit production, but there are governmental
penalties contemplated for a failure to do so.

As it presently stands, the act of state doctrine is a judge-made rule of federal common law.
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 It is a doctrine of judicial abstention based on considerations of international comity and separation of powers,
and applies only if the specific conduct complained of is a public act of the foreign sovereign within its territorial
jurisdiction on matters pertaining to its governmental sovereignty. The act of state doctrine arises when the validity
of the acts of a foreign government constitutes an unavoidable aspect of a case.
<FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>
 In such cases, courts have refused to adjudicate claims or issues that would require the court to judge the legality
(as a matter of U.S. law or international law) of the sovereign act of a foreign state.
<FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>
 Although in some cases the sovereign act in question may also compel private behavior, other situations may arise
in which the act imposes no such obligation.
<FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>
 While the act of state doctrine does not compel dismissal as a matter of course, abstention is appropriate in a case
where the court must ``declare invalid, and thus ineffective as a rule of decision in the U.S. courts,*&blank;*&blank;*
the official act of a foreign sovereign.''

When a restraint on competition arises directly from the act of a foreign sovereign, such as the grant of a license,
award of a contract, expropriation of property, or the like, the Agencies may refrain from bringing an enforcement
action based on the act of state doctrine. For example, the Agencies will not challenge foreign acts of state if the
facts and circumstances indicate that: (1) the specific conduct complained of is a public act of the sovereign, (2)
the act was taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the sovereign, and (3) the matter is governmental, rather
than commercial.

In the course of preparing an antidumping case, which requires the U.S. industry to demonstrate that it has been injured
through the effects of the dumped imports, producers representing 75% of U.S. output exchange the information required
for the adjudication. All the information is exchanged indirectly through third parties and in an aggregated form

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There has always been a close relationship between the international application of the antitrust laws and the policies
and rules governing the international trade of the United States. Restrictions such as tariffs or quotas on the free
flow of goods affect market definition, consumer choice, and supply options for U.S. producers. In certain instances,
the U.S. trade laws set forth specific procedures for settling disputes under those laws, which can involve price
and quantity agreements by the foreign firms involved. When those procedures are followed, an implied antitrust
immunity results.
<FOOTCITE>88</FOOTCITE>
 However, agreements among competitors that do not comply with the law, or go beyond the measures authorized by the
law, do not enjoy antitrust immunity. In the absence of legal authority, the fact, without more, that U.S. or foreign
government officials were involved in or encouraged measures that would otherwise violate the antitrust laws does
not immunize such arrangements.

Six U.S. producers of product Q have initiated an antidumping action alleging that imports of Q from country Sigma
at less than fair value are causing material injury to the U.S. Q industry. The ITC has made a preliminary decision that
there is a reasonable indication that the U.S. industry is suffering material injury from Q imported from Sigma. The
Department of Commerce has preliminarily concluded that the foreign market value of Q imported into the U.S. by Sigma's
Q producers exceeds the price at which they are selling Q in this country by margins of 10 to 40 percent. Sigma's Q producers
jointly initiate discussions with the Department of Commerce that lead to suspension of the investigation in accordance
with Section 734 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. &sect;1673c. The suspension agreement provides that each of Sigma's
Q producers will sell product Q in the United States at no less than its individual foreign market value, as determined
periodically by the Department of Commerce in accordance with the Tariff Act. Before determining to suspend the investigation,
the Department of Commerce provides copies of the proposed agreement to the U.S. Q producers, who jointly advise the
Department that they do not object to the suspension of the investigation on the terms proposed. The Department also
determines that suspension of the investigation was in the public interest. As a result of the suspension agreement,
prices in the United States of Q imported from Sigma rise by an average of 25 percent from the prices that prevailed before
the antidumping action was initiated.

The Export Association is a Webb-Pomerene association that has filed the appropriate certificates and reports with
the Commission. The Association exports a commodity to markets around the world, and fixes the price at which all of
its members sell the commodity in the foreign markets. Nearly 80% of all U.S. producers of the commodity belong to the
Association, and on a world-wide level, the Association's members account for approximately 40% of annual sales.

 The Webb-Pomerene Act addresses only the question of antitrust liability under U.S. law. Although the U.S. antitrust
laws confer an immunity on such associations, the Act does not purport to confer immunity under the law of any foreign
country, nor does the Act compel the members of a Webb-Pomerene association to act in any particular way. Thus, a foreign
government retains the ability to initiate proceedings if such an association allegedly violates that country's
competition law.

The Agencies will bring suit only if they conclude that personal jurisdiction exists under the due process clause
of the U.S. Constitution.
<FOOTCITE>90</FOOTCITE>
 Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;22, provides that any suit under the antitrust laws against a corporation
may be brought in the judicial district where it is an inhabitant, where it may be found, or where it transacts business.
The concept of transacting business is interpreted pragmatically by the Agencies. Thus, a company may transact business
in a particular district directly through an agent, or through a related corporation that is actually the ``alter
ego'' of the foreign party.
<FOOTCITE>91</FOOTCITE>
 In all cases, the assertion of personal jurisdiction must satisfy constitutional requirements of minimum contacts
with the United States, such that the proceeding comports with ``fair play and substantial justice.''

beyond the boundaries of the forum state, is the federal statute that authorizes service wherever the corporate defendant
transacts business. Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Elec. Co., Ltd., 885 F.2d 1406, 1414 (9th Cir. 1989). Under such a statute,
the question is whether the party has sufficient contacts with the United States, not any particular state.

In conducting investigations that require documents that are located outside the United States, or contacts with
persons located outside the United States, the Agencies first consider requests for voluntary cooperation when
practical and consistent with enforcement objectives. When compulsory measures are needed, they seek whenever
possible to work with foreign government involved. U.S. law also provides authority in some circumstances for the
use of compulsory measures directed to parties over whom the courts have personal jurisdiction, which the Agencies
may use when other efforts to obtain information have been exhausted or would be unavailing.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the OECD 1986 Recommendation, OECD countries notify one another when a proceeding such as a merger review is
underway that might affect the interests of other countries. Within the strict limits of national confidentiality
laws, agencies attempt to cooperate with one another in processing these reviews. This might extend to exchanges
of publicly available information, agreements to let the other agencies know when a decision to institute a proceeding
is taken, and to consult for purposes of international comity with respect to proposed remedial measures and investigatory
methods. The parties can facilitate faster resolution of these cases if they are willing voluntarily to waive confidentiality
protections and to cooperate with a joint investigation. At present neither U.S. law nor foreign laws permit effective
coordination of a single international investigation in the absence of such waivers.

Response of the United States to Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (the ``APPA''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b)&hyph;(h),
the United States hereby responds to public comments to the proposed Final Judgment submitted on May 25, 1994, for
entry in the civil antitrust action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action began on May 25, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that the Defendants violated Section
1 of the Sherman Act by maintaining and enforcing licenses and other agreements that unreasonably restrict the construction
and operation of float glass plants and the use and transfer of float glass process technology within the United States
and around the world. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Defendant Pilkington plc violated Section 2 of the Sherman
Act by wilfully acquiring and maintaining a monopoly in the world market for the design and construction of float glass
plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the same day, the United States and both Defendants filed with the Court, pursuant to Section 2(b) of the APPA, 15
U.S.C. &sect;16(b), a Stipulation submitting for entry a proposed Final Judgment, and a Competitive Impact Statement.
The proposed Final Judgment embodies the relief sought in the Complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 60-day period provided by Sections 2(b)&hyph;(d) of the APPA, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b)&hyph;(d), which
expired on September 1, 1994, the United States received three comments concerning the proposed Final Judgment.
The United States attaches hereto a copy of each comment and of each individual response that it made thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two of the comments were submitted by counsel for PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') and International Technologies
Consultants, Inc. (``ITC''), the respective plaintiffs in two civil actions against Defendant Pilkington plc 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
currently pending in this Court. The third comment was submitted on behalf of an unidentified client by a Minneapolis,
Minn. lawyer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PPG comment asserts that ``[w]hile the Proposed Final Judgment does make it more difficult for Pilkington to continue
these [trade-restraining] practices *&blank;*&blank;*. the public interest counsels modification or clarification''
thereof in accordance with eleven specific proposals. The ITC comment states that ``[t]he proposed decree represents
an important initial step in eradicating the obviously pernicious and indefensible license provisions, but unfortunately
it stops far short of providing the competitive relief required to definitively eradicate the Pilkington cartel
*&blank;*&blank;*'' and proposes two specific changes in it. Both comments quote press statements by Pilkington
in justification of their proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to both of these comments the United States initially points out that the sole issue currently under consideration
is whether it is in the public interest to enter the proposed Final Judgment submitted to the Court by stipulation.
Entry is in the public interest if the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged
in the Complaint.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ITC, a U.S.-based company that never had a Pilkington license and that has persistently but so far unsuccessfully
attempted to enter the float glass plant design and construction market, proposes to add a broad injunction against
Defendants' entering or enforcing any contract with a U.S.-based licensee that has the purpose or effect of inhibiting
market entry by U.S.-based non-licensees. PPG, a U.S.-based Pilkington licensee, proposes rendering null and void
all of the U.S.-based licensees' obligations under their respective Pilkington licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the United States agrees that Pilkington's continued efforts to hinder entry and to enforce geographic
and use restrictions against its U.S.-based licensees must be enjoined, and points out that the proposed Final Judgment
achieves those results, albeit with more specifically drawn injunctive provisions that those proposed in the comments.
Thus, Subparagraph IV.A. forbids Defendants to enforce license agreements with U.S.-based licensees insofar as
they contain any contractual limitations or any payment or confidentiality obligations with respect to any technology
that Pilkington disclosed to any U.S. licensee under its licensee agreement, subject to some narrow exceptions that
lack the potential for competitive harm. Analogously, Subparagraph IV.B. forbids Defendants to claim that persons
dealing with U.S.-based entities that have not been licensed by Pilkington are subject to liability under Pilkington's
exclusive rights to float glass know-how, unless such claims are in good faith based on technology that is a misappropriated
Pilkington trade secret specifically identified by Pilkington to the Department of Justice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other comments offered by ITC and PPG propose specific changes of language to the proposed Final Judgment. The
United States has considered each of these, and for the detailed reasons set forth in the attached individual letter
responses, explains why the public interest does not justify withdrawing its consent to entry of the proposed Final
Judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the third comment, Minneapolis, Minn. lawyer John A. Grimstad, Esq. proposed several changes to the Judgment out
of concern that they are necessary to protect the interest of his unidentified client, a domestic float glass producer
that acquired its technology by a route not fully explained in the comment, and is uncertain as to where it fits into
the Judgment's taxonomy of actual and potential technology users. Our individual response to Mr. Grimstad, appended
hereto, demonstrates that the Judgment fully protects his client's right to be free of anticompetitive interference
with its operations by Defendants, and that his proposed changes are therefore unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, the United States finds no basis in any of the Comments for concluding that the public interest would be served
by withdrawing its consent to entry of the proposed Final Judgment submitted to the Court by stipulation on May 25,
1994. and will request that the Court enter it forthwith.

In its ``Additional Comment,'' PPG states that these documents were recently produced to it ``on a restricted basis''
by Pilkington plc in CIV&hyph;92&hyph;753&hyph;TUC&hyph;WDB, a civil action between those parties pending in
this Court, and that, because of restrictions imposed by Pilkington, PPG can only submit the documents to the Court
under seal. PPG also states that, because of these Pilkington-imposed restrictions, it has not served copies of the
documents upon the Government. However, the Government's remarks herein concerning the ``Additional Comment''
have been prepared after counsel for Defendants, in response to the Government's request for copies of these documents,
furnished copies of them to Government counsel, albeit with the restriction that they ``are not for further distribution
outside the Department of Justice.''

Without suggesting that these Pilkington documents lack the probative value that PPG asserts, the Government finds
in them no reason to supplement its prior response to this suggestion. As stated in our individual response letter
to PPG's counsel, at 3, 5&hyph;6, the need for the proposed change is obviated by the provisons of Subparagraphs IV.A.
and IV.B., which respectively assure U.S.-based Pilkington licensees and U.S.-based non-licensees freedom to
export float glass from the United States to any point in the world.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') comments on the Proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States v. Pilkington plc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Preliminary Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pilkington has repeatedly brought vexatious litigation and has attempted to restrain trade under the guise of protecting
the confidentiality of float technology and enforcing license restrictions. While the Proposed Final Judgment
does make it more difficult for Pilkington to continue these practices, Pilkington has already publicly indicated
in its own press releases that it intends to continue engaging in such behavior to the degree that the consent decree
allows it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, on May 26, 1994, the Pilkington press release announcing the terms of this consent decree stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government's allegations are unproven and would not have survived a test in court. *&blank;*&blank;* The Consent
Decree *&blank;*&blank;* recognizes the subsequent evolution of [float] technology and that recent float bath
technology developed by Pilkington will continue to be treated through normal licensing arrangements. *&blank;*&blank;*
Pilkington's protection and licensing of its total float technology, throughout the rest of the world, remains unaffected.
*&blank;*&blank;* Pilkington is reassured that the confidentiality of the process is protected and that the normal
licensing arrangements for current and future float glass technology are secure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on Pilkington's own statements and to prevent continued vexations litigation and trade restraints, PPG submits
that protection of the public interest counsels modification or clarification of the Proposed Final Judgment in
the following limited respects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Float License Agreements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change: Paragraph IV.A.1. should be modified to provide: ``All obligations of U.S. LICENSEES in all LICENSE AGREEMENTS
between any defendant and any U.S. LICENSEE are hereby declared null, void and unenforceable. No defendant shall
take any action to invoke, enforce or assert any claim under any such agreement.'' Alternatively, at a minimum, paragraph
IV.A.1 should be modified to add: ``Moreover, no defendant shall enter into, enforce or claim any right under any AGREEMENT
to the extent that it requires any U.S. LICENSEE to: (i) Report and grant back to any defendant all improvement in FLOAT
TECHNOLOGY; (ii) limit exports of FLAT GLASS to any geographic areas; (iii) litigate disputes in an arbitration,
as opposed to a U.S. Court, unless such arbitration permits the application of substantive U.S. antitrust law, including
its provisions for treble damages and attorneys' fees awarded to a prevailing plaintiff; or (iv) prove that the SUBJECT
FLOAT TECHNOLOGY had become publicly known before being relieved of the territorial and use restrictions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The references in paragraphs IV.A.2.(b); IV.A.3; IV.B.1; IV.B.2(a); and IV.C to ``trade secret under applicable
law'' should be changed to ``trade secret under applicable law, provided that any applicable non-U.S. trade secret
law will not be applied to permit the protection of items of technology that would be unprotectable under U.S. law.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: As is set forth in the complaint in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States v. Pilkington plc,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CIV 94&hyph;00345&hyph;WDB (D. Ariz.) (the ``Complaint''), defendants have used float license agreements (``FLAs'')
to restrain trade and secure monopoly power unlawfully. The Competitive Impact Statement and the Complaint both
note that Pilkington has no intellectual property of substantial value, that, since 1982, Pilkington's remaining
secret unpatented technology consisted largely of engineering solutions with no substantial value over other equally
efficacious engineering alternatives and that one of the devices Pilkington has used to perpetuate its control is
its FLAs, including their burden-shifting clauses, which require licensees to establish the nonexistence of confidential
information in any arbitration. Competitive Impact Statement (``Comp. Imp. Stat.'') at 10; Complaint &sect;24.
If Pilkington is to be allowed to continue to protect its alleged trade secrets, it should be required to prove that
they exist. Pilkington should not be able to shift that burden of proof, as it has done in its FLAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pilkington's grant-back clauses require licensees to report and grant to Pilkington all improvements in float glass
technology. They thus deprive any licensee of the incentives to create innovative technologies, precluding any
competitive advantage to accrue to an innovative licensee and, in effect, discourage efforts to create such technologies.
The grant-back clauses should be invalidated for that reason.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pilkington also should be precluded from utilizing the FLA arbitration clauses to enforce so-called trade secret
claims. Those clauses have permitted Pilkington to assert claims in a forum that: (a) Is hostile to the application
of U.S. antitrust law; (b) does not recognize the extraterritorial application of U.S. antitrust law and may not recognize
even this Final Judgment; and (c) enforces anticompetitive restrictions not permissible under U.S. antitrust law.
Any issues involving U.S. trade secret law and U.S. antitrust .&blank;.&blank;. law should be litigated in a forum
that will permit an adjudication and award under those laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Assertion of Claims Against PPG With Respect to the Use or Licensing of the LB Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change: Change paragraph IV.A.1 to provide: ``with respect to the use, licensing or sublicensing of any SUBJECT FLOAT
TECHNOLOGY 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or any process developed with the use or aid of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.'' Paragraphs IV.A.2.(a) and IV.A.3 also
should be modified accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: In the Shenzhen Arbitration, which Pilkington filed in 1985 and which continued until 1992, Pilkington
asserted that PPG's LB process was ``tainted'' because it was developed using Pilkington float technology, irrespective
of whether PPG's use was wrongful. That ``taint,'' according to Pilkington, subjected the LB process as a whole to
an obligation of confidence coextensive with that applicable to information that was transferred by Pilkington
to PPG. The design and effect of Pilkington's ``taint'' argument was to make it virtually impossible for any licensee
to develop competing innovative technology free of Pilkington's aggressive claims and litigation, thus further
discouraging and inhibiting the development of innovative technologies by those most likely and able to engage in
such developmental efforts.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Although Pilkington's ``taint'' claim was rejected by the Shenzhen arbitrators, the language of the Proposed Final
Judgment does not clearly resolve the issue and may be used to revive Pilkington's anti-competitive claims. The ambiguity
may be easily remedied by amending the term ``Subject Float Technology'' to encompass technologies developed by
licensees whether or not developed with the use or aid of subject float technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Confidentiality Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Change: Paragraph IV.A.3.(b) should be changed to read: ``CONFIDENTIALITY of the transferred SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: The reference to FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (instead of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY) appears to be an oversight
because, as drafted, the provision would require licensees to protect the confidentiality of all float technology,
whatever its source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Litigation Commenced Before the Stipulation Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Change: Paragraph IV.A.4 should be deleted and paragraph IV.A.1 should be changed to ensure that Pilkington may not
enforce new unadjudicated claims arising under any FLA regardless of whether a proceeding was instituted prior to
the date of the stipulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: In August 1992, only two days after the High Court denied Pilkington leave to appeal from the award
in the Shenzhen Arbitration, Pilkington notified PPG of is intent to commence a new arbitration. Although a 1978 Settlement
Agreement between PPG and Pilkington explicitly permits PPG to use the LB process in Canada and Italy, Pilkington
now alleges that PPG's operation of its LB lines in those countries is not permitted because the width of the glass ribbons
in those lines has not always been ``from 70% to 90% of the constant spacing between the sidewalls,'' which Pilkington
argues is required under the Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that any variation in the width of the ribbons at
those lines does not implicate any Pilkington trade secrets or other intellectual-property interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States antitrust consent decrees commonly provide that the defendants are enjoined from any future enforcement
of anticompetitive restraints. However, paragraph IV.A.4 of the Proposed Final Judgment would permit Pilkington
to continue its monopolistic practices by pursuing its recently commenced arbitration proceedings against PPG
and its subsidiaries to punish PPG for its efforts to end Pilkington's monopolistic interference with United States
trade in the worldwide float technology market. No good reason exists why Pilkington's claims in those proceedings,
in which earnings have not yet commenced, should be exempted from the Proposed Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
5. Subsidiaries and Affiliates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Change: Paragraph II.Q should be changed to read: ``U.S. LICENSEE'' means any LICENSEE that was or is incorporated
in the United States, and shall include any subsidiaries, affiliates or parents of any such LICENSEE. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: As currently constituted, the Final Judgment offers no protection for subsidiaries and affiliates
of U.S. companies, although Pilkington's actions directed at such entities have had and could continue to have anticompetitive
effects in the United States. PPG and other U.S. competitors often participate in float glass manufacturing projects
outside the United States through joint ventures and through their non-U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates. The use
of U.S. licensees of subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates is often necessary to accommodate participation
of local investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because effective competition with Pilkington by U.S. Licensees will necessarily entail the use of subsidiaries
and affiliates in foreign countries, PPG's ability to participate in such ventures would be impaired (and U.S. commerce
thereby affected) if Pilkington were free to continue to enforce its monopolistic restrictions against these U.S.-related
entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
6. Protection of Flat Glass Exports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Change: Paragraph IV.D. should be changed to add ``or from'' to the caption after the word ``to'' and in the second line
of text after the word ``to.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: The Consent Decree should protect exports from the United States as well as imports to the United
States. Exports from the United States are part of the foreign commerce of the United States and Pilkington and its
subsidiaries and affiliates have engaged in a variety of exclusionary practices, unlawful under the United States
antitrust laws, intended to interfere with export of Float Glass from the United States into, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Australia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Perpetual Confidentiality Obligations Should Not Revive Upon the Expiration of This Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change: Paragraph VII.(A) should be changed to provide: ``Other than the provisions of paragraphs IV.A. and B., which
provisions shall remain in effect permanently, this Final Judgment shall expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<PARENT> FR941019-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reason for Change: The ten-year expiration of the Final Judgment should not leave open an argument that the otherwise
perpetual confidentiality obligations of Pilkington's FLAs somehow revive upon its expiration, as provided in
VII(A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Pilkington Should Not Be Able To Assert U.S. Trade Secret Rights Against Any U.S. Licensee or Non-Licensee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change: Paragraph IV.A.2 should be changed to read: ``No defendant shall assert against any U.S. LICENSEE any proprietary
FLOAT TECHNOLOGY know-how rights that it may have or claim with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: Paragraph 24 of the DOJ Complaint states that ``Pilkington's maintenance and continued enforcement
of the licensee restraints described above was not justified by any intellectual property rights of substantial
value.'' Pilkington's core float glass technology was disclosed in numerous patents that have long expired, placing
that technology in the public domain. Moreover, unpatented Pilkington float glass technology has been publicly
disclosed in substantial part. The Department of Justice has determined that the remaining secret unpatented technology
consists largely of ``engineering solutions with no substantial value over other, equally efficacious engineering
alternatives.'' Complaint &para;24. Moreover, Attorney General Reno, in announcing the consent decree, said that
``Pilkington had agreed that much of its technology is in the public domain.'' ``British Company Agrees to Settle
Justice Department Antitrust Suit,'' New York Times, p. 1, May 27, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If Pilkinton no longer holds intellectual property of substantial value, there is no reason why it should be allowed
to assert trade secret rights against any United States licensee or United States non-licensee with respect to any
Float Technology in existence as of the date of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forfeiture of patent rights is a common remedy for the abuse of patent rights giving rise to antitrust violations and
there is no reason that that remedy should not be applied to Pilkington's abuse of its alleged trade secret rights,
particularly in view of the Department's view that its technical information is without redeeming value. Comp. Imp.
Stat. at 10; Complaint &para; 26. Given Pilkington's demonstrated propensity to pursue its monopolistic practices
through unjustified assertions of propriety trade secret rights and given the trivial nature of Pilkington's claimed
``trade secrets,'' there is no sufficient justification for allowing Pilkington to retain these weapons empowering
it to use threats and litigation based on asserted trade secrets to continue to its monopolistic practices. Paragraph
IV.A.2 should be modified accordingly. This suggested change is not meant to prevent Pilkington from seeking to protect
any bona fide trade secrets developed after the date of entry of this Final Judgment.

9. As An Alternative, Pilkington Should be Barred From Asserting Any Trade Secret Rights Based on Information in Existence
Prior to December 31, 1982 and Identify Any Other Trade Secrets on the Basis of Which Pilkington Imposes Any Restraint
of Trade
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change: Paragraph IV.A.2 should be changed to read: ``No defendant shall assert against any U.S. LICENSEE OR U.S.
NON-LICENSEE any proprietary FLOAT TECHNOLOGY know-how rights based on information in existence prior to December
31, 1982, the date referred to in &para;26 of the Complaint. Within sixty (60) days of entry of this Final Judgment,
Pilkington shall identify and specifically describe any trade secrets developed after December 31, 1982, which
it claims may justify a restraint of trade to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division; and identify such trade
secret to all U.S. LICENSEES and to all U.S. NON-LICENSEES who shall request the same in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: Should the Department believe it inappropriate to bar defendants from asserting any trade secrets
in existence as of the date of the Final Judgment, the Department should at least bar defendants from imposing restraints
of trade based on technical information in existence prior to December 31, 1982, and require defendants to identify
and specifically describe any trade secret developed after December 31, 1982, which any defendant may claim justifies
a restraint of trade, to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division; and identify such trade secret to any U.S.
LICENSEE and any U.S. NON-LICENSEE who requests the same.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such relief is minimally necessary to prevent defendants from continuing to rely on stale claims of trade secrets
and refusing to disclose with reasonable specificity any trade secret created after December 31, 1982, upon which
it may seek to impose a restraint of trade. Without such relief, defendants will be enabled to continue their past practice
of threatening their competitors with litigation based on some ambiguous assertion of trade secret rights. Defendants'
public announcements make it clear that they intend to continue the assertion of some unidentified body of trade secrets,
notwithstanding the Final Judgment. (See pp. 1&hyph;2 above.)

10. Justice Department Scrutiny of Litigation Brought by Pilkington
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change: Alternatively, paragraph IV.A.2(b) should be changed to add subparagraphs (iii) and (iv):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) defendant has, within fourteen (14) days after any such assertion:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) made a showing in writing to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division in support of the arguments described
in subparagraphs 2(b)(i) and 2(b)(ii), above;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) identified, enumerated, and described such item or combination of items (in sufficient detail and with sufficient
clarity to distinguish them from information not a trade secret under applicable law) on a list submitted to the Antitrust
Division and to the U.S. LICENSEE against whom such right is asserted; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) such U.S. LICENSEE is unwilling to make lawful and commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the CONFIDENTIALITY
of any such item or combination of items for which it has received actual notice of a defendant's claim of proprietary
rights therein pursuant to subparagraph 2(iii)(b), above, and for which a defendant has made the requisite showing
pursuant to subparagraph 2(iii)(a), above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reason for Change: The change is necessary to provide for the same scrutiny for Pilkington suits against licensees
as is provided for suits against non-licensees (as is set forth in paragraph IV.B.2(c)). No adequate justification
exists for discriminating against licensees, especially given that competition has been stultified principally
through use of Pilkington's licensing scheme.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change: Paragraph IV.G.1. should be changed to replace ``public knowledge in the FINAL AWARD'' with ``public knowledge
found to have been such or otherwise found to be not an enforceable trade secret in the FINAL AWARD or in any other prior
proceeding&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;'' Paragraph IV.G.2(b) also should be modified accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph IV.G.2 also should be changed to replace ``public domain'' in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) with ``public
knowledge or otherwise not a trade secret'' in each subparagraph.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reason for Change: The present formulation does not account for unenforceability arising from anything other than
the public disclosure of trade secret information. Information that is claimed as a trade secret also may not be enforceable
if it is readily ascertainable or had not been the subject of adequate precautions to preserve confidentiality. The
change also gives effect to all proceedings to which information alleged to be confidential by Pilkington has been
held to have been publicly disclosed or with respect to which Pilkington's rights have been held unenforceable for
any reason.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pilkington plc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph IV.D of the proposed Final Judgment provides that ``[n]o defendant, with the intent of restraining or limiting
the amount of exports of FLOAT GLASS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the United States [etc.]''. We have suggested [Comments at 8] that the paragraph should be changed to add ``or from''
after the word ``to.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Enclosed are documents recently produced by Pilkington in the suit by PPG Industries against Pilkington in the District
of Arizona (No. CIV&hyph;92&hyph;753&hyph;TUC&hyph;WDB). Those documents demonstrate the need for the suggested
change. They show, we believe, that Pilkington's conduct, as alleged in the U.S. complaint and in PPG's complaint,
is designed to foreclose PPG and other American manufacturers from competing with Pilkington in the construction
of new plants in foreign countries and, as well, in the export of glass from the United States to those foreign countries.
They suggest that such exclusionary conduct is continuing to the present day. The documents are filed under seal because
they were produced to us on a restricted basis. We therefore suggest that the Court should seek from Pilkington a statement
of the reasonable terms and conditions under which the Court may inspect the documents and obtain comments thereon
from counsel appearing for the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dear Messrs. Brown and Barr: This letter responds to the Comments of PPG Industries, Inc. [``PPG''] on Proposed Final
Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(``Comments'') submitted to the Antitrust Division over your names on August 13, 1994. The Comments include a ``Preliminary
Statement'' that summarizes certain representations by Defendants to the press that, in your words, indicate that
``Pilkington *&blank;*&blank;* intends to continue engaging in [its prior anticompetitive] behavior to the degree
that the consent decree allows it.'' You further assert that ``[b]ased on Pilkington's own statements *&blank;*&blank;*
protection of the public interest counsels modification or clarification of the Proposed Final Judgment'' in eleven
specific ways.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before addressing your eleven specific proposed changes, we would point out that the text of the proposed Final Judgment
(``Judgment''), rather than Pilkington's characterization thereof in its own press releases, controls what it
will be permitted
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
and required to do. Thus, contrary to Pilkington's public claim, which you quote, that the restraints Pilkington
has imposed under the guise of ``protection and licensing of its total float technology, throughout the rest of the
world, remain unaffected,'' the Judgment will in fact enjoin Pilkington from anticompetitive practices 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
throughout the world 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
to the extent that those practices are aimed at U.S.-based entities seeking to use float technology anywhere, or are
aimed at anyone else seeking to use float technology in North America. That is, Pilkington's specified anticompetitive
conduct is enjoined insofar as it is within the jurisdiction of the U.S. antitrust laws. The competitive effect of
Pilkington's ability, also referred to in the portion of Pilkington's press release that you quote, to acquire ``normal
licensing'' of its ``recent float bath technology,'' must be considered in the light of its ready concession to the
United States during settlement negotiations that very little significant technology of that kind exists. A good
measure of the near-absence of such significant recent technology, as you must certainly realize, in that float glass
manufactured in this country by PPG and others who have not been licensed to use this ``recent technology'' has been
quite competitive with Pilkington's subsidiary's production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard we have applied in assessing your eleven specific proposals for modification or clarification is whether
it is in the public interest to enter the Judgment that has been submitted for entry by stipulation. Entry is in the public
interest if the Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint.

1. You propose, in the alternative, to change subparagraph IV.A.1 of the Judgment to provide that all obligations
of U.S. LICENSEES
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 under all LICENSE AGREEMENTS are declared null, void, and unenforceable, or alternatively ``at a minimum'' to make
four specific changes in that paragraph. As to your first proposed alternative, the Department of Justice does not
agree that it is in the public interest to withhold entry of the Judgment on the ground that it does not totally render
these agreements null, void, and unenforceable. We believe, rather, that the existing provisions of subparagraph
IV.A. protect the interest of the public by restoring competition and remedying the violation with regard to the ability
of U.S. LICENSEES to compete freely in float glass process technology and float glass markets. In that regard, we would
point out that in the Complaint in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
PPG Industries, Inc. v. Pilkington plc et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, Civil Action CIV 92&hyph;753 TUC WDB (D. Ariz.) the relief you seek is for the Court to declare null, void, and unenforceable
only ``the anticompetitive restraints in the Pilkington license agreements,'' and not the agreements themselves,
relief that is essentially like that provided in the Judgment rather than that which now you propose.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the above, you make a four-part proposal, to which we have the following responses:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /STAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The first part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to report or grant back rights to FLOAT TECHNOLOGY improvements.
Inasmuch as all such improvement reporting and grant-back provisions in licenses to U.S. LICENSEES expired long
ago, this proposes an unnecessary addition to the provision of the Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The second part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to limit exports of FLAT GLASS to any geographic areas. We note
that Defendants have not imposed express contractual restraints upon the export of glass from the United States by
PPG nor by any other U.S. LICENSEE. Nevertheless, there have been instances when defendants relied upon their patents
in the destination countries to limit or prevent such exports when the U.S. LICENSEE was unable to persuade Defendants
to grant or sell a full waiver of those foreign patent rights. The patents on which Defendants relied for this purpose,
however, have now expired along with their counterpart U.S. patents, denying them the means to carry on this form of
export restraint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The third part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to arbitrate rather than litigate disputes unless substantive
U.S. antitrust law is applied. The Judgment will foreclose most such disputes in the future by the prohibitions and
conditions that it places on Defendants' ability to require U.S. LICENSEES to pay FEES, observe LIMITATIONS, or maintain
CONFIDENTIALITY with respect to the use or sublicensing of any SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. Moreover, even prior to
the entry of any judgment herein PPG has obtained the very result that this request seeks. Specifically, we refer to
Judge Browning's finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That arbitration *&blank;*&blank;* will not operate as a prospective waiver of PPG's statutory claims due to Pilkington's
express representation and consent to the substantive arbitration or PPG's claims pursuant to U.S. antitrust law.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) The fourth part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to bear the burden of proving that SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY
has become publicly known before being relieved of territorial and use restrictions. Subparagraph IV.A. accomplishes
precisely that result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. You propose to expand the coverage of subparagraph IV.A.1. to include processes developed with the use or aid of
SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY so as to preclude Defendants' future reassertion of arguments that technology developed
in minds ``tainted'' by prior knowledge of Pilkington technology also belongs to Pilkington. However, the Judgment
precludes Defendants from making such assertions. Any ``taint'' claim by Defendants is enjoined by subparagraph
IV.A.1., inasmuch as it would ``require *&blank;*&blank;* any U.S. LICENSEE to *&blank;*&blank;* observe LIMITATIONS,''
LIMITATIONS being defined in subparagraph II.K. as including ``any restriction or limitation, or purported restriction
or limitation, of the use of FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, whether the result of an affirmative prohibition or a limited authorization.''
In the discussions leading to the Stipulation to submit the Judgment to the Court for entry, Defendants' representatives
repeatedly acknowledged to the Department that the taint issue had been resolved against Pilkington in the ``Shenzhen''
arbitration (a point you also make in your comment) and in subsequent judicial review thereof, and that they considered
this a final determination precluding them from again asserting ``taint'' against your client.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. You propose limiting IV.A.3.(b) by adding the word ``SUBJECT'' just before the words ``FLOAT TECHNOLOGY,'' stating
that we appear to have omitted the word by oversight. Contrary to your assumption, however, the text of this provision
intentionally covers all FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. By omitting the word that your proposal would add, this provision protects
against future Pilkington misappropriation charges any U.S. LICENSEE who transfers any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (e.g.,
in connection with building a float glass plant abroad). This protection will cover not only charges of misappropriating
SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, i.e., FLOAT TECHNOLOGY disclosed to the U.S. LICENSEE under its LICENSE AGREEMENT, but
also FLOAT TECHNOLOGY that found its way to the U.S. LICENSEE via a third party (e.g., by hiring a former Pilkington
employee) as long as the U.S. LICENSEE, when transferring such technology, includes in the agreement of transfer
``a lawful and commercially reasonable provision requiring the transferee to maintain CONFIDENTIALITY.'' Such
confidentiality provisions are customarily included in technology transfer agreements, so that this provision
imposes no significant burden on U.S. LICENSEES, while protecting them against such claims by Pilkington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. You propose deleting subparagraph IV.A.4. and changing subparagraph IV.A.1. to ensure Pilkington cannot pursue
monetary relief in proceedings regardless of when they were instituted, pointing out that in 1992 Pilkington instituted
an additional arbitration proceeding against PPG on a claim growing out of a 1978 settlement concerning LB technology.
Subparagraphs A.1. and A.2. of the Judgment enjoin Defendants' further pursuit of injunctive and declaratory relief
against U.S. LICENSEES' ``violations'' of license restrictions. Subparagraph IV.A.4. creates a narrow exception
that permits Defendants to continue to pursue solely monetary (but not injunctive or declaratory) relief, but only
for past conduct, and only in proceedings instituted before May 25, 1994. Your comment indicates that your concern
about this exception is raised by a single dispute that Pilkington initiated in 1992, one that arose out of a 1978 settlement
of an earlier litigated dispute. The Department of Justice's role in this civil Sherman Act case extends to securing
prospective relief that assures open competition for the benefit of the public. ``[T]he antitrust laws *&blank;*&blank;*
were enacted `for the protection of competition, not competitors,'''

obtained equitable relief but also from the imposition of FEES, as defined in subparagraph II.C., for the prospective
use or sublicensing of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. Contrarily, the claim to which you allude is limited strictly to
monetary relief for your client for past conduct. Thus, no matter how ill-founded or unjust this Pilkington monetary
claim against PPG may be, its assertion is a private matter and consequently concerns only the private parties involved.

5. You propose including within the definition of U.S. LICENSEE (subparagraph II.Q.) the licensees' subsidiaries,
affiliates, and parents, pointing out that participation by U.S. LICENSEES in off-shore float glass manufacturing
projects is often likely to occur through their subsidiaries or affiliates. While this is undoubtedly correct, such
subsidiaries or affiliates participate in such projects under sublicenses granted to them by their respective U.S.
LICENSEE parents or affiliates. Your proposal is unnecessary since subparagraph IV.A. of the Judgment expressly
enjoins Defendants from conduct interfering with U.S. LICENSEES' sublicensing activities to the same extent as
it enjoins interfering with their use of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. It may be noted that, in the course of discussions
leading to the Stipulation to submit the Judgment to the Court, Pilkington's representatives acknowledged that
under the Judgment U.S. LICENSEES will be free, through subsidiaries or affiliates, to participate in the design,
construction, and operation of overseas float glass plants such as the Shenzhen plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. You propose broadening the injunctive provisions of subparagraph IV.D., which deal with exports of float glass
from abroad into the United States, to cover exports of float glass from the United States as well. Subparagraph IV.A.
leaves U.S. LICENSEES free to export float glass from this country. Subparagraph IV.B. analogously protects U.S.
NON-LICENSEES from interference with their export of float glass from this country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. You propose that the injunctive provisions of subparagraphs IV.A. and IV.B. be made perpetual by exempting them
from the ten-year Judgment duration provision of subparagraph VII.A. because, in your words, the ``Judgment should
not leave open an argument that otherwise perpetual confidentiality obligations'' revive upon the Judgment's expiration.
Trade secrecy obligations are, of course, never perpetual; they last only while the information to which they pertain
has value and is not public. As set forth in Paragraph 24 of our Complaint, the SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, all of which
had been communicated by Pilkington to U.S. LICENSEES by no later than 1982, no longer has substantial value. The prospect
that Defendants would be able to resume interfering with open competition by assertions of confidentiality for the,
by then, even more highly superannuated technology, especially in view of the pro-competitive effects that this
Judgment can be expected to confer during the next decade, are too remote to justify your proposal. Consequently,
the Department does not consider such a change necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. You propose, in effect, to remove the exceptions to the injunction in Subparagraph IV.A.2. against Defendants'
asserting know-how rights against U.S. LICENSEES with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY on the ground that we have determined
that Pilkington's core float glass technology currently lacks substantial value. We continue strongly to believe
that this assessment of the value of Pilkington's technology is correct, of course. For that reason, Subparagraph
IV.A.2.(a) enjoins Defendants from asserting against all U.S. LICENSEES that are not subsidiaries of Defendants
any proprietary claims as to the FLOAT TECHNOLOGY disclosed to the licensees under the license agreement (except
for the reservation in Subparagraph IV.A.4. of money damage claims for past conduct that, as has already been discussed
in Item 4, above, does not affect the public interest). In addition, Subparagraph IV.A.2.(b) enjoins Defendants
from asserting any proprietary claims against such licensees as to other FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, (i.e., technology that
the licensee did not obtain under the license but that Defendants nevertheless claim is theirs, unless the claim is
based on a good faith argument that the technology in question is a legally cognizable trade secret and that it was unlawfully
acquired). Subparagraph IV.A.2. therefore properly protects U.S. LICENSEES from unjustified assertions of know-how
rights by Defendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. You propose, as an alternative to your Proposal No. 8, changes to the language of Subparagraph IV.A.2. that would
categorically bar Defendants' assertion against U.S. LICENSEES of (1) rights in pre-1983 know-how and (2) trade
secrets developed after that date that a Defendant, in your words, ``claims may justify a restraint of trade,'' unless
such trade secrets have been disclosed to the Department and to all U.S. LICENSEES and U.S. NON-LICENSEES who request
it. You state that without such a provision Defendants will be able to continue to threaten competitors with ambiguous
assertions of trade secret rights. We agree that it is important that Defendants be prevented from continuing such
illegal conduct, but are certain that the Judgment will enjoin it. Subparagraph IV.A.2. absolutely bars Defendants
from making such claims against U.S. LICENSEES with respect to SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (which in view of the already-discussed
1982 cut-off of improvement disclosures to all U.S. LICENSEES refers to pre-1983 technology), and limits such assertion
by Defendants, when dealing with other FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, to instances where they have good faith arguments that they
are asserting rights to subject matter that qualifies as legally recognized trade secrets and also that the U.S. LICENSEE
in question has obtained the subject matter unlawfully. Subparagraph IV.B.2. similarly protects U.S. NON-LICENSEES
from such future conduct. Given the protection afforded by subparagraphs IV.A.2. and IV.B.2., the additional disclosure
requirements are unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. You propose to add to subparagraph IV.A.2. requirements that Defendants must satisfy before asserting know-how
rights against U.S. LICENSEES that are as exacting as the subparagraph IV.B.2. requirements that apply when Defendants
assert such claims against U.S. NON-LICENSEES. Although it may initially seem appropriate to impose the same requirements
on Pilkington regardless of whether it asserts such alleged rights against U.S. LICENSEES or U.S. NON-LICENSEES,
the differences in how the two groups gain access to Pilkington technology provides the basis for imposing different
requirements in the two situations. U.S. LICENSEES originally obtained the SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY under their
respective licenses, an information flow, as we have already noted herein, that ended in 1982. Subparagraph IV.A.2.(a)
absolutely bars Defendants' claims against U.S. LICENSEES based on such old technology; thus, Defendants would
have to establish that any claim they make against a U.S. LICENSEE not only meets the requirements of subparagraphs
IV.A.2.(b) but also that the technology in question was obtained by the U.S. LICENSEE after 1982. The requirement
for such a showing substantially diminishes the need for the kind of additional showing in claims against U.S. LICENSEES
that you propose. By contrast, claims that Defendants might make against U.S. NON-LICENSEES could cover pre-1983
technology as well as that of later origin, making the provisions of IV.B.2. (c) and (d) far more important as safeguards
against anticompetitive assertions of such know-how rights.

11. Finally, you propose to extend Defendants' obligation pursuant to subparagraph IV.G.1. to identify the FLOAT
TECHNOLOGY found to be public knowledge in the FINAL AWARD entered in the Shenzhen arbitration so that it also requires
such identification for material ``otherwise found not to be a trade secret in the FINAL AWARD or in any other proceeding.''
You further propose a similar change for subparagraph IV.G.2(b). Such changes would be counterproductive. Contrary
to loose assertions made on Defendants' behalf that the Shenzhen arbitrators determined what Pilkington technology
still merits trade secret status, they made no such determination but rather determined only that certain items had
not been proven to be in the public domain. There is no basis in law for the assertion implied by the proposed change,
i.e., that any subject matter not in the public domain is entitled to trade secret protection. Such a formulation would
ignore, inter alia, the requirement that alleged trade secrets must have value to merit legal or equitable protection.
PPG, having been a party to this arbitration, already knows what this provision of the Judgment requires Defendants
to disclose; it is thus primarily for the benefit of PPG's competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons noted above the Department of Justice does not believe that it would be in the public interest to forego
entry of the Judgment for failure to incorporate any of your proposed changes. We nevertheless greatly appreciate
your interest in this matter.

Preliminary Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ITC, in the parlance of the proposed final decree, is a U.S. NON-LICENSEE. ITC competes in the sale of float process
technology on a worldwide basis, using float technology which it independently developed from information in the
public domain, supplemented by sound engineering practice and extensive expertise in the construction of float
process facilities. ITC is not, nor has it ever been, a Pilkington licensee. ITC's business activities are confined
to the worldwide marketing of float process technology and associated engineering and technical services. ITC has
no involvement in the production or distribution of manufactured glass.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The government complaint, proposed decree and the competitive impact statement evolved from a CID investigation
of the license arrangements between Pilkington and its licensees, the principal focus of which was the variety of
license provisions utilized by Pilkington illegitimately to perpetuate its patent monopoly of float process technology.
(See complaint, &para;&blank;27.) The Department's conclusion that the Pilkington licensing scheme constitutes
an illegal effort to perpetuate and maintain its monopoly far beyond the expiration of the core float process patents
and its consequent decision to confront this deeply entrenched, aggressive foreign-based cartel is to be commended.
The proposed decree represents an important initial step in eradicating the obviously pernicious and indefensible
license provisions, but unfortunately it stops far short of providing the competitive relief required to definitely
eradicate the Pilkington cartel, thereby finally permitting a competitive environment to exist in the flat glass
industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need to revisit and rethink the efficacy of the proposed decree with a view to tightening its provisions was amply
demonstrated by the reaction of senior Pilkington officials to the filing of the litigation. The company's May 26,
1994 press release dismisses the government case as unprovable, and unworthy of the cost and time required to achieve
judicial vindication. The Release then describes the official Pilkington interpretation of the decree as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Consent Decree&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;recognizes the subsequent evolution of float technologies
and that some recent float bath technology developed by Pilkington will continue to be treated through normal licensing
arrangements. Pilkington's protection and licensing of its total float technology throughout the rest of the world,
remains unaffected.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;Pilkington is reassured that the confidentiality of the
processes is protected and that the normal licensing arrangements for current and future float glass technology
are secure.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These comments must be read against the evidentiary record developed by the Division via its CID investigation which
unambiguously demonstrates that Pilkington deliberately, and with full knowledge of the illegality of its actions
under United States antitrust law, proceeded to adopt and aggressively implement its illegal licensing scheme in
order to shore up its monopoly position to combat the erosion of its patent base. Given its longstanding distaste for
antitrust law as enforced in the United States (a common malady among British corporate officials), which continues
unabated as evidenced by the above referenced reaction of its senior officials to the instant litigation, common
sense and prudence dictates that the Department must take unusual precautions to ensure that the substantial time
and public monies expended in the investigation and prosecution of this worldwide cartel translates into lasting
and meaningful pro-competitive results.

Because ITC is a U.S. NON-LICENSEE, its specific comments relative to the proposed decree reflect its perspective
as one as one of the few non-Pilkington licensees to make a sustained effort to enter the float process design market
in competition with Pilkington and its licensees. ITC defers to the U.S. LICENSEES in respect of the efficacy of the
proposed decree in addressing the anti-competitive license provisions of particular concern to them.

Part B_Litigation of the Competitive Impact Statement (``CIS'') at pp. 12 and 13 describes the litigation by Pilkington
against AFG and Guardian, respectively, to prevent them from violating the territorial provisions of their respective
licenses with Pilkington, thereby eliminating (or at least carefully controlling) competition between each of
them and Pilkington. The CIS alludes to the fact that both cases were settled on the basis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that each licensee defendant would abandon its aggressive competition with Pilkington, thereby preserving the
Pilkington cartel against uncontrolled competition from its own licensees.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Significantly, the CIS omits any mention of another important element of the aforesaid settlement, namely agreements
with each such defendant licensee to cooperate (conspire) with Pilkington to forestall the emerging competition
from non-licensees which threatened to undermine the Pilkington cartel by entering the float process technology
market and ending the cartel's control over both the production and sale of flat glass.

PPG thus remained the sole Pilkington licensee to persist in an effort to become an independent competitive factor

ITC recognizes that the Department opted to file suit against Pilkington before it had proceeded very far with its
broader investigation of the above-described collusive conduct among Pilkington and various key licensees designed
to protect the cartel against the entry of NON-LICENSEE competitors over whom the cartel would have no control. Through
discovery undertaken largely subsequent to the filing of the government suit, ITC gained access to and reviewed many
of the documents previously submitted to the Department in response to the CIDs. The CID documents pertaining to the
conspiracy issue deeply implicate two of the U.S. LICENSEES_AFG and Guardian_who are principal beneficiaries of
the proposed decree, along with various other U.S. NON-LICENSEES. This documentary record is sufficiently compelling
that in the normal course the Division would have been expected to proceed with CID depositions and otherwise aggressively
pursue the investigation. In our view, had the Division completed the comprehensive formal investigation justified
by the evidence in its possession before filing its complaint, not only would there have been a broader complaint involving
more parties, but the proposed decree would of necessity have been much more comprehensive. As it is, ITC must now secure
relief against this broad conspiratorial conduct through its own litigation efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be that as it may, the complaint and proposed decree as filed nonetheless represents an important first step in a long
overdue attack upon longstanding anti-competitive license provisions which Pilkington used in its increasing
futile effort to prop up its monopoly position vis-&agrave;-vis its own licensees as its key patents expired. As noted,
the principal beneficiaries of the lawsuit and the decree as currently structured are the U.S. LICENSEES who have
finally achieved an important measure of freedom to engage in meaningful competition with Pilkington. However,
neither the complaint nor the proposed decree displays any understanding of the critically important competitive
role played by the U.S. NON-LICENSEES, nor does the decree contain provisions essential to enable U.S. NON-LICENSEES
to freely enter and compete in the float process technology market, thereby achieving an even broader pro-competitive
effect. It is, in short, all well and good for the government to take action which permits AFG, Guardian and other U.S.
LICENSEES to free themselves from the anti-competitive constraints central to the Pilkington licensing scheme.
However, U.S. NON-LICENSEES also have a right to expect their government to protect them from blatantly anti-competitive
conduct undertaken by certain U.S. LICENSEES, albeit at the insistence of a foreign cartel manager desperate to protect
itself against the competitive in-roads of NON-LICENSEE competitors. Indeed, one would expect that the Department
would have a particularly acute interest, not to mention a solemn obligation, to ensure that, at the very least, Pilkington
is enjoined from enforcing or implementing any agreements or understandings extracted from any of its Licensees
as a condition to the settlement of litigation it initiated. Further, given what the evidence in the government's
possession reveals, it is incumbent upon the Department to take corrective action to eliminate the remaining barriers
to entry by U.S. NON-LICENSEES, thereby finally achieving and creating a truly competitive marketplace.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For decades Pilkington has been highly successful in discouraging prospective clients from dealing with U.S. NON-LICENSEES
simply by asserting that Pilkington had been the first to develop float process technology and thus had the exclusive
worldwide right to use or license that technology, and that for anyone to secure such technology from non-Pilkington
sources was to invite litigation. This mantra has been repeated so often and so categorically by Pilkington and its
allies that at this point in time many potential clients simply accept the primacy of Pilkington in float process-technology
as an immutable given_baseless though it may be. This pattern of Pilkington conduct_fraudulent claims of exclusivity
and confidentiality, accompanied by threats of litigation (should the use of non-Pilkington float process technology
be contemplated) to prospective customers, competing sources of technology and float technology and sources of
capital, materials and supplies, has continued at least through the spring of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given this unbroken record of illegal conduct, the resulting deeply entrenched cartel, and the substantial economic
harm caused thereby, it is obvious that the relief proposed in Section IV.B.2 of the proposed decree falls woefully
short of the mark. In the first place, defendants having such a record of illegal conduct are hardly entitled to any
benefit of the doubt regarding their alleged good faith in asserting proprietary float technology know-how rights
and claims of confidentiality; to the contrary, the burden of proof regarding such assertions must necessarily rest
upon Pilkington, rather than upon the victims of its repeated acts of illegality. Indeed, as proposed, the decree
language invites precisely the sort of protracted exercise which places prospective new entrants at a fatal disadvantage.
Further, the decree must contain a mechanism for fairly, quickly and effectively resolving any disputes regarding
proprietary know-how or confidentiality in a neutral setting, and defendants must be enjoined from making any assertions
regarding know-how rights and confidentiality unless and until their position is vindicated through the dispute
resolution mechanism.

2. No defendant shall assert against U.S. NON-LICENSEES (other than in respect of Agreements referred to in subparagraph
B.1. above) any alleged proprietary FLOAT TECHNOLOGY Know-how rights (including any claim of Confidentiality)
that it or any U.S. LICENSEE claims to have with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY offered by U.S. NON-LICENSEES anywhere
in the world, or communicate to third parties regarding any such assertions or claims, unless for each such claim the
following occurs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Defendants shall have the burden of describing in writing with specificity the item of float technology covered

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2d. unless the matter is resolved via negotiations between or among the defendants and the U.S. NON-LICENSEES within
five (5) days, the court shall appoint a special master knowledgeable in float technology to conduct an inquiry to
determine whether defendants have met their burden, and will promptly file a written report and recommendation to
the court;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. the court will enter an appropriate order;

ITC recognizes that such a dispute resolution mechanism has a regulatory flavor and that the Department often disfavors
regulatory decrees. However, several factors militate strongly in favor of such an approach in the unique circumstances
here presented. First, the proposed truth seeking process would be triggered at the earliest stage of the dispute,
before the invariably corrosive and damaging false accusations circulate among prospective clients, sources of
financial support and suppliers. A somewhat similar approach proved potentially useful in evaluating Guardian's
trade secrets claims against ITC and Euroglas. Procedural ambiguities, confusion about the format and Guardian's
reluctance to participate at the critical early stage in the process substantially compromised the proceeding,
but all such potential problems have been eliminated from the mechanism proposed above. The clean bill of health ultimately
achieved by ITC in the Euroglas situation unfortunately had little practical effect because Guardian had had a year
to fraudulently disparage the ITC design before the report was issued. This difficulty is avoided in the proposed
mechanism by enjoining Pilkington from making such characterizations until and unless it had met its burden of proof,
which both creates an incentive for Pilkington to cooperate in seeking an early resolution of the dispute and prevents
the circulation of fraudulent assertions until the process has been completed.

Second, there is little danger that the court and the parties will be inundated by a flood of hypertechnical disputes
about know-how and confidentiality claims. Once the burden of proof is placed upon Pilkington_where it obviously
belongs, coupled with the requirement that a detailed specification of the basis of the claim be prepared and shared
with the accused party, the era of generalized and vague allegations of impropriety and veiled threats of litigation
will finally end. Indeed, there is every likelihood that the dispute resolution mechanism would need to be used perhaps
only once, to initially and definitively clear the air regarding the usual litany of Pilkington allegations of impropriety
by U.S. NON-LICENSEES. Once the U.S. NON-LICENSEE passed its initial litmus test, there is little likelihood that
Pilkington would have much stomach for insisting upon rematches, and the U.S. NON-LICENSEE would be free to immediately
enter the market place and would do so. Apart from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sui generis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Muliaglass situation, the Pilkington cartel, aided by various U.S. LICENSEES and others, has succeeded in preventing
every effort by U.S. NON-LICENSEES from entering the float process technology market, all of which entrenches the
myth that Pilkington, by virtue of divine right, is the exclusive worldwide source of such technology. In sum, once
the Pilkington canards about know-how rights and confidentiality are exposed for the empty shells they are, as ITC
is confident they would be by the proposed procedure, the walls of the cartel will finally crumble and the forces of
competition will finally prevail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ITC recognizes that the proposed decree is the product of considerable negotiations between the Department and Pilkington
and that to press Pilkington further in hopes of achieving the additional relief described above may jeopardize the
deal. So be it. The Antitrust Division has rarely been exposed to a cartel with the reach, longevity and anti-competitive
consequences of the Pilkington cartel. The evidence of willfulness and of liability, as we both know, is unusually
rich and unambiguous. The world business community, upon whom the Antitrust Division quite properly devotes considerable
time and public resources in order to both demonstrate the commitment of the U.S. government to aggressive enforcement
of the U.S. antitrust laws and the important public benefits to be derived therefrom, has long been aware of Pilkington
and its success in creating and maintaining its worldwide cartel. Thus, should the Division lack the tenacity and
commitment to principle to insist that the decree be amended in order to meaningfully eradicate this particularly
pernicious, long-lived cartel, the message received by the many observers of the antitrust scene will be most unfortunate.
That message, however unfair from your perspective, is that the Antitrust Division lacks the will to litigate potentially
protracted cases, preferring instead to settle for the appearance of progress by accepting what has been characterized
as a ``sleeves off the vest'' type of decree. At some point, in some case, the Department must demonstrate that this
message is incorrect; that in the appropriate circumstances, the Division will litigate aggressively and fearlessly
in order to fully vindicate the public interest. ITC submits that the Pilkington case_should Pilkington be unwilling
to renegotiate the decree to satisfy the concerns expressed above_is the perfect vehicle for the Division to use for
this purpose and ITC urges it to do so.

Re: Response to Comments on Proposed Final judgment U.S. v. Pilkington plc and Pilkington Holdings, Inc. Civ 94&hyph;345

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dear Mr. Anderson: This responds to the Comments of International Technologies Consultants, Inc. Regarding Proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulations and Competitive Impact Statement (``Comments'') submitted to the Antitrust Division
over your signature on September 1, 1994. The Comments, in addition to making a Preliminary Statement that characterizes
the proposed Final Judgment (``Judgment'') and summarizes certain representations by Defendants to the press concerning
the effect that they expect it to have on their future conduct, proposes two specific changes to be made before the Judgment
is entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before addressing your specific proposals for change, we would point out that the text of the proposed Final Judgment
(``Judgment''), rather than Pilkington's characterization thereof in its own press releases controls what it will
be permitted and required to do. Thus, contrary to Pilkington's public claim, which you quote, that the restraints
Pilkington has imposed under the guise of ``protection and licensing of its total float technology, throughout the
rest of the world, remain unaffected,'' the Judgment will in fact enjoin Pilkington from anticompetitive practices
throughout the world
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the extent that those practices are aimed at U.S.-based entities seeking to use float technology anywhere, or are
aimed at anyone else seeking to use float technology in North America. That is, Pilkington's specified anticompetitive
conduct is enjoined insofar as it is within the jurisdiction of the U.S. antitrust laws. The competitive effect of
Pilkington's ability, also referred to in the portion of Pilkington's press release that you quote, to continue ``normal
licensing'' of its ``recent float bath technology,'' must be considered in the light of its ready concession to the
United States during settlement negotiations that very little significant technology of that kind exists. A good
measure of the near-absence of such significant recent technology is that float glass manufacture by those who have
not been licensed to use this ``recent technology'' has been quite competitive with Pilkington's and its subsidiaries'
production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard we have applied in assessing your specific proposals for modification or clarification is whether it
is in the public interest to enter that Judgment that has been submitted for entry by stipulation. Entry is in the public
interest if the Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your first proposed change is to add, at the end of Subparagraph IV.A., a provision enjoining Defendants from entering,
enforcing, or implementing any contract having the purpose or effect of preventing, interfering with, or otherwise
handicapping efforts by U.S. NON-LICENSEES
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to enter the float process technology market anywhere in the world. It is the Department's view that, although the
conduct proscribed by the proposed amendment would clearly be unlawful, this proposed amendment would be redundant
inasmuch as Subparagraph VI.B. adequately protects against such conduct by enjoining Defendants from employing
the means it heretofore relied upon to achieve its anticompetitive ends, i.e., making unjustified assertions of
intellectual property rights against putative entrants and their customers, financing sources, suppliers, and
the like.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, your Comments propose different conditions than those contained in Subparagraph IV.B.2. of the Judgment
to govern the circumstances under which Defendants can avoid violating that provision's injunction against asserting
certain know-how rights vis-a-vis U.S. NON-LICENSEES. The proposed amendment would require this Court, each time
such an assertion is made, to appoint a Special Master to determine whether Defendants have proven an adequate basis
for the assertion unless the matter is resolved by negotiation. (Your proposal would require ``Pilkington [to] pay
all costs should it not prevail'' in such a proceeding, but is silent as to who would pay the Special Master's costs if
Defendants do prevail.) Your proposal would thus delete from the Judgment provisions that require defendants to
justify in writing to the Department of Justice assertions of the kind that your proposal would submit to Special masters.
In the Department's view, requiring this Court to appoint a Special Master whenever such an assertion fails to be resolved
by negotiation would not assure, to a sufficiently greater extent than the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment,
that Defendants will henceforth desist from claiming know-how rights that are unjustified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above the Department of Justice does not believe that it would be in the public interest to forego
entry of the Judgment for failure to incorporate any of your proposed changes. We nevertheless greatly appreciate
your interest in this matter.

Capitalized terms used in these comments without definition will have the meanings accorded to them by the proposed

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In Article I.A. of the Competitive Impact Statement, the Department of Justice (``DOJ'') summarizes the seven (7)
categories of activity allegedly engaged in by the Defendants in violation of the antitrust laws and the three (3)
categories of relief sought by the Complaint to eliminate such activities. At Article III of the Competitive Impact
Statement, DOJ summarizes how the competition favorable elements of the Final Judgment will, in effect, stop the
seven (7) categories of activity and thereby ``*&blank;*&blank;* eliminate any residual anticompetitive effects
of the restrictive license agreements and other conduct challenged by the Complaint.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The competition favorable elements are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Element Number 1: *&blank;*&blank;* [T]he Final Judgment would eliminate all territorial and use limitations [Defendants]
imposed on [their] U.S. licensees and allow them to manufacture on their own or sublicense any third party to do so anywhere
in the world *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Element Number 2: The Final Judgment will create ``*&blank;*&blank;* a similar `safe harbor' for any other American
individual or firm who is not a Pilkington float glass licensee to use any float technology 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
in its position
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 without liability to [Defendants]. (Emphasis supplied).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Element Number 3: The Final ``*&blank;*&blank;* Judgment would enjoin certain conduct having the purpose or effect
of restricting exports of float glass to the United States *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Element Number 4: The Final ``*&blank;*&blank;* Judgment would enjoin the [D]efendants from making certain adverse
representations *&blank;*&blank;* and would require [certain disclosures]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOJ has wrongly concluded that the issuance of an order embodying these four (4) elements will achieve the goal of ``*&blank;*&blank;*
eliminat[ing] any residual anticompetitive effects of the restrictive license agreements and other conduct challenged
by the Complaint *&blank;*&blank;*.'' because its selection of the elements rests upon flawed premises, including
at least the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Pilkington License Agreements have terminated and no valuable rights other than ``know-how'' rights may be
obtained under them by assignees or sublicensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The ``safe harbor'' as to Pilkington know-how created for U.S. Non-Licensees offers sufficient protection for
prospective assignees and/or sublicensees of U.S. Licensees and their lenders to cause them to risk tens of millions
of dollars in the construction of float glass plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Defendants will take no retributive action after the ten (10) year term of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Pilkington float technology that is in the public domain (expired Patents and proprietary know-how), if known
to prospective competitors, is sufficient to enable prospective competitors to construct and/or operate competitive
float plants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See Article II.A.2. of the Competitive Impact Statement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 which states ``*&blank;*&blank;* Pilkington has no intellectual property rights of substantial value *&blank;*&blank;*.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenting Party is One of the New Entrants Sought by DOJ
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Our client (the ``Commenting Party'') is an entity formed under the laws of one of the States of the United States which
now owns a Float Glass plant at which it manufactures and sells Float Glass. Commenting Party is an assignee and/or
sublicensee of two License Agreements entered into between a subsidiary and/or predecessor of one of the Defendants
and one of AFG, Ford, Guardian, PPG or LOF (the ``named Licensees''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the License Agreements as to which the Commenting Party is an assignee and/or sublicensee, the ``Licensed Patents''
covered by such License Agreements are expansively defined to include all U.S. Patents issued during the ``Term''
of the relevant License Agreement, U.S. Patent applications filed during such Term and the U.S. Patents that may be
issue thereunder, Patents as to which the contracting Pilkington entity has the right to grant a license or sub-license
and continuations, divisions and reissues of such Patents. The Terms of License Agreements ``expire'' after 1985
but the license rights concerning the License Patents become ``paid up'' and remain vital. This vitality extends
for the life of each of the License Patents and reaches into the 21st century. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commenting Party regarded and still regards these acquired and/or sublicensed rights to be essential to its continued
operation of its Float Glass plant. It would not have expended the tens of millions of dollars it did for its Float Glass
plant in the absence of its rights under such License Agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In obtaining these valuable license rights by assignment and/or sublicensing, Commenting Party in effect stepped
into the shoes of its assignor/sublicensor and may have inherited certain other features of the License Agreements
that DOJ has described as characteristic of Defendents' allegedly unlawful activities. These features include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Purported limitations on assignment and/or sublicensing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Restrictive confidentiality provisions respecting allegedly confidential information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 know-how (confidentiality provisions do not apply to technology disclosed in Patents laws restrict competitive
uses).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Commenting Party believes that other prospective entrants into the Float Glass industry will conclude, as Commenting
Party did, that the construction and operation of a competitive Float Glass plant requires such entrant to become
an assignee and/or sublicensee of Patent and other rights under a License Agreement derived from the Defendants,
their predesessors or subsidiaries (the ``Pilkington Group''). When they do so they may become subject to restrictive
provisions like those described above. The Final Judgment appears to permit the enforcement of these allegedly anti-competitive
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a prospective entrant into the Float Glass industry requires institutional financing in order to construct a Float
Glass plant having a cost, according to DOJ, of between $100 and $150 million dollars, will the protections allegedly
afforded by the Final Judgment resolve the issues that institutional lenders, institutional lawyers and borrower's
counsel will find in the License Agreements as modified by the Final Judgment? The answer simply stated is
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 no
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenting Party believes the flawed assumptions have led to a flawed result. This conclusion is illuminated by the
application of the elements of the Final Judgment to the facts of Commenting Party's case.

What Is Commenting Party's Assignor's/Sublicensor's Status?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Does the Final Judgment classify the Named Licensee with whom Commenty Party contracted (``Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor'')
as a ``U.S. Licensee''? To be a U.S. Licensee, one must first be a person, company or entity who is a ``Licensee.'' A person,
company or entity is not a Licensee unless they have ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* entered into a License Agreement with Pilkington.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Emphasis added'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* entered into *&blank;*&blank;* with Pilkington *&blank;*&blank;*'' appears
to require privity of contract. This privity is restricted, apparently, to persons, companies or entities in privity
with ``Pilkington.'' Since ``Pilkington'' is only Pilkington plc, this privity must be with the Defendant Pilkington
plc.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Pilkington plc is not the name of the member of the Pilkington Group with whom Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor
contracted in the License Agreements. Therefore, it is possible that Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor
is neither a ``Licensee'' nor a ``U.S. Licensee'' because its contractual privity is with a subsidiary or predecessor
of ``Pilkington'' instead of with Pilkington plc.

Even if a reader is to assume that the definitional flaw noted above does not exist, Commenting Party's and any other
future assignee's/sublicensee's status apparently will not change because none of them will have privity of contract
with ``Pilkington'' no matter how ``Pilkington'' is defined. Therefore, unless the Final Judgment is changed, Commenting
Party and all future assignees/sublicensees will only be ``U.S. Non-licensees.''

Why Are U.S. Non-licensees Who Enter Into Assignments/Sublicenses Under Pilkington License Agreements Not Expressly
Protected Against The Enforcement of Limitations?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It appears that DOJ believes that the prohibitions involving the enforcement of ``Limitations'' will result in the
assignment/sublicensing of ``Float Technology'' required to construct and operate competitive Float Glass plants.
These prohibitions, however, apply only to the allegedly anti-competitive activities of the defendants against
U.S. Licensees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Final Judgment Article IV.A. The protections relevant to U.S. Non-licensees are set out in Article IV.B. of the Final
Judgment. Article IV.B. does not prohibit the Defendants asserting Limitations against U.S. Non-licensees! Thus,
if Article IV.A. permits U.S. Licensees to assign/sublicense Float Technology, nowhere does Article IV.B. enable
the prospective assignees/sublicensees who may become new owners/operators of Float Glass plants to exercise free
from suit the rights they might hope to acquire in an assignment/sublicense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article IV.B.1 appears to apply only to a subclass of U.S. Non-licensees 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 employees, contractors, suppliers, consultants, etc., who, as a group, have entirely different interests than
prospective owner/operators of Float Glass plants. In substance Article IV.B.1. addresses only provisions of Agreements
respecting Confidentiality or non-competition. Since only the protections of Article IV.B.2. appear to apply to
assignees/sublicensees, the only subjects that the Defendants can't make claims about against such U.S. Non-licensees
relate to proprietary Float Technology know-how rights that Pilkington 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
has in fact disclosed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to someone who in fact fits the definition of U.S. Licensee, and which are not bona-fide trade secrets under ``applicable
law'' (as to which Pilkington may still enforce its rights under Article IV.B.2.). The protected class of intellectual
property is far less than the body of intellectual property encompassed by the License Agreements under which Commenting
Party and others similarly situated would want to derive rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Final Judgment is to be read these ways, the Defendants will be able to claim against assignees/sublicensees
that their assignment/sublicense agreements and/or practice of Patents covered by such assigned/sublicensed
Pilkington License Agreements are, among other things: wholly invalid, were obtained in breach of Pilkington's
Patent rights. (Article IV.H. of the Final Judgment expressly preserves all of Pilkington's Patent claims).

Why Do the Protections Intended By The Concept of Limitations Not Expressly And Literally Include Assignments and
Sublicenses?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, DOJ appears to believe that the elements of the final judgment will lead to assignment/sublicense
agreements concerning Float Technology. Surprisingly, the Final Judgment does not literally say anything of the
kind. We could not find any reference to assignments or sublicenses. As DOJ has noted, the License Agreements with
members of the Pilkington Group contain express, literal prohibitions respecting assignment and sublicensing.
The Defendants have reserved their rights respecting matters not ``expressly'' covered by the Final Judgment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article IV.I. of the Final Judgment. Institutional lenders or investors who may be asked to lend to or invest in prospective
Float Glass industry entrants can be expected to look for express, literal language in the Final Judgment to counter
the express, literal provisions of the License Agreements. Finding them absent, they will refuse to lend or invest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Limitations'' is defined by Article II.K. of the Final Judgment without any use of the words ``assignment'' or ``sublicensing.''
The word ``use'' appears in the definition but as Commenting Party has shown above, the word ``Limitations'' is used
only in Article IV.A. with respect to U.S. Licensees and not their contracting parties, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 their prospective assignees/sublicensees are U.S. Non-licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article IV.A.1. of the Final Judgment uses the word ``sublicensing'' but appears to do so only in connection with ``Subject
Float Technology.'' As defined, ``Subject Float Technology'' appears to encompass only ``know-how'' (see above
discussion). Therefore, Float Technology that is Patent technology or that was subject to disclosure by Pilkington
but not in fact disclosed is not encompassed by Article IV.A.1. of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenting Party notes, in passing, that Article IV.A.3.(b) curiously refers to ``transferring'' and ``transferees''
of Float Technology without thereby telling the reader what such words encompass or connecting them to other Articles
of the Final Judgment. This creates further ambiguity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assignments/sublicenses and the role DOJ expects them to play are too important for the Final Judgment to treat them
ambiguously or even silently. As noted above, the Defendants seem to retain important rights to sue. These rights
appear to be strongest on subject relating to Patents and provisions of the Final Judgment that are not ``express''
enough. Commenting Party believes that without changes to the Final Judgment no prospective assignee/sublicensee
can be given any clear assurances that the Final Judgment prohibits the Defendants from suing them for attempting
to enter the Float Glass industry. Why would anyone risk investing in or lending to an entity which cannot receive or
provide assurances that its ostensible assignment/sublicense under a Licensee Agreement with a member of the Pilkington
Group protects it from suits by the Defendants?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, even if ``Limitations'' is changed to literally permit assignments/sublicenses, under Article
IV.A. its protections extend only to U.S. Licensees. As Commenting Party has shown above, the protections afforded
to U.S. Non-licensees appear in Article IV.B. of the Final Judgment. Again, the needed words of art ``assignment''
or ``sublicense'' do not appear there.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, DOJ may intend that the Final Judgment will be interpreted to permit assignment/sublicensing of Float Technology
that is either or both licensed Patent technology or know-how technology, but, under the express, literal terms of
the Final Judgment, the assignee/licensee clearly has protection only with respect to non-Patented know-how that
was in fact disclosed by Pilkington plc to a person, company or entity that is a U.S. Licensee. In Commenting Party's
case, it appears the Final Judgment is too narrow in application to encompass Commenting Party's rights under its
assignment and/or sublicense agreement. If Commenting Party were to consider further assigning/sublicensing
its rights under the relevant Agreements, Commenting Party could not assure any prospective sub-assignee/sub-sublicensee
that the Final Judgment affords them any protection against the restrictions contained in such Agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the ambiguous phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* other than Float Technology *&blank;*&blank;*'' in the definition
of ``Subject Float Technology'' threatens the entire concept. Is it intended that if the Pilkington 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Group disclosed Flat Technology to LOF, then such Float Technology is not ``Subject Float Technology'' even though
such Float Technology was also disclosed to AFG, PPG or Ford? This shouldn't be the case. Presumably, the intent was
to exclude 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Float Technology that was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 disclosed to a U.S. Licensee who was also a Pilkington plc subsidiary at the time of disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenting Party does not believe that DOJ intended any of these unfavorable interpretations. If DOJ wants there
to be assignees and/or sublicensees of License Agreements deriving from Agreements between any of the named Licensees
and any member of the Pilkington Group, then the prohibitions respecting ``Limitations'' must be extended to this
class of persons, companies and entities. The defects noted in this analysis can be eliminated by modest changes to
the definitions of ``Pilkington'', ``U.S. Licensee'', ``U.S. Non-licensee'', ``Limitations'' and ``Subject
Float technology.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Why Will English Law Be Permitted To Govern All Important Questions of Law?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons, companies and entities who become assignees/sublicensees under License Agreements with a member of the
Pilkington Group may become subject to the choice of law provisions contained in the original License Agreements.
While DOJ has challenged the Pilkington Group's contracting practices, the Final Judgment does nothing to change
a central feature of the License Agreements. Even more ominously, the Final Judgment introduces vagueness and ambiguity
concerning these features leaving the Defendants free to argue entirely different meanings in venues outside the
jurisdiction of the District Court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the proposed Final Judgement, particularly in reference to the issue of Confidential Information, the
phrase ``applicable'' law appears. Under the License Agreements available to Commenting Party, the Pilkington
Group chose the laws of England to govern the interpretation and application of such License Agreements. It is highly
likely that this choice of law appears in all relevant License Agreements and will through the assignment/sublicensing
process sought by DOJ run through any future relevant Agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the words ``applicable law'' appears in the phrase'' *&blank;*&blank;* trade secret under applicable
law *&blank;*&blank;*.'' What does this mean? The learned treatise 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Legal Protection of Trade Secrets
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (the ``English Treatise''), at Section 2.2.5 says ``The term trade secret is not really a term of art in English law
in contrast with its usage in American law *&blank;*&blank;*. Thus, the effect of the Final Judgment appears to be
that the laws of England will apply to the interpretation of the concept of ``trade secret'' and such English law does
not use such words as a ``term of art.'' Does this mean that Defendants' lawyers will be free to fill in for English arbitrators
(the Final Judgment makes no attempt to eliminate the London venue and English arbitrators that have apparently been
used with such anti-competitive effect in litigation with licensees) what the term means?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The English Treatise offers two (2) formulations of the concept of ``confidential information.'' Which of the two
rules will apply? Which of them, if either, furthers the purposes of the Final Judgment? Why will the Defendants be
left with the power to argue their interpretation of what ``trade secret under applicable law'' means to arbitrators
sited in London? Why should the District Court be confident that the purposes of the Final Judgment will be given effect
by English arbitrators interpreting the vague and ambiguous language of an order of, to them, a foreign court?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue also is raised in another context by Final Judgment Article IV.B.1. which refers to restrictions on competition
under ``applicable law.'' If English law governs this issue too, how will the District Court be assured that such law
is consistent with the purposes of the Final Judgment?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, these vague and ambiguous formulations favor the Defendants and the perpetuation of the contractual regime
challenged by DOJ. The Final Judgment obscures this issue by not disclosing that English laws governs every Agreement
that is important in the future assignment/sublicensing activity sought by DOJ. Nothing in the Final Judgment purpose
to guide (much less control) the arbitrators in their interpretation of the License Agreements and assignments/sublicenses
under them in light of the Final Judgement.

6. The Final Judgment should expressly reserve jurisdiction to the District Court to decide what laws are applicable
in any future litigation involving the Defendants and any person, company or entity that is an assignee/sublicensee
under any Agreement derived from a License Agreement with a member of the Pilkington Group. The Final Judgment could
permit interlocutory appeals to the District Court of any questions of interpretation and expressly subject the
arbitrators to the District Court's jurisdiction. The Final Judgment could permit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 judicial review by the District Court of any decisions of arbitrators respecting any such assignees/sublicensees.

7. The Final Judgment could also replace the arbitration venue provisions of the License Agreements with the venue
of the District Court. This would ensure that any arbitrators are subject to the District Court's jurisdiction. The
Defendants are already subject to the District Court's jurisdiction and venue and there is no hint in the Stipulation
that the venue is inconvenient to the members of the Pilkington Group.

Why Is Retributive Conduct Not Prohibited After Expiration of the Final Judgment?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Article VII.A. of the Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment will expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry.
What happens then to persons, companies or entities who have invested millions of dollars in obtaining the purported
benefits of the Final Judgment by assignment and/or sublicensing under License Agreements? There will then be no
prohibition against the Defendants enforcing their contract and other rights. Upon such expiration, can the Defendants
enforce all of their suspended rights to the extent that they haven't lapsed by application of any applicable statute
of limitations? What is the applicable statute? Does the phrase ``applicable law'' mean that this issue is governed
by the laws of England. If English law governs, The Limitation Act of 1980 provides for a six (6) year statute of limitations
for breach of contract claims. Will this not mean that assignments and/or grants of sublicenses by U.S. Licensees
in year five (5) after the entry of the Final Judgement are subject to suit in year eleven (11)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Is the applicable statute of limitations tolled during the effectiveness of the Final Judgment? Is it the intention
of the Final Judgment to bar certain claims, not to suspend them? The Final Judgment should make this clear, whether
by providing that the Defendants shall not assert that the Final Judgment has tolled any statute of limitations, or
otherwise. Alternatively, the Final Judgment could simply be made permanent with respect to all facts and circumstances
arising during the ten (10) year period the Final Judgment is effective.

9. What is the basis for the conclusion set our in press statements by DOJ that the Float Technology embodied in Patents
expiring in 1982 and before and other technology in the public domain is sufficient to enable a prospective entrant
to construct and operate a competitive Float Glass plant? There appear to be hundreds of Pilkington Group Patents
in the United States and hundreds of others in foreign countries. Has DOJ in consultation with anyone in the Float Glass
industry or who is a prospective entrant, determined that none of these Patents describes Float Technology needed
for a competitive Float Glass plant?

Notwithstanding the Final Judgment and in the absence of an assignment or sublicense of rights under a License Agreement
with a member of the Pilkington Group, a prospective entrant into the Float Glass industry will have to engage Patent
lawyer(s) to understand each of the unexpired Patents and determine what Float Technology cannot be practiced. The
review of hundreds of unexpired Patents promises significant costs to parties who cannot obtain rights by assignment
or sublicensing.

Commenting Party believes that changes must be made in the Final Judgment if DOJ's goal is to be achieved. Commenting
Party believes that without modification of the Final Judgment no prospective entrant will be able to provide the
assurances that commercial lenders and institutional investors require on the serious issues raised by the express,
literal provisions of the Pilkington License Agreements.

Dear Mr. Grimstad: This letter responds to your letter of August 10, 1994, commenting on and proposing changes in the
proposed Final Judgment (``Judgment'') in the above-captioned matter. You complained that (i) the Judgment rests
on several ``flawed assumptions'' listed in your letter that you said ``have led to a flawed result''; (ii) contrary
to the Department of Justice's conclusion, the relief the Judgment provides does not eliminate the residual anticompetitive
effects of the challenged agreements or behavior; and (iii) the Judgment is ``too narrow in application to encompass
[the] rights'' of a domestic glass manufacturer you represent but declined to identify. In trying to support those
complaints, you applied the precise provisions of the proposed Judgment to your anonymous client's vaguely and ambiguously
described licensing arrangements, and then concluded there are gaps in the Judgment's coverage that do not in fact
exist. We have addressed separately below each of the changes you recommended to the proposed Judgment. For the reason
indicated, we believe there is no basis for modifying the Judgment. The standard applied in assessing your specific
proposals is whether it is in the public interest to enter the Judgment submitted by stipulation. Entry is in the public
interest if the Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. You proposed expanding the definition ``Pilkington'' to include the two named defendants' ``past, present and
future predecessors, affiliates and subsidiaries,'' so that the ``named licensees (AFG, Ford, Guardian, PPG, and
LOF) ``are in fact encompassed by the definition of `Licensee'.'' This change is necessary, you said, because your
client is ``an assignee and/or sublicensee of two license agreements *&blank;*&blank;* between [i] a subsidiary
and/or predecessor of one of the defendants'' and (ii) one of the ``named licensees,'' and because the Judgment's
definition of Licensee requires contractual privity with Pilkington itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe the change is unnecessary to achieve your stated objective since each of the ``named licensees'' already
is clearly a Licensee as defined in the proposed Judgment. All five of those companies entered into float licensee
agreements with defendant Pilkington, not with a predecessor, affiliate, or subsidiary of Pilkington. Since execution
of those agreements, only Pilkington's corporate name has been changed from ``Pilkington Brothers Limited'' to
``Pilkington plc.'' Thus, Pilkington plc is the same corporate entity as, not a successor of, Pilkington Brothers
Limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. You also proposed expanding the definition of ``Licensee'' to include not only anyone who has entered into a license
agreement with Pilkington, but also anyone who is ``an assignee and/or sublicensee'' under a license agreement with
either Pilkington or any of the ``named licensees.'' That is necessary, you said, so that anyone ``who derive[s] rights
from any chain of agreements that extend ultimately to a license agreement with [Pilkington]'' will get the benefits
of such a license agreement with Pilkington as ``prospective assignees/sublicensees of U.S. Licensees'' under
the proposed Judgment. But this change, too, is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed Judgment, subject to a narrow exception and certain conditions relating to
maintaining the confidentiality of legitimate trade secrets, expressly permits any U.S. Licensee (including each
of the five ``named licensees'') to sublicense anywhere in the world (including the U.S.) the float glass technology
Pilkington disclosed and licensed to it, free of any license restrictions or limitations and without payment of any
royalties, lump sum, or line fees for such sublicensing. Clearly then, for that provision of Subparagraph IV.A.1.
to have any meaningful effect, anyone acquiring rights to use such technology under such a sublicense must be as free
to use it anywhere without restriction or limitation by Pilkington or payment of royalties or fees to Pilkington,
subject to the same conditions concerning confidentiality, as the U.S. Licensee from whom such rights were obtained.
The same would be true too for any further sublicensing by such a sublicensee. Anything less than that, if the result
of any action taken by Pilkington, would be a clear violation of the proposed Judgment, with which Pilkington is required
by stipulation to comply pending its approval by the court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It seems clear to us that the result would be the same, insofar as Pilkington is concerned, whether such a sublicense
agreement were executed before or after entry of the proposed Judgment. As for assignments, the result should be the
same, assuming, as a matter of law, the assignee effectively stands in the shoes of or is substituted for the assignor,
and the rights involved are assignable. However, the proposed Judgment does not purport to address specifically
the consequences of such assignments since they were not the principal focus of the challenged agreements or conduct
involved here. Moreover, we cannot be any more definitive on their implications for your client because you have not
provided enough information about its current licensing arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. You proposed changing the definition of ``Non-Licensee'' from anyone who has not entered into a license agreement
with Pilkington to anyone who is not a Licensee, because, you said, the current definition ``contains the overly restrictive
concept of privity of contract *&blank;*&blank;*.'' But since anyone who is not in contractual privity with Pilkington
is not a Licensee, your proposal is the equivalent of the current definition. Moreover, since a Licensee is anyone
who is in contractual privity with Pilkington, the proposed Judgment's definitions of ``Licensee'' and ``Non-Licensee''
together cover the entire universe of persons entitled to the benefits of the Judgment, without any gap between them.
For purposes of the proposed Judgment, your client is either a ``Licensee'' or a ``Non-Licensee,'' whatever else
it may be (assignee, sublicensee, etc.) by reason of its current licensing arrangements. Thus, no need for the proposed
change has been shown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The change proposed in the definition of ``Limitations'' is to include references to sublicensing and assignment
so as to permit those activities. But including such references in the definition of ``Limitations'' does not provided
the authorization you seek and confuses the concept of ``Limitations,'' which are restrictions on the exercise (e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 in certain territories or for certain uses) of rights already granted. Whether the separate right of sublicense or
to make assignments also is authorized is, as noted above, already controlled by Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed
Judgment in the case of sublicensing and by operation of law for assignments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
You also complained that ``the needed words of art `assignment' or `sublicense' do not appear'' in Subparagraph IV.B.,
which provides certain injunctive relief for U.S. Non-Licensees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 those who have not entered into float glass license agreements with Pilkington). As you correctly observed, however,
Subparagraph IV.B. does not enjoin Pilkington from enforcing limitations against them. But there is no need to do
so; since U.S. Non-Licensees by definition are not in privity of contract with Pilkington, there is no contractual
or other legitimate basis for Pilkington to enforce any license-agreement limitations against them. For the same
reason, it is not necessary that Subparagraph IV.B. enjoin Pilkington from restricting or prohibiting the exercise
of the right to sublicense or make assignments against persons with whom it is not in contractual privity under any
float license agreement. Thus, neither the word ``assignment'' nor the word ``sublicensee'' is ``needed as part
of the definition or concept of ``Limitations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. You proposed to expand the definition of ``Subject Float Technology'' to include patented as well as unpatented
float technology and to include float technology that was ``subject to disclosure'' as well as that actually disclosed
to any given Licensee. In support, you claimed, incorrectly, that ``the protected class of intellectual property
is far less than the body of intellectual property encompassed by the License Agreements *&blank;*&blank;*'' (p.
6, your letter). Indeed, they are the same.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose and effect of Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed Judgment is to free U.S. Licensees from any restraints
(other than confidentiality) concerning all intellectual property rights acquired from Pilkington, to the extent
that has not already occurred. As noted in the Competitive Impact Statement (p. 9), all U.S. Licensees' float license
agreements have terminated, and the royalty obligations thereunder have become fully paid up. Also, Pilkington
has acknowledged that its basic patent protection relating to the original form of float process has largely expired,
and has represented that all mutual exchanges between Pilkington and its U.S. licensees (whether patented or not)
have been terminated, the latest ten years ago. Pilkington has represented further (as have some of its U.S. Licensees)
that all of the U.S. float glass patents licensed by Pilkington to any U.S. Licensee, either under the original grant
or the improvement exchange provisions of the licenses, have expired. It is simply unnecessary, therefore, to cover
patented rights that essentially no longer exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for technology that was ``subject to disclosure,'' that language is so vague and indefinite it would be impossible
to identify the technology involved. In any case, it seems wholly unnecessary. According to the relevant float glass
license agreements, Pilkington was obliged to disclose to each licensee (i) all ``necessary or useful'' know-how
Pilkington developed, owned, or controlled at the time and (ii) all patented and unpatented float process improvements
Pilkington discovered, owned, or controlled during the term of the mutual exchange provisions. Together, those
obligations likely covered whatever might have been ``subject to disclosure.'' Of course, the proposed Judgment
does not apply to any technology disclosed by a U.S. Licensee to your client (or to anyone else) that belongs to that
U.S. Licensee rather than to Pilkington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as you correctly observed (p. 8, your letter), the exclusionary language of the definition of ``Subject
Float Technology''_other than float technology disclosed by Pilkington to any U.S. Licensee while Pilkington owned
50% or more of that U.S. Licensee_excludes float technology disclosed to a U.S. Licensee who was a Pilkington subsidiary
at the time of disclosure (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 LOF) and not also disclosed to any other licensee who was not then a subsidiary (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 AFG, PPG, or Ford). We believe that intent is clear from the plain meaning of the exclusion (especially considering
the included language, ``in relation to any given licensee,'' which limits the excluded technology), and so it is
unnecessary to add the word ``only'' to the definition as you propose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6/7. You objected to (i) language in the proposed Final Judgment for resolving trade secret issues under ``applicable
law,'' and (ii) the arbitration provisions of Pilkington's float license agreements plus the application of English
law to disputes involving those agreements; accordingly, you proposed that the Judgment expressly reserve to the
District Court jurisdiction over questions of applicable law in future litigation involving the defendants (including
provisions for interlocutory appeals) and over any designated arbitrators (including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 review of their decisions). Alternatively, you also proposed replacing the choice of law provisions of the licenses
with, for example, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and replacing the arbitration provisions with the venue of the District
Court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your proposal seems far too sweeping insofar as it would reach future litigation. Moreover, the proposed Judgment
(Subparagraph VII.B) already provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action and the parties. In addition,
any court can, as this Court did in a related case in which it referred antitrust claims to arbitration, retain jurisdiction
over arbitration proceedings for purposes of reviewing the decisions in those proceedings. Finally, the language
(``under applicable law'') in the Judgment to which you objected requires application of the relevant conflict of
laws rule, as to both U.S. Licensees and U.S. Non-Licensees, in determining the nature and existence of trade secrets,
rather than, in the case of U.S. Licensees, merely following the license provision that requires application of English
law. In any case, contrary to the implication of your letter based on the treatise cited therein (p. 10), we believe
there is little, if any, substantive difference between the trade secret law of the United States and the comparable
body of English law. Thus, we are unpersuaded that either of the alternative changes you propose should be adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. You proposed changing Subparagraph VII.A., which sets the term of the Judgment, in ways that effectively extend
its duration beyond 10 years. In concluding that a period of 10 years is the appropriate life for most consent judgments,
the Department has recognized that the anticompetitive effects of any challenged conduct or practices usually are
fully dissipated within that time and that, because of the market changes likely to occur within that period, the operation
of the judgment itself can have an undesirable competitive impact after 10 years. In this case, the Department believes
that Pilkington technology is to a very substantial extent publicly known and therefore no longer of sufficient value
to justify any restraints on its use, including obligations to maintain its confidentiality. Even more so would that
be the case 10 years from now. Clearly, Pilkington would be subject to renewed antitrust challenge in the event it reinstituted,
after expiration of the Judgment, the practices and conduct that led to this case in the first place. Thus, we believe
Subparagraph VII.A. should remain unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. You complained that a prospective entrant into the float glass industry who cannot obtain rights by assignment
or sublicensing would incur significant costs to the extent it was necessary (i) to review what you said are hundreds
of unexpired relevant Pilkington float glass patents not licensed to U.S. Licensees, and (ii) to determine what float
glass technology in the public domain is sufficient to construct and operate a competitive float glass plant. By failing
to propose a specific change to address this complaint, you implicitly acknowledged that there are none that would
avoid this task entirely or eliminate all risks associated with entry. Of course, without any modification, the proposed
Judgment will allow U.S. Licensees to sublicense the requisite technology they used to construct and operate competitive
float glass plants in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, we do not believe it would be in the public interest to forego entry of the proposed Judgment for failure to include
therein any of your proposed changes. Nevertheless, we appreciate your interest in this matter and in the enforcement
of the antitrust laws.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Modification of Final Judgment</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that defendant United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. (``UATC'') has filed with the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin a motion to modify the Final Judgment in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States v. Capitol Service, Inc. et al.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No. 80&hyph;C&hyph;407, and the Department of Justice (``Department''), in a stipulation also filed with the Court,
has consented to modification of the Final Judgment, but has reserved the right to withdraw its consent based on public
comments or for other reasons. The Complaint in this case (filed on May 5, 1980) alleged that UATC and three other Milwaukee
motion picture exhibitors had since 1977 engaged in a combination and conspiracy to restrain trade by ``splitting'',
or allocating among themselves, the rights to negotiate for films released by motion picture distribution companies,
in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Final Judgment (entered on June 17, 1983) enjoins the defendants ``from further engaging in any motion picture
split agreements, in any form and with any person, in any motion picture exhibition market throughout the United States.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has filed with the Court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why it believes that modification of
the Final Judgment to permit a singular exemption from the Court's injunction for a UATC theatre in San Jose, California
to be constructed under the auspices of the City's Redevelopment Agency, would be in the public interest. Copies of
the Complaint, the Final Judgment, the defendant's motion papers, the Stipulation containing the Government's
tentative consent, the Department's memorandum, and all further papers filed with the Court in connection with this
motion will be available for inspection at Room 3235, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 10th Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (Telephone: (202) 514&hyph;2481), and at the Office of the Clerk
of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Copies of any
of these materials may be obtained from the Antitrust Division upon request and payment of the copying fee set by Department
regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may submit comments to the Department regarding the proposed modification of the Final Judgment.
Such comments must be received within the sixty-day period established by court order, and will be filed with the Court
by the Department. Comments should be addressed to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section,
Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 555 Fourth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 (telephone: (202) 307&hyph;5799).

Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.380(d)(4)
(escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Dilworth Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;04281) located in Greene County,
Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to establish two separate and distinct primary intake escapeways during
development of three-entry longwall gate sections; to have the total length of unattended supply cars maintained
on the end of the supply track at 150 feet and other rail vehicles readily mobile on the longwall development section;
to have a clearance of 42 inches on the wide side of the cars when an unattended trip of supply cars is parked on the supply
track/intake escapeway of the three-entry development section; to periodically test the wide side clearances along
the supply cars to assure that a stretcher can move through the area; and to post a reflective sign that indicates limited
clearance at both the inby and outby ends of the supply cars and at the entrance of the mine. The petitioner proposes
to establish two separate and distinct secondary escapeways on retreat that would be identified with signs and markers
in the belt entry from the longwall face to the track entry at a distance not to exceed 1000 feet, and the minimum width
of the travelway in the belt entry at two feet and maintained clear and free of obstruction; to periodically test the
wide side clearances along that portion of the belt entry designated as an alternate escapeway to assure that a minimum
clearance of two feet is maintained; to instruct personnel working in the area to use the primary escapeway in an emergency;
to deenergize the longwall machinery and belt line when transporting persons if the primary escapeway is impassable;
and to train all personnel assigned to work in the area prior to implementation of the proposed alternate method and
during annual refresher training. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at
least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Ram Head Coal Company, 277 Main Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.360 (preshift examination) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08454) located in Schuylkill County,
Pennsylvania. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the preshift examination
after an air quantity reading is taken in by the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake
air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Ram Head Coal Company, 277 Main Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1), (4), and (5) (weekly examination) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08454) located
in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions and roof falls, certain areas of the intake air course
cannot be safely traveled. The petitioner proposes to examine the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway from
the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and
thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.2, regarding annual exercise of the emergency plan to Georgia Power Company
(GPC or the licensee), for the Vogtle Electric Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Dalton, Georgia.

Identification of the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption would allow a one-time schedular exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
E, Section IV.F.2 which states that each licensee at each site shall annually exercise its emergency plan. By letter
dated July 21, 1994, the licensee requested a schedular exemption from the requirement for the Vogtle Power Station,
based upon a request from the State of Georgia and local governments, to delay the exercise from July 27, 1994, to January
11, 1995, because of the flood disaster in Georgia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee had planned to conduct a full-participation exercise involving the States of Georgia and South Carolina
and local response organizations on July 27, 1994. The licensee requested that an exemption be granted because the
State of Georgia requested to delay the 1994 annual exercise from July 27, 1994, to January 11, 1995. The request to
move the exercise date was originated by the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) because they would be unable
to participate on July 27 as GEMA personnel were required to respond to a federally-declared flood disaster in South
Georgia. This proposed delay will prevent Vogtle from meeting the annual requirement to exercise the Vogtle emergency
plan as specified in Appendix E to 10 CFR 50, and therefore, GPC requested a schedular exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The previous emergency preparedness exercise at Vogtle was successfully conducted on August 4, 1993, and no violations,
deviations or exercise weaknesses were identified. Offsite participation was limited to receiving Emergency Notification
messages. A joint plume and ingestion exposure pathway exercise involving the States of Georgia and South Carolina
and the four local governmental agencies was conducted on May 19, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee had scheduled, planned and coordinated the 1994 exercise with participating Federal, State, and local
agencies for mid-July. The scope and objectives, and the final scenario documentation for the July 1994 exercise
were submitted to the NRC on April 14, 1994, and May 17, 1994, respectively, which is within the time frames established
for their submittal in support of a July 1994 exercise.

The schedule for future exercise will not be affected by this exemption. GPC has stated it will conduct the previously
scheduled 1995 exercise the week of July 19, 1995, as planned. The licensee states that concurrence for the proposed
date of January 11, 1995, has been received from FEMA, NRC Region II, and the affected State and local agencies. FEMA
confirmed its support for the revised exercise date on September 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon a review of the licensee's request for an exemption from the requirement to conduct an exercise of the Vogtle
emergency plan in 1994, the NRC staff finds that the underlying purpose of the regulation will not be adversely affected
by the rescheduling of the July 27, 1994, exercise to January 11, 1995. The effective response capability demonstrated
by the licensee during the 1993 emergency preparedness exercise, the activities in preparation for the 1994 exercise,
including a table top exercise with the States and counties and the readiness of the licensee's emergency preparedness
program as reflected in its SALP rating and the most recent inspection report, provide assurance that the resources
and personnel necessary for proper emergency response are in place to respond to a nuclear emergency at the Vogtle
site. Thus, an exercise in 1994 is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule, and the requested exemption
from the requirement in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F, to defer the performance of an exercise of the Vogtle
emergency plan until January 11, 1995, will not adversely affect the overall state of emergency preparedness at the
Vogtle site.

The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption is needed because the Georgia Emergency management Agency (GEMA) was required to respond
to a federally-declared flood disaster in South Georgia at the time of the scheduled annual emergency exercise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV. F.2, indicates that the granting
of the proposed exemption will not involve any measurable environmental impacts since the exemption deals with the
exercise of the licensee's emergency plan. Plant configuration and operations are not changed. Therefore, the Commission
concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with
the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result
in diversion of plant resources from addressing important health and safety issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This exemption from the scheduled exercise on July 27, 1994, does not reduce the use of resources since the schedule
for future exercises will not be affected by this exemption. The licensee has stated it will conduct the previously
scheduled 1995 exercise the week of July 19, 1995, as planned. Thus, the requested exemption would provide only temporary
relief from the requirement to conduct an annual exercise.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the Georgia State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff published in January 1994 a draft BTP on Performance Assessment for LLW Disposal Facilities and copies
were distributed for review by Agreement States. The BTP was based on the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10,
Chapter 1, Part 61 ``Licensing Requirement for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste,'' (Part 61) that specifies license
requirements and performance objectives for LLW disposal facilities. The guidance objective of the BTP is to provide
license applicants, licensees, States and compacts, and the NRC staff with an acceptable strategy and methodology
for performing the technical analysis required to demonstrate compliance, in the post-closure time frame, with
the performance objective in Part 61, governing radiological protection of the public health and safety and the environment.
Participants in this workshop will discuss regulatory and technical issues in the draft BTP and the development of
NRC's test case simulations Also, State regulatory and technical issues will be discussed. To achieve a more successful
workshop, participants are encouraged to read the BTP before attending the workshop. Copies can be obtained from
Dr. Salomon.

Florida Power Corporation (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;72, which authorizes
operation of the Crystal River Nuclear Generating Plant Unit 3. The license provides, among other things, that the
licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 50 (10 CFR Part 50), Appendix A, ``General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power
Plants,'' Criterion 3, ``Fire protection,'' specifies that ``Structures, systems, and components important to
safety shall be designed and located to minimize, consistent with other safety requirements, the probability and
effect of fires and explosions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, sets forth fire protection features required to satisfy general design Criterion 3 of the
Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, ``Oil collection system for reactor
coolant pump,'' the reactor coolant pump (RCP) shall be equipped with an oil collection system which ``*&blank;*&blank;*
shall be capable of collecting lube oil from all potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the reactor
coolant pump lube oil systems.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee proposed to replace the existing RCP motors with a new motor and implement a re-designed RCP lube oil system.
As a result of physical interferences and other design difficulties, four specific sites in the RCP motor lube oil
system could not accommodate an oil collection systems for collecting potential oil leakage. The four potential
leakage sites are: the anti-reverse device (ARD) vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower
motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exemption from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, is required to permit the four specific sites in the RCP
lube oil systems not to be equipped with an oil collection system, and thus, exclude them from leakage protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated June 7, 1993, as supplemented March 28, 1994, the licensee submitted its exemption request for this
purpose.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, is to establish an oil collection system such that lube
oil leakage from potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the RCP lube oil systems will not lead to
fire during normal or design basis accident conditions and that there is reasonable assurance that the system will
withstand the Safe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The licensee's proposed RCP motor lube oil system could not accommodate an oil collection system for collecting potential
oil leakage from four specific sites. The staff evaluation of these sites is as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The RCP motor lube oil system, with its pumps and associated piping, supply oil to several parts of the RCP. The existing
RCP lube oil system includes a high pressure and an induced flow system. The high pressure system consists of two independent
pumps, and associated piping, and supplies oil, among other components, to the ARD. The induced flow system is driven
by the rotation of the RCP motor and provides lube oil to the thrust bearings, guide bearings, and to the ARD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In the new design, the ARD vents located at the top of each RCP motor would be equipped with demisters. According to the
equipment vendor, the ARD vent lines only contain oil mist or foam during startup, shutdown, and normal operation.
The demisters are equipped with a filter to prevent lube oil mist from escaping to the atmosphere. Two upper lube oil
supply lines provide oil to the ARD from the low pressure lube oil system lift pump during startup and shutdown of the
RCP motor. During normal operation, oil is provided to the ARD by the induced flow system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The ARD vents are not part of a pressurized system. Therefore, spray shield protection for mechanical connections
is not provided. If leakage were to occur during normal plant operations from the ARD demisters or from the mechanical
connections, the oil would run down the side of the torque drum and bearing housing, be collected by a one-inch lip on
the bottom of the upper RCP motor bearing housing, and then be channeled to the oil collection drain pan for the upper
lube oil cooler. The two upper lube oil supply lines are part of a pressurized system and, therefore, lube oil spray
from a leak at a mechanical connection may not be fully captured by this lip and could potentially run down the RCP motor
onto hot Reactor Coolant System (RCS) surfaces.

 The lower RCP motor leak detection system provides detection of water leakage from the RCP motor heat exchanger. Consequently,
this system normally contains cooling water. However, oil may enter into the cooling water either from overfilling
the lube oil reservoir or from leakage at the lower RCP motor bearing. The mixture of water/oil could potentially leak
at the threaded connections of the leak detection system piping and run off onto hot RCS surfaces. It is not expected
that this oil/water mixture would represent a fire hazard under these conditions. These lines are not part of a pressurized
system and are not provided spray protection for this potential leakage site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The lower guide bearing and oil temperature thermocouples are located near the lower RCP motor bearing housing. Each
of these instruments has two threaded connections. One of these connections is at the RCP motor lower bearing oil reservoir
and the other is at the outer end of the thermocouple pipe where the thermocouple is inserted into the pipe. These thermocouple
connections are located in a non-pressurized portion of the lube oil system and are not provided with spray shields.
The innermost connections are located directly over the RCP motor lower oil drain pan and it is expected that leakage
from these connections would be captured by the lower drain pan.

The new oil lubricating system would contain approximately 200 gallons of oil and would eliminate one of the two lift
pumps and its components, which should result in a decrease in the number of potential leakage sites. Of the four potential
leakage sites, ARD vents and lower RCP motor leak detection system piping do not contain oil under routine operating
conditions. The upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD are pressurized only during a brief period of motor
startups and shutdowns. The lower guide bearing thermocouple wells are passive in nature. If leakage were to occur
during normal plant operations, the oil would channel to the drain pan. Any lobe oil leak which may not have been fully
captured could potentially run down the RCP motor onto hot Reactor Coolant System surfaces. However, the flammability
characteristics of the oil, flashpoint of 452
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, and an auto ignition temperature of 500
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F&hyph;700
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, that would be used in the lube oil system, reduce the likelihood that the oil will readily ignite upon coming
in contact with hot RCS piping surfaces. Additionally, if the oil leak became ignited, the fire would be localized
in the area of the leakage and detected by the thermal fire detectors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fire protection features for the RCP motors include three temperature heat detectors with 190
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F setpoints located over each RCP. Any localized fire in the area would result in an alarm function in both the
reactor building and annunciate in the main control room. Additional indications of potential RCP fire are provided
by control room alarms on low level oil, low oil pressure or high vibrations. It is expected that the control room operators
would evaluate these alarms associated with the RCP and its lube oil system and initiate fire brigade entry into the
reactor building to investigate and fight the fire. The reactor building is equipped with an internal firefighting
standpipe hose station system and fire extinguishers are appropriately distributed throughout the structure.
RCP firefighting would be accomplished by using either portable fire extinguishers or water from a hose stream or
a combination of both. Access to the four RCPs for firefighting can be accomplished by making entry into the ``D'' rings.

The existing Crystal River Unit 3 RCP motor lube oil system in a nonseismic system. The new RCP lube oil system and lube
oil collection systems would be seismically qualified to withstand an SSE. Therefore, if an SSE were to occur, the
system is not expected to fail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the design features of the new RCP motors and associated lube oil collection systems, there is reasonable
assurance that the RCP lube oil system will not lead to fire during normal and design basis accident conditions or present
a major fire hazard during a seismic event. In addition, based on the present level of fire protection provided for
the RCPs and the fact that the plant has a trained fire brigade, if a fire were to occur in the area of RCP lube oil system
ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower
guide bearing thermocouple wells, there is reasonable assurance that the fire condition will be detected and mitigated.

For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's proposed implementation of the RCP lube
oil system with the four potential leakage sites (the ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD,
lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells not equipped with an oil collection
system) will not present an undue risk to public health and safety and is consistent with the common defense and security.
The NRC staff has determined that there are special circumstances present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such
that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. 0, as it relates to the oil collection at four specific sites
in the RCP, is not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), an exemption is authorized by law,
will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants Florida Power Corporation an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
R, Section III. 0, relating to oil collection in the RCP. This exemption is applicable only to the four potential leakage
sites in the RCP lube oil system: the ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak
detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 48338).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the National Performance Review which, among other
things, required the Administration to simplify the procurement process by rewriting the FAR, shifting from rigid
rules to guiding principles. As a first step, the Board drafted a set of core guiding principles intended to define
and guide the Government's general vision for the Federal acquisition process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board requested comments on the set of core guiding principles and the accompanying discussion through a notice
issued in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 published on May 24, 1994. As a result of that notice the Board received approximately 50 comments from 19 different
commentors. The comments ranged from general structural to specific substantive changes. Some editing was done
and the Board added a new principle to the statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the more significant changes included: the document was retitled as ``Statement of Guiding Principles For
The Federal Acquisition System''; the success paragraph was eliminated; the lead-in to the goals paragraph was changed;
the term ``customer'' was clarified; the phrase ``each level of the process'' was changed to ``throughout the process'';
the phrase ``using commercial products and services in preference to unique specification'' was replaced with ``maximizing
the use of commercial products and services to meet Government requirements''; and the term ``vendor'' was replaced
with ``contractor.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these changes the Board is considering another concept under the role of the acquisition team. The intent
of the Board is to make it clear that if a policy is not specifically addressed in the FAR, members of the Government acquisition
team should not assume that it is prohibited. This concept was added to encourage members of the team to innovate in
the course of their procurements.

Statement of Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The VISION for the Federal Acquisition System is to deliver on a timely basis the best value product or service to the
customer, while maintaining the public's trust and fulfilling public policy objectives. Participants in the acquisition
process should work together as a team and should be empowered to make decisions within their area of responsibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Acquisition System will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*Satisfy the customer in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service, by, for example,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
**Maximizing the use of commercial products and services,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
**Using contractors with a track record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability
to perform, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
**Promoting competition;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*Minimize administrative operating costs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*Conduct business with integrity, fairness, and openness; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*Fulfill public policy objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acquisition team consists of all participants in Government acquisition including not only representatives
of the technical, supply and procurement communities but also the customers they serve, and the contractors who provide
the products and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The role of each member of the Acquisition Team is to exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing
the best value product or service to meet the customer's needs. In exercising initiative, members of the Government
acquisition team may assume that if a specific policy or procedure is not prohibited by the FAR, law (statute or case
law), Executive Order or other regulation, that the policy or procedure is a permissible exercise of authority.

Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Statement of Acquisition Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System (System) represents a concise
statement designed to be user-friendly for all participants in Government acquisition. The following discussion
of the principles is provided in order to illuminate the meaning of the terms and phrases used. The framework for the
System includes the Guiding Principles for the System and the supporting policies and procedures provided in the
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

Vision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All participants in the System are responsible for making acquisition decisions that deliver the best value product
or service to the customer. Best value must be viewed from a broad perspective and is achieved by balancing the many
competing interests in the System. The result is a system which works better and costs less.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Satisfy the Customer in Terms of Cost, Quality, and Timeliness of the Delivered Product or Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal customers for the product or service provided by the System are the users and line managers, acting on
behalf of the American taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The System must be responsive and adaptive to customer needs, concerns, and feedback. Implementation of acquisition
policies and procedures, as well as consideration of timeliness, quality, and cost throughout the process, must
take into account the perspective of the user of the product or service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When selecting contractors to provide products or perform services, the government will use contractors who have
a track record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability to perform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The government must not hesitate to communicate with the commercial sector as early as possible in the acquisition
cycle to help the government determine the capabilities available in the commercial marketplace. The government
will maximize its use of commercial products and services in meeting Government requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the System to promote competition in the acquisition process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The System must perform in a timely, high quality, and cost-effective manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All members of the Team are required to employ planning as an integral part of the overall process of acquiring products
or services. Although advance planning is required, each member of the Team must be flexible in order to accommodate
changing or unforeseen mission needs. Planning is a tool for the accomplishment of tasks, and application of its discipline
should be commensurate with the size and nature of a given task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Minimize Administrative Operating Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that maximum efficiency is obtained, rules, regulations, and policies should be promulgated only
when their benefits clearly exceed the costs of their development, implementation, administration, and enforcement.
This applies to internal administrative processes, including reviews, and to rules and procedures applied to the
contractor community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The System must provide uniformity where it contributes to efficiency or where fairness or predictability is essential.
The System should also, however, encourage innovation, and local adaptation where uniformity is not essential.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Conduct Business With Integrity, Fairness, and Openness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An essential consideration in every aspect of the System is maintaining the public's trust. Not only must the System
have integrity, but the actions of each member of the Team must reflect that integrity. The foundation of integrity
within the System is a competent, experienced, and well-trained, professional workforce. Accordingly, each member
of the Team is responsible and accountable for the wise use of public resources as well as acting in a manner which maintains
the public's trust. Fairness and openness require open communication among team members, internal and external
customers, and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve efficient operations, the System must shift its focus from ``risk avoidance'' to one of ``risk management.''
The cost to the taxpayer of attempting to eliminate all risk is prohibitive. The Executive Branch will accept and manage
the risk associated with empowering local procurement officials to take independent action based on their professional
judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Fulfill Public Policy Objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The System must support the attainment of public policy goals adopted by the Congress and the President. In attaining
these goals, and in its overall operations, the process shall ensure the efficient use of public resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

Acquisition Team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of defining the Federal Acquisition Team (Team) in the Acquisition Guiding Principles is to ensure that
participants in the System are identified_beginning with the customer and ending with the contractor of the product
or service. By identifying the team members in this manner, teamwork, unity of purpose and open communication among
the members of the Team in sharing the vision and achieving the goal of the System are encouraged. Individual team members
will participate in the acquisition process at the appropriate time.

Role of the Acquisition Team
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Members of the Government Acquisition Team must be empowered to make acquisition decisions within their areas of
responsibility, including selection, negotiation, and administration of contracts consistent with the Guiding
Principles. In particular, the Contracting Officer must have the authority, to the maximum extent practicable and
consistent with law, to determine the application of rules, regulations, and policies, to a specific contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority to make decisions and the accountability for the decisions made will be delegated to the lowest level
within the System, consistent with law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Team must be prepared to perform the functions and duties assigned. The government is committed to provide training,
professional development, and other resources necessary for maintaining and improving the knowledge, skills,
and abilities for all Government participants on the Team, both with regard to their particular area of responsibility
within the System, and their respective role as a team member. The contractor community is encouraged to do likewise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The System will foster cooperative relationships between the government and its contractors consistent with its
overriding responsibility to the taxpayers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR outlines procurement policies and procedures that are used by members of the acquisition team. If a policy
or procedure is not specifically addressed in the FAR, Government members of the Team should not assume it is prohibited.
Rather, absence of direction should be interpreted as permitting the Team to innovate and use sound business judgment
that is otherwise consistent with law and within the limits of their authority.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has determined to terminate action taken under section 301 of the Trade
Act of 1974 on certain entries of softwood lumber products from Canada. The USTR is taking this action in light of the
completion of binational panel proceedings under Chapter 19 of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement concerning
countervailing duty (CVD) determinations involving Canadian softwood lumber. During these proceedings, the binational
panel directed the Department of Commerce to determine that imports of softwood lumber did not receive countervailable
subsidies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the termination of the Section 301 action, the Customs Service will: cease the extension of liquidation
that was ordered pursuant to Section 301 on softwood lumber from Canada that entered from October 4, 1991 to March 12,
1992; de-obligate bonds collected on those entries pursuant to Section 301; and assess no Section 301 duties on those
entries.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 15, 1986, the United States and Canada concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which, among
other things, Canada agreed to impose a 15 percent export charge on certain softwood lumber products exported to the
United States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 3, 1991, Canada announced that it would unilaterally terminate the MOU in 30 days. In response, on October
4, 1991, Commerce announced that it would self-initiate a CVD investigation on softwood lumber from Canada. On the
same date, USTR initiated an investigation under section 301, and determined under section 301(b) that Canada's
acts, policies and practices in terminating the MOU were unreasonable and burdened or restricted U.S. commerce.
56 Fed. Reg. 50738 (October 8, 1991). USTR further determined that action was appropriate pursuant to section 304
to restore and maintain the status quo ante pending issuance of a preliminary CVD determination, and, if warranted,
to impose duties to offset the effects of any subsidies found in the investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USTR directed the Customs Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to: (1) impose bonding requirements on certain softwood lumber from Canada entering between October 4, 1991 and the
date of Commerce's preliminary CVD determination; (2) withhold or extend, as appropriate, liquidation of all such
entries of softwood lumber until the imposition of duties; and (3) collect Section 301 duties at the rate specified
in the MOU or the rate of subsidy found in the final Commerce CVD determination, whichever was lower. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USTR later issued an amended notice of initiation containing certain technical corrections to its original notice.
56 Fed. Reg. 58944 (Nov. 22, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 12, 1992, Commerce published its preliminary CVD determination. On May 28, 1992, Commerce published its
final CVD determination, and determined an estimated subsidy rate of 6.51 per cent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ad valorem. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the domestic industry and affected Canadian parties appealed the final determination to binational panels
established pursuant to Chapter 19 of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, on September 28, 1992, USTR published notice of a modification of the Section 301 action. 57 Fed. Reg. 44609
(Sept. 28, 1992). USTR directed Customs to inform importers that they may request extension of liquidation on entries
covered by the Section 301 action, and that ``any entries extended pursuant to such a request will be assessed 301 duties
in accordance with the outcome of chapter 19 proceedings (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at the lower of the applicable MOU rate or the Commerce rate at the conclusion of chapter 19 proceedings).'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

at 44610.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 6, 1993, the binational panel remanded the CVD determination to Commerce to reexamine certain of its findings.
On September 17, 1993, Commerce responded by issuing a remand determination, finding a subsidy rate of 11.54 per cent

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ad valorem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On December 17, 1993, the panel issued a second decision, again remanding the determination to Commerce, but this
time with instructions to determine that countervailable subsidies were not being provided to Canadian producers
of softwood lumber. On January 6, 1994, Commerce issued a second remand decision, complying with the panel's instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 23, 1994, the panel affirmed Commerce's second remand determination. The binational panel's decision
became final on March 17, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 12584 (March 17, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1994, USTR filed a request for the establishment of an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC) pursuant
to FTA Article 1904.13. The request challenged the panel's substantive determination as well as the conduct of two
of the five panelists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 3, 1994, the ECC, by a two-to-one decision, affirmed the panel's decision. On August 16, 1994, Commerce published
notice of revocation of the CVD order on softwood lumber from Canada and termination of the suspension of liquidation
on softwood lumber entered on or after March 17, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 42029 (Aug. 16, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USTR's previous notice of September 1992 indicated that covered entries would be assessed Section 301 duties at the
lower of the MOU rate or the Commerce subsidy rate at the conclusion of Chapter 19 proceedings. Chapter 19 proceedings
have now concluded with a determination of no countervailable subsidies. Accordingly, no Section 301 duties will
be assessed on the covered entries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Customs Service is therefore directed to: cease the extension of liquidation that was ordered pursuant to Section
301 on softwood lumber from Canada that entered from October 4, 1991 to March 12, 1992; de-obligate bonds collected
on those entries pursuant to Section 301; and assess no Section 301 duties on those entries. This action pertains only
to the Section 301 action and is unrelated to the disposition of cash deposits collected pursuant to the lumber CVD
order itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section 307, the USTR may modify or terminate action, subject to the direction, if any, of the President, if,
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the action was taken under section 301(b) and the USTR finds the action no longer to be appropriate. USTR has consulted
with representatives of the affected domestic industry regarding this action.

Public Comment: Requirements for Submissions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 307(a)(2) requires USTR to provide an opportunity for comment by interested parties affected by a termination
of action concerning the effects of the termination and whether the termination is appropriate. Accordingly, all
interested persons affected by this termination may submit written comments concerning it. USTR will consider any
comments submitted.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 19, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'',)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of Quarterly Index Expiration, Capped Style Options
(``Q&hyph;CAPS'') based on the Standard &amp; Poor's (``S&amp;P'') 100 and 500 Stock Indexes. On May 18, 1994, the
CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposal to provide for certain standards to be used with respect
to the aggregation of FLEX options and Q&hyph;CAPS for purposes of FLEX option position limits.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 On May 27, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2'') to clarify that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to
the same rules that govern capped-style options (``CAPS'').
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 On September 16, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 3 (``Amendment No. 3'') to clarify aggregation concerns with respect
to options overlying the same index. On September 28, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 4 (``Amendment No. 4'') to
incorporate the substance of Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3 into the CBOE Rule book.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 This order approves the CBOE's proposal, as amended.

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. CAPS and QIX Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A capped-style option is an option that will be automatically exercised prior to expiration if the exercise settlement
value
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 for the option on any trading day equals or exceeds (in the case of calls) or equals or is less than (in the case of puts),
the cap price for the option.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 CAPS based on the S&amp;P 100 index (``OEX''), S&amp;P 500 index (``SPX'') and the Russell 2000 index are currently
listed for trading on the CBOE. Quarterly Index Expiration (``QIX'') options generally have the same contract terms
as regular options, except that they expire on the first business day of the month following the end of a calendar quarter.

A Q&hyph;CAP is an option possessing the same attributes as a capped-style index option contract that expires on the
first business day of the month following the end of a calendar quarter. Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same rules
that presently govern the trading of existing CAPS, including, as more fully discussed below, position limits, exercise
limits,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 the setting of cap price intervals

For purposes of the Exchange's position limit framework, the CBOE proposes that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the
same position limits as standard CAPS. Accordingly, (1) Q&hyph;CAPS will be aggregated with and treated identically
to A.M. Settled, European-style option contracts on the S&amp;P 500 Index, including CAPS and QIX options on the S&amp;P
500, for all position limit purposes, including being subject to the 25,000 contract index arbitrage limit;
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 (2) Q&hyph;CAPS on the S&amp;P 100 Index will be treated like all other OEX options, including CAPS and QIX options,
for all position limit purposes, except for the requirement that limits the number of contracts in the series of any
broad-based index option with the nearest expiration (``telescoping requirement'').
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, aggregate P.M. Settled FLEX options based on the same index (i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OEX or SPX), with the same expiration date as QIXs and Q&hyph;CAPS will be aggregated.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Q&hyph;CAPS will also be subject to the same hedge exemptions applicable to QIXs and CAPS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5),
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 and, therefore, approves the Exchange's proposal and grants accelerated approval of the amendments thereto. In
particular, the Commission believes that Q&hyph;CAPS will provide additional choice and flexibility to investors
in their use of derivatives and provide a tailored quarterly portfolio hedge that may be more suitable to their investment
needs by allowing them to participate in the options markets at predetermined maximum gains or losses, on a quarterly
basis. The Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to set a cap interval of 30 in that the cap price is placed
sufficiently far from the exercise price so that the Q&hyph;CAPS will not be exercised automatically on a frequent
basis.

In addition, both the CBOE and the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') have represented that they have the
necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of
Q&hyph;CAPS. Telephone conversation between Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, CBOE, and Stephen M.
Youhn, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, on September 20, 1994; and Memorandum from Joe Corrigan, Executive
Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, CBOE, dated September 20, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also believes the CBOE's proposal to ``bring up'' new at-the-money series of Q&hyph;CAPS every three
months and/or after significant market movements is consistent with the Act because it will not result in a significant
proliferation of options series. Finally, the Commission notes that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same margin
requirements as CAPS. Due to the economic similarities of the two products and because the Commission has previously
approved the margin rules applicable to CAPS, no new or unique regulatory concerns are raised by extending this margin
treatment to Q&hyph;CAPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also notes that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same position and exercise limit requirements that
currently apply to CAPS. In particular, Q&hyph;CAPS on the SPX will be aggregated with SPX CAPS, SPX QIX options, and
all other A.M. Settled SPX contracts, subject to a 45,000 contract limit under Rule 24.4(b), with a 25,000 contract
limit for index arbitrage.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Q&hyph;CAPS on the OEX, under Rule 24.4(c), will be aggregated with OEX CAPS, OEX QIX options, and all other A.M. Settled
OEX contracts, subject to a 25,000 contract limitation, however, with no telescoping requirement. The Commission
also finds that, consistent with the treatment of CAPS, it is appropriate to exclude Q&hyph;CAPS from exercise limit
requirements because holders have no control over when their positions will be exercised, except on the last business
day before expiration of the options.

Specifically, CBOE Rule 24.4(b) states that no more than 25,000 contracts may be used for the purpose of taking advantage
of any differential in price between the S&amp;P 500 Index and the securities underlying the S&amp;P 500. See also
Amendment No. 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that Q&hyph;CAPS will have their exercise settlement value based upon the closing prices of
component stocks on the last business day of the quarter. Although the Commission continues to believe that basing
the settlement of index products on opening, as opposed to closing, prices on Expiration Fridays helps alleviate
stock market volatility,
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 these concerns are reduced in the case of Q&hyph;CAPS, since expiration of these stock index options will not correspond
to the normal expiration of stock index option, stock index futures and options on stock index futures.

In particular, Q&hyph;CAPS will never expire on an ``Expiration Friday'' or any other ``Expiration Fridays'' in
March, June, September and December, thereby diminishing any impact that Q&hyph;CAPS could have on the market. Accordingly,
the Commission preliminarily believes that Q&hyph;CAPS will not compromise the protection of investors or have
an adverse market effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Amendment No. 1 addresses aggregation concerns with respect to P.M. Settled FLEX options by amending CBOE Rule 24A&hyph;7
to require aggregation of positions in P.M. Settled FLEX options with positions in Q&hyph;CAPS and QIXs based on the
same index with the same expiration date. This amendment helps to prevent any resulting increase in position limits
relating to P.M. Settled FLEX options and should help prevent an investor from using FLEX options for the purpose of
avoiding the position limits applicable to QIXs and Q&hyph;CAPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment No. 2 states that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same rules that currently govern CAPS regarding position
and exercise limits and margin requirements. Additionally, the amendment provides that the listing of Q&hyph;CAPS
with expirations greater than 12 months will require the filing of a rule proposal with the Commission, and approval
of such filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 2 helps to clarify
the rules and procedures applicable to the listing and trading Q&hyph;CAPS and contains only minor variations from
the original proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment No. 3 explains that Q&hyph;CAPS, CAPS, QIXs and standard options positions on the S&amp;P 100 and 500, respectively,
will be aggregated for determining position limit compliance. The Commission believes this amendment clarifies
existing CBOE Rule 24.4 and helps to ensure that Q&hyph;CAPS comply with the existing position limit framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment No. 4 incorporates the substance of Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3 into the CBOE's Rule book. Accordingly, the
Commission does not believe the amendment raises any new or unique regulatory concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve Amendment
Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the CBOE's proposal on an accelerated basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 23, 1993, the Commission approved a proposed rule change filed by OCC which proposed to accommodate the
clearance and settlement of flexibly structured index options.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Flexibly structured index options exhibit virtually the same characteristics as regular index options; therefore,
OCC establishes long and short flexibly structured index option positions in clearing member accounts in precisely
the same way it currently does for regular index options. OCC incorporates flexibly structured index options in its
premium settlement, margin collection, exercise notice, exercise assignment, and exercise/expiration statement
processes without significant changes to those processes. Premiums and exercise prices for the flexibly structured
index options that are currently being traded are denominated in United States dollars. Parties to a transaction
in such an option may customize certain terms of the option including: the expiration date, the exercise style, the
exercise price, the cap interval in the case of capped-style options, and the method to be used for establishing the
current index value for purposes of settling expiration date exercises.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31912 (February 23, 1993), 58 FR 11879 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;33]
(order approving proposed rule change relating to flexibly structured index options).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new flexibly structured index option product to be traded at the CBOE is similar to the existing flexibly structured
index option product in that the underlying interest is an index and the parties to a transaction may customize certain
terms of the option. However, the new product will have premiums and exercise prices denominated in foreign currencies
rather than in United States dollars.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, this new product is being called Flexibly Structured Index Options Denominated in a Foreign Currency
(``FX Index Options'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Premium and exercise prices for these non-United States dollars flexibly structured index options may be denominated
in any of the foreign currencies currently underlying foreign currency options. Those currencies include: (1) Australian
dollars, (2) British pounds, (3) Canadian dollars, (4) European Economic Community currency units, (5) French francs,
(6) German Deutsche marks, (7) Japanese yen and (8) Swiss francs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To accommodate the clearance and settlement of FX Index Options, a new Article, Article XXIII, will be added to the
OCC By-Laws. Because FX Index Options are a type of index option, the OCC By-Laws governing index options, Article
XVII, will be incorporated into new Article XXIII and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. In addition, because
FX Index Options will settle in a foreign currency, certain of the OCC By-Laws governing Cross-Rate Foreign Currency
Options in Article XX also are being incorporated into new Article XXIII where appropriate. For example, those By-Laws
governing extraordinary events, adjustments, and the payment of premiums will be incorporated into the new article.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Chapter XXIV will be added the OCC Rules to accommodate FX Index Options. FX Index Options will be exercised pursuant
to the rules governing existing index options. Accordingly, the rules governing exercise, assignment, allocation,
and the exercise settlement date from Chapter XVIII, which pertains to index options, will be incorporated into new
Chapter XXIV and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. In addition, the settlement procedure for FX Index Options
will be the same as the procedure for existing index options. Exercised FX Index Options will be settled through the
payment of an exercise settlement amount, which is the difference between the aggregate exercise price and the aggregate
current index value. Accordingly, the rules governing exercise settlement and the exercise settlement date from
Chapter XVIII will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. Because FX
Index Options will settle in a foreign currency, certain settlement obligations of a party to a FX Index Option contract
will be similar to the settlement obligations of a party to a cross-rate foreign currency option contract. Therefore,
certain rules governing settlement obligations from Chapter XXI, which pertains to cross-rate foreign currency
options, will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV. Specifically, these include the obligation to set up bank accounts
and the consequence of failing to pay a foreign currency. Finally, FX Index Options will be margined like cross-rate
foreign currency options in that the margin requirement will be calculated in the applicable trading currency and
then converted to United States dollars. Consequently, the language of Rule 2111 governing margin requirements
for cross-rate foreign currency options will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional changes to the OCC By-Laws and an additional change to OCC's Rules also will be made. Specifically,
the term ``FX index option clearing member'' will be added to the definition of ``clearing member'' in Article I, Section
1 of the By-Laws. In addition, the reference to the term ``FLEX'' in the definition of clearing member will be changed
to ``flexibly structured option'' in order to make that term more generic. Finally, OCC Rule 401 will be amended to
require that the currency in which the option is denominated, the expiration date of the option contract as opposed
to the month, and the cap price, if any, be included in the Report of Matched Trades.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act because
it provides for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in flexibly structured index options
denominated in a foreign currency and because it provides for the safeguarding of related securities and funds. The
proposed rule change meets such requirements by establishing a framework in which existing OCC systems, rules, and
procedures are extended to the processing of the new FX Index Options.

Applicants' Representations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is a newly formed non-diversified closed-end management company that has
elected to operate as a business development company under the Act. The Company has filed a registration statement
on Form N&hyph;2 (File No. 33&hyph;50424) with respect to an initial public offering of its common stock. The registration
statement has not yet been declared effective by the SEC. The Company's primary investment objective will be to achieve
long-term capital appreciation through controlling (25% or greater) investments in ``eligible portfolio companies''
(as defined in the Act). The Company will invest in portfolio companies with viable existing businesses generating
substantial revenues in established markets, but that have recently completed, are in the process of undergoing,
or are likely to undergo, a financial restructuring pursuant to bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings or on a
negotiated basis outside of bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers
Act''). The Company has retained the Investment Adviser as the Company's investment adviser to identify, negotiate,
manage and liquidate investments for the Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Martin D. Sass and Hugh R. Lamle, who are officers and directors of the Company, are principal stockholders, officers
and directors of the Investment Adviser. James B. Rubin, an officer and director of the Company and Martin E. Winter,
an officer of the Company, are also officers of the Investment Adviser. In addition, Messrs. Sass and Lamle are principal
stockholders, officers, and directors of two other investment advisers registered under the Advisers Act, M.D.
Sass Associates, Inc. (``Associates'') and M.D. Sass Management, Inc. (``Management''). Messrs. Rubin and Winter
are also officers of Associates and Management. The Investment Adviser, Associates and Management control other
entities engaged in investing primarily in financially distressed companies (the ``M.D. Sass Funds'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. None of the M.D. Sass Funds has made or presently proposes to make a public offering of its securities. Each of the
M.D. Sass Funds: (a) Is exempt from registration under the Act pursuant to section 3(c)(1) because its outstanding
securities are beneficially owned by less than 100 persons; or (b) is not subject to registration under section 7(d)
because it is not organized or otherwise created under the laws of the United States or any state and has not made use
of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with any public offering of its securities.
The M.D. Sass Funds and those entities not subject to the registration requirements of the Act that may be subsequently
created or otherwise organized by the Investment Adviser or affiliates of the Investment Adviser are referred to
as the ``M.D. Sass Affiliates.'' The Company proposes to co-invest with the M.D. Sass Affiliates in order to acquire
a diversified portfolio of investments and to compete effectively for such investments with larger entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder provide, among other things, that it shall be unlawful for an affiliate
person of an investment company, or an affiliated of such person, acting as principal, to participate in any joint
enterprise or other joint arrangement in which any such investment company is a participant, unless the SEC has issued
an order approving the joint enterprise or arrangement. Section 57(a)(4) applies the same prohibitions to affiliated
persons of a business development company. Section 57(i) applies the rules adopted under section 17(d) to business
development companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicants submit that the substantive ongoing obligations imposed on the independent directors of the Company
provide significant protection to investors against possible conflicts of interest in co-investments by the applicants
and the M.D. Sass Affiliates. Applicants also believe that the proposed conditions applicable to the operations
of the Company governing the terms on which co-investments may be made and the disposition of investments held by any
affiliate that co-invests with the Company (including the conditions set forth herein) are consistent with the policies
underlying the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that the order shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Before a co-investment transaction is effected, the Investment Adviser must make an initial determination on
behalf of the Company regarding investment suitability. Following this determination, the Investment Adviser
will make a written investment presentation regarding the proposed co-investment to the independent directors
of the Company. Such information will include the identity of each affiliate that proposes to co-invest with the Company
(collectively, including the Company, the ``Co-Investors'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The independent directors of the Company will review the Investment Adviser's initial determination. In doing
so, the independent directors will request such additional information from the Investment Adviser as they deem
necessary to the exercise of their reasonable business judgment, and will employ such experts, including lawyers
and accountants, as they deem appropriate. Prior to committing to a co-investment, a ``required majority'' (as defined
in section 57(o) of the Act) of the independent directors of the Company must conclude that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The terms, of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the stockholders
and the Company and do not involve overreaching of the stockholders and the Company on the part of any person concerned;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The transaction is consistent with the interests of the stockholders of the Company and is consistent with the
investment objective and policies of the Company as recited in its Registration Statement filed under the Securities
Act of 1933 and subsequent reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The investment by one or more of the other Co-Investors would not disadvantage the Company in the making of such
investment, maintaining its investment position, or disposing of such investment and that participation by the
Company would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other Co-Investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The other Co-Investors will be permitted to invest only to the extent that the total investment opportunity exceeds
the amount that the Company determines to invest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Co-Investments in securities by the Company with any other Co-Investor will consist of the same class of securities
including the same registration rights (if any) and other rights related thereto, purchased at the same price on the
same settlement date, and the approval of such transaction by the Company's independent directors will be made in
the same time period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If any Co-Investor determines to make an additional investment in an issuer whose securities were purchased in
a co-investment transaction (a ``Follow-On Investment''), notice of the proposed Follow-On Investment will be
given to the Company at the earliest practical time. Follow-on investments will be reviewed, approved, allocated,
and disposed of in the same manner as prescribed for initial co-investments under these conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No co-investment will be made in the securities of any entity if any Co-Investor has previously acquired a security
issued by such entity provided that this prohibition shall not apply to Follow-On Investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If any Co-Investor elects to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any interest in a security purchased in a co-investment
transaction, notice of the proposed disposition will be given to the Company at the earliest practical time. The Investment
Adviser will provide a written recommendation to the independent directors of the Company concerning the proposed
disposition. The Company will participate in the disposition at the same time as the other Co-Investors, on a proportionate
basis, and on the same terms and conditions: provided that a required majority of the independent directors may decide
that the Company will not participate in the proposed disposition or will dispose of less than its proportionate interest
if they determine that such action is in the best interest of the Company, is reasonable and fair to the stockholders
and the Company, and does not involve overreaching of the stockholders and the Company on the part of any person concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The independent directors of the Company will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning co-investment
transactions made by the Co-Investors, including co-investment transactions in which the Company has declined
to participate, so that they may determine whether all co-investment transactions made during the preceding quarter,
including those co-investment transactions that were declined, complied with the conditions set forth above. In
addition, the independent directors of the Company will consider at least quarterly the continuing appropriateness
of the standards established for co-investment transactions by the Company, including whether use of the standards
continues to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders and does not involve overreaching of the Company
and its stockholders on the part of any party concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The independent directors of the Company will maintain the records described in section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if
each of the transactions permitted under these conditions were approved by the independent directors of the Company
under section 57(f). In addition, the Company will maintain, at its office, written records detailing the factors
considered in each of its determinations or recommendations referred to in these conditions. All records referred
to or required under these conditions will be available for inspection by the Commission and will be preserved permanently,
the first two years in an easily accessible place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. No independent director of the Company shall participate in the consideration of any aspect of a co-investment
transaction if he is affiliated with an M.D. Sass Affiliate that proposes to participate or has participated in the
transaction.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. USAA Life was organized under Texas law as a stock life insurance company and is the depositor, for purposes of the
1940 Act, of the Account. USAA Life will be the depositor of any Other Account established by it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Account was established under Texas law as an insurance company separate account, and is registered under the
1940 Act as a unit investment trust. That portion of the assets of the Account equal to the reserves and other Contract
liabilities of the Account will not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business USAA Life may
conduct. Any income, gains, or losses, realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Account will be, in accordance
with the Contracts, credited to or charged against the Account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of
USAA Life. The Account currently is divided into seven variable fund accounts (the ``Variable Fund Accounts'), all
of which will initially be available under the Contracts. Five of the Variable Fund Accounts will invest solely in
the shares of five corresponding funds of USA Life Investment trust, which is registered under the 1940 Act as a diversified
open-end management investment company. One Variable Fund Account will invest solely in the shares of the Capital
Growth Portfolio of Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund, an open-end management investment company. Another
Variable Fund Account will invest solely in the shares of the Alger American Growth Portfolio of the Alger American
Fund, an open-end management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Contracts will be distributed through USAA IMCO, which is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contracts will be flexible premium deferred combination fixed and variable annuity contracts to be issued
by USAA Life on an individual basis. The Contracts are designed to provide retirement payments and other long-term
benefits for persons covered under plans qualified for federal income tax advantages available under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, and for persons desiring such benefits who do not qualify for such tax advantages. The Contracts
will have a Fixed Fund Account option that will be funded through USAA Life's general account. USAA Life assesses a
Contract maintenance charge of $30 per year against each Contract at each Contract anniversary or at the time of a full
withdrawal from the Contract. The annual Contract maintenance charge will be made only during the accumulation phase
of the Contract. Under all Contracts, USAA Life will assess each Variable fund Account with an administrative expense
charge, on a daily basis, at an effective rate of 0.10% per annum of the average net assets. The administrative expense
charge will be imposed during both the accumulation and distribution phases. Neither the contract maintenance charge
nor the administrative expense charge may be raised during the life of a Contract. USAA Life does not expect that the
total revenues from such administrative charges under the Contracts will exceed the expected costs of administering
the Contracts, on average, excluding costs that are properly categorized as distribution expenses, over the period
that the Contracts are in force. No sales charge is collected or deducted under the Contracts, although a charge will
be assessed on full or partial withdrawals or on transfers from USAA Life's general account under specified circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. USAA Life proposes to compensate itself for assuming certain insurance risks under the Contracts by deducting
from the assets of the Account a daily charge for mortality and expense risks.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mortality and expense risk charge would be a daily net asset charge at an aggregate nominal rate of 1.05% per annum,
consisting of approximately .70% for mortality risks and .35% for expense risks. USAA Life will assume a mortality
risk arising from its obligation to pay a death benefit prior to the annuity date. The death benefit payable is the greater
of (a) the monetary value of the Contract (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the sum of the Contract values invested in the Variable Fund Accounts and in USAA Life's general account) on the date
USAA Life receives proof of death or (b) the sum of all premium payments credited to the Contract, less the amount of
any withdrawals and less any applicable premium tax. USAA Life assumes an additional mortality risk by its contractual
obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the annuitant under annuity options that involve
life contingencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In addition to mortality risks, USAA Life will assume an expense risk because the administrative charges under
the Contract, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to cover actual administrative expenses. In this regard,
USAA Life agrees not to raise, for the duration of the Contracts, the daily net asset value charge of 0.10% for administrative
expenses and the annual Contract maintenance charge in the amount of $30 per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The order requested by Applicants would apply to the Contracts and also to substantially similar contracts issued
by the Account or by any Other Account.

27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from
selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian
having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides
that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable
amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed
mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants propose to assess against the assets of the Account a daily mortality and expense risk charge at an aggregate
rate of 1.05% per annum. USAA Life guarantees that it will not raise the charge for the duration of the Contracts. USAA
Life expects to make a profit from this charge. Applicants represent that the level of the mortality and expense risk
charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. Applicants state that they have
reviewed publicly-available information regarding products of other companies, taking into consideration such
factors as guaranteed minimum death benefits, guaranteed annuity purchase rates, minimum initial and subsequent
premium payments, other contract charges, the manner in which charges are imposed, market sector, investment options
under the contracts, and availability to individual qualified and nonqualified plans. Based upon this review, Applicants
have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of charges determined by industry practice.
With respect to any Contracts offered by it, USAA Life will maintain at its principal offices a memorandum setting
forth in detail the variable annuity products analyzed and the methodology, and results, of Applicants' comparative
review. USAA Life will make this memorandum available to the Commission and its staff upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the expenses and cost assumed, the loss will be
borne by USAA Life. Conversely, if the charge deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to USAA
Life. USAA Life expects to earn a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants acknowledge that, in the absence of a specified charge for the costs of distributing the Contracts,
all or a portion of any profit realized from the mortality and expense risk charge may be offset by distribution expenses.
In such circumstances, a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion
of the costs relating to distribution of the Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USAA Life has concluded that
there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the
Contracts will benefit the Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by USAA Life at its principal offices and will be made available to the Commission and its staff
upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. USAA Life represents that the Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund that undertakes, in the event
it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan
formulated and approved by a board of trustees, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of
such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants submit that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest, because it would promote competitiveness
in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for Applicants to file redundant exemptive applications,
thereby reducing their administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of their resources.

For the reasons discussed above, Applicants conclude that granting their requested order would be necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA intends to conduct hearings in New Jersey to gather comments on the supplemental draft environmental impact
statement (EIS) released on September 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the analysis phase of the comment period associated with the Draft EIS, new information was developed
by the FAA. Additionally, new information was received from the public during the comment period. Since this information
is pertinent to the decision process leading to issuance of a final EIS, the public should have an opportunity to examine
the new material and comment on it prior to completion of the EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supplemental draft EIS (SDEIS) was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Copies
have been mailed to individuals that participated in the EIS process as well as to libraries in select locations throughout
New Jersey.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period, the FAA will conduct three public hearings in New Jersey to solicit both written and oral

The FAA will consider and respond to all comments directly related to the scope of the SDEIS. The geographic scope delineated
by Congress for the EIS was the environmental effects of the Expanded East Coast Plan over the State of New Jersey and
adjacent coastal waters. Please note, however, that the most useful comments are those which provide facts and analyses
to support the reviewer's recommendations or conclusions on specific topics contained in the document. Should any
comments be received after the close of the comment period, FAA cannot assure they will be considered or addressed
in the final EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will issue a final EIS that will include corrections, clarifications and responses to comments on the SDEIS.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pending approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announces the availability of educational loan repayment under
the NIH Clinical Research Loan Repayment Program for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds (the Program).
The Program, which is authorized by Section 487E of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288&hyph;5), as
added by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43), provides for the repayment
of the educational loan debt of health professionals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, who have substantial
debt relative to income, and who agree to conduct clinical research as employees of the NIH. The Program provides for
the repayment of up to $20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals
for each year of obligated service. The purpose of the Program is the recruitment and retention of highly qualified
health professionals, who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, to clinical research careers at the NIH. Through
this notice, the NIH invites health professionals, who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and interested in engaging
in clinical research as NIH employees for at least two years, to apply for participation in the NIH Clinical Research
Loan Repayment Program for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43) was enacted on June 10, 1993, adding
section 487E of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288&hyph;5). Section 487E authorizes the Secretary
to carry out a program of entering into contracts with appropriately qualified health professionals who are from
disadvantaged backgrounds with substantial educational loan debt relative to income. Under such contracts, qualified
health professionals agree to conduct clinical research as employees of the NIH for at least two years in consideration
of the Federal Government agreeing to repay, for each year of service, not more than $20,000 of the principal and interest
of the educational loans of such health professionals. This program is known as the NIH Clinical Research Loan Repayment
Program for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds (Clinical Research LRP).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific eligibility criteria with regard to participation in the Clinical Research LRP include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Participants must be United States citizens, nationals, or permanent residents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Participants must have a M.D., Ph.D., D.O., D.D.S., D.M.D., A.D.N./B.S.N., or equivalent degree;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Participants must come from a disadvantaged background. An individual from a disadvantaged background is one
who (a) comes from an environment that inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skill, and ability
required to enroll in and graduate from a health professions school or (b) comes from a family with an annual income
below a level based on low-income thresholds according to family size published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, adjusted
annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index, and adjusted by the Secretary for use in all health professions programs.
The Secretary periodically publishes these income levels in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Participants must have qualifying educational debt in excess of 20 percent of their annual NIH salary at their
expected date of program eligibility. In the case of U.S. Commissioned Corps officers, their NIH salary includes
base pay plus quarters, subsistence, and variable housing allowances. Special and bonus pays, such as board certified,
contract, and variable incentive pays, are not considered in the Clinical Research LRP's calculation of salary.
For these employed under the Civil Service, salary does not include Physicians Comparability Allowances (PCAs).
However, PCA recipients who are accepted into the Clinical Research LRP will have their PCAs reduced by the amount
of loan repayments to be received. The expected date of program eligibility is the date by which the following conditions
will be met: (a) An applicant agrees to begin clinical research as a NIH employee, and (b) the Secretary is expected
to execute the Clinical Research LRP contract;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Participants must be employees of the NIH. The following are NOT considered NIH employees: (a) Intramural Research
Training Award (IRTA) recipients, (b) Visiting Fellows, (c) National Research Service Award (NRSA) recipients,
(d) Guest Researchers or Special Volunteers, (e) NIH-National Research Council (NRC) Biotechnology Research Associates
Program participants, and (f) Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) participants;

(6) Participants may be appointed under a temporary or permanent employment mechanism, so long as their employment
in a clinical research assignment has the potential to last a minimum of 2 years; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Individuals with existing service obligations to Federal, State, or other entities will not be considered for
the Program unless and until the existing service obligation is discharged or deferred for the length of Program participation;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Applicants will not be excluded from consideration under the Program on the basis of age, race, culture, religion,
gender, disability, or other non-merit factors.

Selection Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since program participation is contingent upon employment with the NIH, an individual who wishes to apply must obtain
a written commitment from an Institute or Center (IC) Personnel Office of the NIH to be employed in a clinical research
position. The Director, LRP, provides current deadlines, sources for assistance, and additional details regarding
application procedures in an annual Applicant Information Bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals submit their applications to the Director, LRP, who forwards those qualified to the Clinical Research
Loan Repayment Committee (CR&hyph;LRC). The CR&hyph;LRC reviews, ranks, and approves or disapproves Clinical
Research LRP applications. The LRC membership is made up of NIH scientific staff who are nominated by the Deputy Director,
Intramural Research, NIH, and appointed by the Director, NIH. The CR&hyph;LRC is co-chaired by the Associate Director
for Clinical Research, NIH, and the Associate Director for Research on Minority Health, NIH. The CR&hyph;LRC reviews
and selects applications for approval based upon the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The merit of the clinical research assignment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The credentials of both applicant and supervisor and other criteria the Secretary deems appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clinical research activities are the biomedical and behavioral studies of etiology, epidemiology, prevention,
prevention strategies, diagnosis, or treatment of diseases, disorders or conditions, including but not limited
to clinical trials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds for repayment will only be awarded to LRC-approved applications. Priority in funding will be given to qualified
health professionals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and who are underrepresented in biomedical/behavioral
research including members from minority groups, disabled individuals, and women.

Program Administration and Details 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Clinical Research LRP, the NIH will repay a portion of the extant qualified educational loan debt incurred
by health professionals to pay for their undergraduate, graduate, and/or health professional school educational
expenses. Upon application, individuals must have total qualified educational debt which exceeds 20% of their anticipated
annual NIH salary (``debt threshold'') on the date of program eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only qualified loan amounts in excess of 50 percent of the debt threshold will be considered for repayment (``repayable
debt''). The repayable debt of qualified health professionals will be satisfied at the rate of one-half per year,
subject to a statutory limit of $20,000 per year, for each year of obligated service. Obligated service requires selected
individuals to serve at least 2 years as an NIH employee engaged in clinical research. Following conclusion of the
initial two-year contract, participants may apply for renewal contracts to satisfy their remaining repayable debt.
These continuation contracts may be submitted and approved on a year-to-year basis, subject to a finding by NIH that
the applicant's clinical research accomplishments are acceptable. Funding of contracts is contingent upon appropriation
and/or allocation of funds from the U.S. Congress and/or the NIH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In return for the repayment of their educational loans, participants must agree to (1) engage in clinical research
as employees of the NIH for a minimum period of 2 years; (2) make payments to lenders on their own behalf for periods of
Leave Without Pay (LWOP); (3) pay monetary damages as required for breach of contract; and (4) satisfy other terms
and conditions of the Clinical Research LRP's contract and application procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants must submit a signed contract, prepared by the NIH, agreeing to obligated service at the time they apply
for consideration under the Clinical Research LRP. Substantial monetary penalties will be imposed for breach of
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH will repay lenders for the principal, interest, and related expenses (such as the required insurance premiums
on the unpaid balances of some loans) of qualified Government (Federal, State, local) and commercial educational
loans obtained by participants for the following:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Undergraduate, graduate, and health professional school tuition expenses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Other reasonable educational expenses required by the school(s) attended, including fees, books, supplies,
educational equipment and materials, and laboratory expenses; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Reasonable living expenses, including the cost of room and board, transportation and commuting costs, and other
living expenses as determined by the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Repayments will be authorized for direct payment to lenders, following receipt of (1) the supervisor's verification
of completion of the prior period of obligated service and (2) lender verification of the crediting of prior loan repayments,
including the resulting account balances and current account status. The NIH will repay loans in the following order
unless significant savings would result from repaying loans in a different priority order:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) other loans guaranteed by the Federal Government; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) other qualifying loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following loans are NOT repayable under the Clinical Research LRP:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Loans not obtained from a Government entity or commercial or other chartered lending institution, such as loans
from friends and relatives, or other private individuals;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Loans for which contemporaneous documentation is not available; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Loans, or those portions of loans, obtained for educational or living expenses which exceed a ``reasonable''
level as determined by a review of the standard school budget or additional contemporaneous documentation for the
year in which the loan was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for other programs which provide loans, scholarships, loan repayments, or similar awards in exchange
for a future service obligation, the NIH will NOT repay any sums that may result from failure to serve as required or
conversion of the obligation to a loan under these programs. This includes, but is not limited to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Physicians Shortage Area Scholarship Program (Federal or State);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) National Research Service Award Program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Public Health Service and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Armed Forces (Army, Navy, or Air Force) Health Professions Scholarship Programs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Indian Health Service Scholarship Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, payments will not be made under the Clinical Research LRP for loans which participants have already repaid,
delinquent loans, loans in default, loans not current in their payment schedule, or loans for which promissory notes
have been signed after the program eligibility date. During lapses in loan repayments, due either to administrative
complications or a break in service, Clinical Research LRP participants are wholly responsible for making payments
or other arrangements which maintain loans in a current payment status such that increases in either principal or
interest do not occur. Penalties assessed participants as a result of NIH administrative complications may be considered
for reimbursement.
