<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80
series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes, that requires modification of the power transfer unit (PTU). This
amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the drain port housings of the PTU's on several airplanes.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the PTU housing due to fatigue cracking, which could
result in the loss of both hydraulic systems (until the PTU is shut off).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88
airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38146). That action proposed to require modification of the power transfer unit (PTU).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested that the proposed compliance time of ``14,300 flight cycles on the PTU or 9 months after the
effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later,'' be extended. These commenters are concerned that they will be
unable to modify their affected fleets within the proposed compliance time due to a possible problem in the availability
of an ample number of required parts from the manufacturer. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to
extend the compliance time. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not
only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe condition, but the availability of required
parts and the practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval of time allowable
for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. The FAA has been advised that an ample
number of required parts will be available for modification of the U.S. fleet within the proposed compliance period.
However, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA will consider requests for adjustments to
the compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable level
of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicability of the final rule has been revised to delete the reference to Model ``DC&hyph;9&hyph;84 (MD&hyph;84).''
This inclusion of this reference was in error; no such model of airplane exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,074 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 578 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that
it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor
rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $2,912 per airplane. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,752,496, or $3,032 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The FAA estimates that 128 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $42,240, or $330 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen
system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881, 940, and 950 seats installed on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series
aircraft. This AD requires a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration and functioning of the passenger
oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by oxygen canisters
failing to activate due to the installation of incorrect pin release brackets or defective oxygen canister release
pins. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the passenger oxygen system to activate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881,
940, and 950 seats found on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48486). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration
and functioning of the passenger oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. The actions
would be required to be accomplished in accordance with PTC Service Bulletin (SB) No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision D, dated
February 2, 1993, that describes procedures for a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration and functioning
of the passenger oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters state that the compliance time should be reduced, one to six months after the effective date of the AD,
the other to 30 days. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not concur. Neither comment offered engineering
or technical data to support a reduction in the compliance interval from the 15-month compliance time contained in
the proposed rule. The proposed compliance time was determined to provide an acceptable level of safety considering
the maintenance schedules of the operators. Therefore, the FAA has retained the 15-month compliance time in the final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the lanyard length check should be deleted due to difficulty in performing that check. The
FAA concurs that the check was difficult to perform but does not concur in deleting the check. The check is needed to
verify the correct lanyard length. Since publication of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the FAA that the lanyard
length tolerance has been increased to plus or minus .25 inch, which will allow that check to be more easily accomplished.
This tolerance factor has been added to paragraph (a)(3) of this Final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the AD should require repetitive inspections. The FAA does not concur. The one-time inspection,
and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts, required by this AD will obviate the need for repetitive inspections
other than those performed during routine scheduled maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that the AD should contain a requirement for reporting malfunctions. The FAA does not
concur. The one-time inspection, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts, required by this AD will
preclude the need for reporting malfunctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that the SB does not provide adequate work step instructions. The FAA concurs. Since
issuance of the NPRM, PTC Aerospace has issued SB No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994, which contains
clarified work step instructions. The FAA has added this new service bulletin to the AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter further states that the SB should specify a different oxygen canister safety cap. The revised SB specifies
two safety caps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that a functional test should be required prior to disassembly. The FAA does not concur.
The FAA has determined that a functional test prior to disassembly would not provide any benefit in evaluating the
passenger oxygen system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that there should be a snag test on the release pin for grooves and burrs. The FAA does not
concur. The FAA believes that the instructions for testing as stated in the revised SB are adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the FAA that an additional safety cap, Scott Part Number
(P/N) 36425&hyph;00, is available. Also, the manufacturer has added a black plastic grommet, P/N 91880&hyph;2,
on the pin release bracket, and a bushing, P/N 121836&hyph;1, on the activator assembly spring, P/N H13341. Finally,
the manufacturer has included instructions for verifying the gap between the cable actuating lever and the cable
activating lever stop in PTC Aerospace SB No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994. These revised instructions
have been added to the compliance section of this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial estimate in the NPRM of approximately 3,000 passenger oxygen systems of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet was incorrect. The manufacturer has advised the FAA that the revised number is 4,800 passenger oxygen systems
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 4,000 passenger oxygen systems are installed on aircraft of U.S. registry,
of which 2,500 have already been modified, leaving approximately 1,500 passenger oxygen systems that have not yet
been modified in accordance with this AD. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 1 work hour per passenger
oxygen system to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts
will cost approximately $20 per passenger oxygen system. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on
U.S. operators is estimated to be $112,500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Applicability: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881, 940, and 950 seats, installed
on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of the passenger oxygen system to activate, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 15 months after the effective date of this AD, or the next seat removal, whichever occurs first, verify the
proper configuration and functioning of the passenger oxygen system in accordance with PTC Aerospace Service Bulletin
No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Remove the seat bottom cushion and open the oxygen housing assembly door, Part Number (P/N) 91626, to expose the
oxygen canister and lower firing system. On the Model 950 seats, remove fastening screws of the center console, P/N
98154, and rotate the console forward in addition to removing the cushion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Install an oxygen canister safety cap, Tri-Star P/N CD3, or Scott P/N 36425, to prevent discharging of the oxygen
canister. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Remove the cable release assembly, P/N 91601. Verify that the assembly is the correct length (10.25 inches plus
or minus .25 inch), that the release pin, P/N 91587&hyph;1, is free of burrs and notches, and that the nylon cord is not
worn and is free of any burn damage. If any discrepancies are found, replace with a serviceable unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Verify installation of the correct pin release bracket, P/N 91602&hyph;1. A correct bracket has its plastic grommet
located vertically above the oxygen canister release sleeve. If the bracket is found to be misaligned, replace it
with a correct bracket. Replace the white plastic grommet with a new black plastic grommet, P/N 122326, securing it
with Devo 44044 cyanoacrylate adhesive or equivalent. The grommet is correctly positioned when the grommet slot
is aligned with the pin release bracket slot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Reassemble the cable release assembly with the safety cap on the oxygen canister. Adjust and tighten the jam nuts,
P/N H12292, to obtain a gap between the cable actuating lever, P/N 91599&hyph;1 or ^2, and cable actuating lever stop,
P/N 87310&hyph;3, within .03 inch and .25 inch. Verify that the nylon cord will not contact the oxygen canister in the
assembled configuration and that the cable release pin will release from the oxygen canister with a tension of one
pound or less. If any discrepancies are found, replace the cable release assembly with a serviceable unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Remove the oxygen masks from the seat back housing. Compress the actuator assembly spring, P/N H13341, and install
a bushing, P/N 121836&hyph;1, oriented so that the spring seats in the bushing's counterbore. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Reassemble the oxygen system components with the safety cap on the oxygen canister. Verify that the oxygen system
functions properly by verifying that the lanyard assembly release pin, P/N 91587&hyph;1, releases from the oxygen
canister when the masks are pulled from the seat back housing. If any discrepancies are found, replace the oxygen system
with a serviceable unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded
through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager,
Boston Aircraft Certification Office.

On August 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending
the Sheridan, Wyoming, Class E airspace designation (59 FR 43311). Interested parties were invited to participate
in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During an airspace review an error was discovered in the airspace description for Class E airspace at Sheridan, Wyoming.
This action corrects that error. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class
E airspace is published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994,
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be
published subsequently in the Order.

This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Sheridan, Wyoming. The FAA has
determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a regulatory evaluation as the anicipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entites under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing an order on rehearing of its order which removed
from the Commission's regulations certain natural gas regulations related to natural gas producer regulations
that were either obsolete or nonessential in light of the decontrol of wellhead prices. The order on rehearing denies
the requests for rehearing concerning the deletion of the anti-circumvention rule in &sect;270.203(c) of the Commission's
regulations. The Commission finds that, with the decontrol of wellhead pricing, no purpose is any longer served by
this rule.

The issue raised on rehearing is whether the Commission should have eliminated &sect;270.203(c) of the Commission's
regulations. That section included in the definition of first sale all sales by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline,
intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company. Rehearing applicants contend that, as a result, the Commission
has improperly deprived affiliated marketer sales of their status as deregulated first sales under the Wellhead
Decontrol Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2(21) of the NGPA defines a first sale. Sections 2(21) (A) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (B) set forth a general definition
of a first sale that excludes sales of affiliates of inter- and intrastate pipelines and local distribution companies
(LDCs) from the first sale definition unless the affiliate is selling gas it produced. However, section 2(21)(A)(v)
grants the Commission authority to define, as a first sale, any sale that does not qualify under sections 2(21)(A)
(i)&hyph;(iv) ``in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this Act.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1979, in Order No. 58 implementing the NGPA, the Commission exercised its NGPA section 2(21)(A)(v) authority to
define all sales by pipeline affiliates as first sales. That definition was set forth in 18 CFR 270.203(c). Specifically,
&sect;270.203(c) provides that any sale by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or LDC is
a first sale under the NGPA unless the Commission determines not to treat it as such. The Commission explained that
the reason for such treatment of affiliate sales was to prevent circumvention of the NGPA maximum lawful prices because
otherwise an entity could avoid first sale treatment by becoming an affiliate of a pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, although sales by interstate pipeline marketing affiliates generally would not qualify as first sales under
NGPA sections (21) (A) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (B), they came to be defined as first sales by reason of &sect;270.203(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 repealed as of January 1, 1993, the entire Title I of the NGPA which contains
the ceiling prices. However, the Decontrol Act did not remove nor modify NGPA section 2(21), including the authorization
for the Commission to define as first sales those sales that would not otherwise qualify for such status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order No. 567 removed from the Commission's regulations certain natural gas regulations related to natural gas producer
regulation that the Commission considered obsolete or nonessential in light of the decontrol of wellhead prices.
These included the &sect;270.203(c) definition of a first sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On rehearing of Order No. 567, the petitioners urge the Commission to retroactively reinstate &sect;270.203(c).
They argue that the removal of &sect;270.203(c) adversely affects marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines
by placing them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-regulated non-affiliated marketers. They assert
that the removal of the regulation means that affiliated marketer sales will no longer qualify as deregulated first
sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act and that they will become subject to Natural Gas Act (NGA) price and non-price
regulation. They contend that the blanket marketer certificates that would apply under the NGA are not equivalent
to deregulation and are always subject to change or termination by the Commission. They assert that treatment as non-regulated
first sales is essential to continue fair competition among affiliated and non-affiliated marketers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the parties contend that the Commission has failed to satisfy the requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA) by removing &sect;270.203(c) without public notice or opportunity to comment.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed below, the Commission denies rehearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. First Sale Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Order No. 567 deleted &sect;270.203(c) from the Commission's regulations as part of the removal of a number of regulations
that were rendered obsolete or nonessential by the Wellhead Decontrol Act. The Commission continues to believe that
the deletion of &sect;270.203(c) was appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wellhead Decontrol Act has eliminated all maximum lawful prices applicable to first sales. As a result, no purpose
is any longer served by our exercising our authority under NGPA section 2(21)(A)(v) to define additional categories
of sales as first sales ``in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this Act.''
Circumvention cannot be a concern when there are no maximum lawful prices to circumvent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that, as a result of the Wellhead Decontrol Act and our subsequent deletion of &sect;270.203(c),
interstate pipeline marketing affiliates' sales are no longer first sales. However, this fact does not create a competitive
disadvantage for marketing affiliates as alleged. In Order No. 547, the Commission issued blanket certificates
under section 7 of the NGA to all persons making sales of gas for resale in interstate commerce who are not interstate
pipelines. Certain additional conditions were attached to the blanket certificates issued to interstate pipeline
marketing affiliates to preclude potential discriminatory practices. Those blanket certificates place all marketers
on an equal competitive footing by effectively eliminating the distinctions in treatment that formerly existed
between regulated and non-regulated marketers. An interstate pipeline affiliated marketer may make sales under
its blanket certificate at negotiated rates with pregranted abandonment to compete with unregulated marketers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, at this time, there is no practical difference between treatment as marketing affiliates under the blanket
marketer sales certificates issued in Order No. 547 and treatment as first sales. Petitioners' concern appears to
be more that regulation under the blanket certificates might change in the future, rather than any concern with how
this system of light-handed regulation operates at the present time. For example, Texaco Gas Marketing Inc. states
in its request for rehearing, ``The blanket sales certificate regulations prevent the removal of Section 2[70].203(c)
from having any present effect, but if the blanket certificate is modified or repealed, non-affiliated marketers
and affiliated marketers may not be competing on a level playing field.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 But, our July 28, 1994 order did nothing to affect the terms of the blanket marketer certificates issued by Order No.
547 and, therefore, the rights of the parties have not been affected, and thus no party has been aggrieved by our order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Moreover, the Commission continues to believe that the existing blanket marketer certificates are appropriate,
considering the competitive wellhead market and the changes in the industry due to restructuring under Order No.
636 and decontrol under the Wellhead Decontrol Act. Thus, no changes to those certificates are contemplated.

to be considered aggrieved a party must demonstrate a ``present and immediate'' injury in fact, or ``at least *&blank;*&blank;*
a looming unavoidable threat'' of injury. The alleged injury must be ``concrete, perceptible harm of a real, non-speculative
nature.'') If the Commission were to alter the blanket certificates in the future, the Commission would reexamine
the treatment of affiliate sales at that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The parties requesting rehearing rely on a statement in the March 12, 1993 order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on rehearing of Order No. 547, which was issued after wellhead decontrol took effect, as supporting their position
that affiliated marketer sales should continue to be treated as first sales even after wellhead decontrol. In that
order, the Commission interpreted section 201 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 as providing that all importations
of natural gas and LNG, that are subject to a free trade agreement, are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, since
they are deregulated first sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act. In clarifying that inter-affiliate importations
are first sales eligible for the exemption from Commission jurisdiction granted by section 201 of the Energy Policy
Act, the Commission relied in part on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;270.203(c). The Commission stated that, while its interpretation in &sect;270.203(c) ``stemmed, in part,
from a concern about affiliates' ability to circumvent the then existing maximum lawful prices under Title I of the
NGPA *&blank;*&blank;* the Commission has continued to adhere to its interpretation of the statute even as the categories
of maximum lawful prices waned pursuant to the NGPA.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, the Commission finding in that order was for the narrow purpose of interpreting section 201 of the Energy
Policy Act regarding the importation of natural gas and LNG that is subject to a free trade agreement. Moreover, Congress
itself, in that section, intended to define all such importations as NGPA first sales. Thus it appears the Commission's
reliance on the &sect;270.203(c) definition was unnecessary to the results reached in that order.

without notice and comment. Under section 553(b)(B) of the APA, an agency is not required to issue a notice of proposed

In the July 28, 1994 final rule, the Commission merely updated its regulations to remove regulations rendered obsolete
by the Wellhead Decontrol Act. Ordinarily the Commission may update its regulations in that manner without notice
and comment, and it has done so in the past.

 And in this case, the appropriateness of the removal of the regulations other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;270.203(c) without notice is undisputed. However, in retrospect, the Commission recognizes that it might
have been better to provide public notice and an opportunity to comment before the removal of &sect;270.203(c). However,
in the particular circumstances of this case, the Commission does not believe that any party has been significantly
harmed.

First, the issue here is a relatively narrow one of whether the anti-circumvention rule adopted in &sect;270.203(c)
should be eliminated, in light of the fact that the Wellhead Decontrol Act has removed the maximum lawful prices whose
circumvention &sect;270.203(c) was designed to prevent. While the parties had no opportunity to comment on that
issue before Order No. 567 was issued, the parties have now had such an opportunity in their requests for rehearing.
Eight parties have taken advantage of the opportunity to comment on rehearing, and discussed the issue in detail.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Of course an opportunity to comment on rehearing does not cure the lack of prior notice in all cases. Here, however,
given the relatively narrow issue involved, it does not appear that providing any further opportunity to comment,
at this stage, would serve any useful purpose.

This is particularly so, since, at present, there is no practical difference in treatment between operating under
the blanket marketer sales certificates and treatment as a non-regulated first seller. Therefore, the rulemaking
has had no substantive impact on the rights of the parties. Moreover, the blanket certificate having been issued by
rule, any change in that certificate would entail a new rulemaking proceeding in which parties would have a full opportunity
for notice and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 the Federal Energy Administration found that an emergency existed and the court found that the threat to the public
would be sufficiently dire for good cause to be found to not provide notice and comment. But the APA does not require
an emergency, and provides an exception where there is no substantive effect, as in

 The only issue was whether the notice and opportunity to comment that was provided was sufficient to give the public
fair notice of the final form of the rule. Here, in the particular circumstances of this case, the rehearing requests
have provided a sufficient opportunity. In

 Today's action announces a partial 3-month stay and reconsideration of certain national emission standards for
hazardous air pollutants for certain sources. The effectiveness of provisions of the ``National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic
Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks''
59 FR 19402 (April 22, 1994) and 59 FR 29196 (June 6, 1994) (collectively known as the ``hazardous organic NESHAP''
or the ``HON''), for compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers is stayed for 3 months pending
reconsideration. The EPA is issuing this stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B),
which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the EPA promulgated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (``NESHAP'') for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing
industry (``SOCMI''), and for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks portion of the rule. These regulations
were promulgated as subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly referred to as the HON. Subpart H establishes
standards for equipment leaks, including standards for compressors (40 CFR 63.164) and for surge control vessels
and bottoms receivers (40 CFR 63.170). The final rule required existing sources to comply with subpart H beginning
October 24, 1994, for some groups of SOCMI processes and for processes subject to subpart I (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(i) and 63.190(e)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A petition for reconsideration has been submitted to the EPA requesting the HON be revised in order for sources to have
additional time to comply with the equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels
and bottoms receivers. The petition contains new information demonstrating that compliance by October 24, 1994,
with the standards applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, is not possible
because at many facilities major equipment modifications or replacements are necessary in order to comply with the
standards. This new information, which the EPA did not have prior to the promulgation of the HON, is described more
fully in the notice contained in the Proposed Rules section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that proposes to defer compliance with the equipment leak provisions of the HON that are applicable to compressors
and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. For these reasons, the EPA is staying the effectiveness of the
provisions of the HON applicable to leaks from compressors and from surge control vessels and bottoms receivers for
3 months in order to respond to the petition for reconsideration and revise the rule as necessary to resolve this issue.

40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(ii) through (k)(3)(v). In the proposal contained in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, EPA is proposing a compliance extension for the sources required to comply as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 23, 1995, or later, as well as the sources required to comply as of October 24, 1994. Accordingly, today's stay
does not affect all sources with compressors or surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Issuance of Stay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA hereby issues a 3-month administrative stay of the effectiveness of the HON equipment leak provisions applicable
to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers for sources required to comply beginning on October
24, 1994. The EPA will reconsider the compliance dates in the rule and, following the notice and comment procedures
of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take appropriate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Authority for Stay and Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative stay and reconsideration announced by this notice are being undertaken pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B)
of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B). That provision authorizes the Administrator to stay the effectiveness
of a rule for up to 3 months in order to consider a request for reconsideration. Reconsideration is appropriate if the
grounds for an objection arose after the period for public comment and if the objection is of central relevance to the
outcome of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grounds for reconsideration of this rule arose after the public comment period. The problems attendant to requiring
compliance with the equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers only became apparent after the close of comment on the rule. Therefore, the EPA is staying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the rule for 3 months in order to allow time to reconsider this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Proposed Compliance Extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA may not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rule
stayed by this notice within the 3-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). If the EPA does not complete
the reconsideration in this timeframe, then it will be necessary to temporarily extend the applicable compliance
dates. In the Proposed Rule Section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA proposes a temporary extension of the compliance dates beyond 3 months if necessary in order to complete reconsideration
and revision of the rules in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small business entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), that are suspended on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance
with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of
that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt
and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is
published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their
eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage
unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) establishes new regulations to require regulatory
authorities to use OSM's Applicant/Violator Computer System (AVS) and other information sources to identify ownership
or control links between permit applicants and violators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations establish the procedures, standards, and type of proof required to challenge ownership or control
links and to disprove violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM also amends a number of regulations affecting blocking of permits, abatement of notices of violation, improvidently
issued permits, and permit application information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations reduce the possibility of violators receiving and retaining permits in violation of the permit approval
provisions of SMCRA. Finally, the rules establish enhanced due process procedures for the regulated community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 510(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act) and 30 CFR part 773 establish
certain requirements for permits and permit processing. These requirements include the identification of ownership
or control links between permit applicants and individuals or entities who are responsible for unabated violations
of certain Federal or State laws and rules. See 30 CFR 773.5; 30 CFR 773.15(b). The purpose of such inquiry is to determine
whether a permit applicant is linked to unabated violations of the Act and related air and water quality requirements.
See 30 CFR 773.15(b). In the event that a permit applicant is so linked, the regulatory authority may not issue a permit
to the applicant unless the applicant submits proof that the violation has been or is in the process of being corrected
to the satisfaction of the agency that has jurisdiction over the violation. In the alternative, the applicant may
establish that the violation is the subject of a good faith, direct, administrative or judicial appeal which contests
the validity of the violation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event that a permit applicant is so linked and proof of the violation's correction or good faith appeal is not
submitted, issuance of a permit to the applicant may constitute improvident issuance and may subject the permittee
to certain remedial measures including suspension or rescission of the permit. See 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C. January 31, 1985) (Parker, J.), the Secretary of the Interior was required to improve the
enforcement and implementation of Section 510(c) of SMCRA, and to establish a computerized Applicant/Violator
System (``AVS'') to match permit applicants and their owners and controllers with current violators of SMCRA. OSM
has developed such a computer system to enable OSM and State regulatory authorities to comply effectively with the
responsibilities prescribed by Section 510(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR part 773.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 24, 1990, OSM and DOI entered into a Settlement Agreement attempting to resolve litigation with Save Our
Cumberland Mountains (``SOCM'') and other plaintiffs. The Settlement Agreement was approved by the U.S. District
Court on September 5, 1990, and became effective, by its own terms, on that date. See Memorandum of the Court,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C. September 5, 1990). That Settlement Agreement contained provisions whereby OSM agreed
to propose rules to implement Section 510(c) of SMCRA and the AVS. Accordingly, on September 6, 1991, OSM proposed
rules whose purpose was:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
to require that, prior to issuing permits to applicants, regulatory authorities consider complete ownership and
control information in conducting the analysis mandated by section 510(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(b). The proposed
rules would mandate the use of AVS as a critical component of the ownership and control information consideration
process.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
See Proposed Rule, Use of the Applicant/Violator Computer System in Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval,
56 FR 45780, 45781 (September 6, 1991). While the proposal of the rules fulfilled certain provisions of OSM's Settlement
Agreement with SOCM, OSM indicated that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
it must be emphasized that OSM independently believes that the proposal and public consideration of such rules are
important to assist OSM in implementing its duties under Section 510(c) of SMCRA and duties imposed by regulations
such as 30 CFR 773.15. The proposed rules should be viewed as proposals that OSM would have made regardless of any litigation
or settlement.

Subsequently, on March 16, 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals (D.C. Cir.) vacated the District Court's approval of the
Settlement Agreement with SOCM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 90&hyph;5374, Slip. Op. (U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Cir., May 22, 1992). In its decision, the Court noted that
``nothing'' in the Court's opinion precluded OSM's maintenance and improvement of the AVS as agency policy.

As OSM indicated at the time of its proposal of September 1991, these rules are important and appropriate_independent
of any litigation or settlement. OSM continues to be committed to the maintenance and improvement of the AVS as a matter
of agency policy and believes that the publication of final rules is now necessary to the effective implementation
of section 510(c) of the Act and the implementation of the AVS. OSM's commitment to AVS is in accord with the position
recently expressed by the Senate Appropriations Committee:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the AVS, the Committee joins the House in commending OSM for improvements made to the system. The Committee
has consistently supported development and implementation of the AVS because the AVS is essential to effective enforcement
of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA].

Report of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Report No. 103&hyph;114, at page 47 (July 28, 1993). Accordingly,
OSM has determined to go forward with the final rules published today without regard to the course of litigation between
OSM and SOCM or any other person. OSM has reviewed the proposed rules in light of the comments that have been made with
a view towards serving the agency's commitment to protecting the environment, to implementing SMCRA, and ultimately,
to serving the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final rules incorporate the AVS into the Federal regulations and mandate the use of the system by State and Federal
surface mining regulatory authorities. At the same time that these rules strengthen the enforcement of Section 510(c),
they also establish a detailed set of procedural pathways to assure the protection of due process for the regulated
community.

As indicated above, OSM published proposed rules on September 6, 1991. The proposed regulations were available for
public comment until November 20, 1991. Comments were received from members of the regulated community, representatives
of environmental advocacy groups, representatives of State regulatory authorities, and various citizens. While
a total of 20 commenters submitted written comments, most comments can be grouped into three major categories which
are captioned below. After the discussion of these three major issues, this preamble will then provide a section-by-section
discussion of the final rules.

The Table of Contents is amended to include new section numbers 773.22, verification of ownership or control application
information; 773.23, review of ownership or control and violation information; 773.24, procedures for challenging
ownership or control links shown in AVS; and 773.25, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the
status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.5 is amended to include definitions of ``Applicant/Violator System'' or ``AVS.'' The terms are defined
to mean the computer system maintained by OSM to identify ownership or control links involving permit applicants,
permittees, and persons cited in violation notices. The regulation is further amended to include definitions of
``Federal violation notice,'' ``Ownership or control link,'' ``State violation notice,'' and ``Violation notice.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``Federal violation notice'' is defined to include a violation notice issued by OSM or by another agency or instrumentality
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ``ownership or control link'' is defined as any relationship included in the definition of ``owned or controlled''
or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 or in the violations review provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). It includes any relationship
presumed to constitute ownership or control under 30 CFR 773.5(b) unless such presumption has been successfully
rebutted under sections 773.24 and 773.25 of this rule or under the provisions of 30 CFR part 775 and &sect;773.25 of
this rule. It also includes an identity between persons, e.g., an applicant and a violator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``State violation notice'' is defined as a violation notice issued by a State regulatory authority or by another
agency or instrumentality of State government.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Violation notice'' is defined as any written notification from any governmental entity advising of violations
of the Act or any other laws which would form the basis for a regulatory authority to deny issuance of a permit in accordance
with the criteria contained in &sect;773.15(b) of the regulations. The type of written notification is broadly defined
to include a letter, memorandum, legal or administrative pleading, or other written communication. Consistent
with the provisions of &sect;773.15(b), the term includes notification of a violation of the Act, any Federal rule
or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, a State program, or any Federal or State law, rule, or regulation pertaining
to air or water environmental protection in connection with a surface coal mining operation. It includes, but is not
limited to, a notice of violation; an imminent harm cessation order; a failure-to-abate cessation order; a final
order, bill, or demand letter pertaining to a delinquent civil penalty; a bill or demand letter pertaining to delinquent
abandoned mine reclamation fees; and a notice of bond forfeiture, where one or more violations upon which the forfeiture
was based have not been corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.10 is revised to include the new sections of the AVS-related rules that result in information collection
requirements. The revision provides an estimate of the average public reporting burden of four and one-half hours
per response for the collection of information under part 773 as such part is revised by these final rules. The section
also lists the addresses for OSM and OMB where comments on the information collection requirements may be sent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 773.15(b)(1) is amended to require the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information
concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant. Such information would include
that obtained pursuant to &sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information); &sect;773.23
(review of ownership or control and violation information); &sect;778.13 (identification of interests); and &sect;778.14
(violation information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net effect of referencing such provisions in &sect;773.15(b)(1) is to assure that the regulatory authority makes
a decision with respect to permit issuance or denial based upon complete information relating to ownership, control,
and violations. Such complete information includes the mandated use of AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, in accordance with &sect;773.23, the regulatory authority will follow the procedures and standards
set forth in &sect;&sect;773.24 and 773.25 in deciding whether to issue the permit under &sect;773.15(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has also decided to amend 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to provide that, in the absence of a failure-to-abate cessation order
(FTACO), a regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation (NOV) is being corrected to the satisfaction
of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation where the abatement period for such notice of violation has not
yet expired and where the permit applicant has provided certification in his or her permit application that such violation
is in the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. In addition,
OSM has also amended 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) to provide that any permits issued incident to such presumption and certification
will be conditionally issued based upon successful completion of the necessary abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.20 is amended by the insertion of a new paragraph (b)(2), which makes the provisions of proposed &sect;773.25,
standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, applicable when a regulatory
authority makes determinations with respect to improvidently issued permits. In this context, &sect;773.25 is
applicable when a regulatory authority determines whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time that it
was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject
of a good faith appeal, and whether any ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible
for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The insertion of the language referring to &sect;773.25 has the effect of assuring that the standards, responsibilities,
and procedures created by proposed &sect;773.25 are consistently applied to permit issuance and to determinations
regarding improvident permit issuance. Such an approach enhances the fairness of the permitting process and the
prospect for the uniform enforcement of nationwide minimum standards. In one respect, however, the improvident
permit issuance process will differ from the permit issuance process. In the improvident permit issuance process,
prior to permit suspension or rescission, the permittee will be able to challenge the existence of the violation at
the time it was cited. In the permit issuance process, prior to permit denial, the applicant will not be able to challenge
the existence of the violation at the time it was cited.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM has also renumbered certain provisions of the regulation at 30 CFR 773.20(c). Among such provisions, renumbered
paragraph (c)(1)(iv), which authorizes the regulatory authority to use rescission as one of the remedial measures
for improvident permit issuance, deletes a specific reference contained in the former 30 CFR 773.20(c)(4) to the
rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for this deletion is that OSM today establishes a prior notice and a common appeal procedure for both permit
suspensions and permit rescissions with respect to improvidently issued permits. The former regulation governing
permit suspensions at 30 CFR 773.20(c)(3) did not impose any specific requirements for prior notice, opportunity
to be heard, or right of appeal for the permittee whose permit is to be suspended. See 54 FR 18450 (1989). In contrast
to this, regulations governing permit rescissions at 30 CFR 773.21 contained specific requirements for prior notice
to a permittee and an explicit right of appeal. OSM has now provided for greater consistency in its procedures governing
suspension and rescission of permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSM amends 30 CFR 773.20 to add a new paragraph (c)(2) which requires that a regulatory authority which
decides to suspend a permit must provide at least 30 days' prior written notice to the permittee. In the event that the
regulatory authority decides to rescind a permit, it must provide notice in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR
773.21. The amendment further provides that a permittee be given the opportunity to request administrative review
of the notice under Office of Hearings and Appeals, (OHA) rule 43 CFR 4.1370 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, where OSM is the regulatory authority, or under the State program equivalent, where the State is the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation further allows for enhanced due process protection and fairness by providing that temporary relief
from the regulatory authority's decision is available in accordance with the provisions of OHA rule 43 CFR 4.1376
or the State program equivalent. In the absence of such temporary relief, the regulatory authority's decision remains
in effect during the pendency of appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has retained the language in paragraph 773.20 which addresses the situation which occurs when a permit is issued
in reliance upon the presumption that an NOV is being abated in the absence of a cessation order and a cessation order
is, in fact, issued with respect to the violation. In such an event, a regulatory authority is required to find that
the permit has been improvidently issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM amends paragraph (a) of 30 CFR 773.21 to make the provisions of &sect;773.25, standards for challenging ownership
or control links and the status of violations, applicable when a regulatory authority invokes the automatic suspension
and rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. The rationale for such amendment is the same as that discussed above with
respect to similar language contained in &sect;773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM deletes former paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 773.21 which provides for appeals of rescission notices. As discussed
above, rescission appeal procedures are incorporated in 30 CFR 773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.22 is a new section and mandates an inquiry whose focus is to assure that the regulatory authority develops
complete and accurate information as to the identification of the applicant and all owners or controllers of the applicant
prior to making a determination on a permit application and enters such information promptly into the AVS. Accordingly,
this section focuses on verification of ownership or control application information. Such accurate and complete
information enables the regulatory authority to make an informed decision as to whether the applicant is linked to
a surface coal mining and reclamation operation in violation of the Act or other any other environmental law within
the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;773.22 imposes a duty upon a regulatory authority to review the information provided in the
permit application, pursuant to 30 CFR 778.13(c) and 778.13(d), to determine whether the information provided,
including the identification of the operator and all owners and controllers of the operator, is complete and accurate.
In making such determination, the regulatory authority is required to compare information provided in the application
with information contained in manual and automated data sources. Manual sources for review include the regulatory
authority's own enforcement and inspection records and State corporation commission or tax records, to the extent
they contain information concerning ownership or control links. Automated data sources include the regulatory
authority's own computer systems, if any, and the AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.22 provides that, if it appears from information provided in the application pursuant
to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;778.13 that none of the persons identified in the application has had any previous
mining experience, the regulatory authority has to inquire of the applicant and investigate whether anyone other
than those persons identified in the application will own or control the mining operation as either an operator or
as another type of owner or controller.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.22 provides that if, after conducting the information review described above, the regulatory
authority identifies any potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency in the ownership or control information
provided in the application, it must contact the applicant prior to making a final determination with respect to the
application. The applicant is then required to resolve the potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency through
submission of an amendment to the application or a satisfactory explanation which includes credible information
sufficient to demonstrate that no actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency exists. The regulation also contains
a reference to required action by the regulatory authority in accordance with &sect;843.23, sanctions for knowing
omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information, or the State program equivalent, where
appropriate. As will be described more fully below, OSM is deferring action at this time with respect to proposed &sect;843.23.
Such proposed section will be considered as part of a subsequent rulemaking. OSM has, however, retained the reference
to proposed &sect;843.23 in final &sect;773.22 in the event that proposed &sect;843.23 is ultimately adopted. Nevertheless,
OSM has made no decision with respect to the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 and the retention of such reference
does not mean that OSM will ultimately adopt proposed &sect;843.23 as a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;773.22 requires that, upon completion of the information review mandated by &sect;773.22,
the regulatory authority promptly enter into or update all ownership or control information on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.23 is a new section which delineates the regulatory authority's review obligations with respect to a
permit application after the regulatory authority has completed the process of verifying ownership or control application
information as described in proposed &sect;773.22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;773.23 requires the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information
concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant to determine whether the application
can be approved under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). With respect to ownership or control links involving the
applicant, such information includes all information obtained under proposed &sect;773.22 and 30 CFR 778.13. With
respect to violation notices, such information includes all information obtained under &sect;778.14, information
obtained from OSM, including information shown in the AVS, and information obtained from the regulatory authority's
own records concerning violation notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, the regulation assures that the regulatory authority considers complete ownership, control, and
violation information in making the decision required by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) with respect to a permit application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.23 provides the course of action which a regulatory authority is required to take if the
review conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of the section discloses any ownership or control link between the applicant
and any person cited in a violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;773.23 requires that the regulatory authority notify the applicant of such link
and refer the applicant to the agency with jurisdiction over the violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;773.23 requires that the regulatory authority not approve the permit application unless
and until it determines that all ownership or control links between the applicant and any person cited in a violation
notice are erroneous or have been rebutted, or the regulatory authority determines that the violation to which the
applicant has been linked has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith
appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) or the State program equivalent. The determinations to be made by
the regulatory authority under paragraph (b)(2) of the regulation are made in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.24,
procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS, and &sect;773.25, standards for challenging
ownership or control links and the status of violations, or their State program equivalents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.23 requires that, following the regulatory authority's decision on the application
or following the applicant's withdrawal of the application, the regulatory authority is required to promptly enter
all relevant information related to the decision or withdrawal into AVS. The regulatory authority's decision could
include unconditional issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of the permit. The requirement that all relevant
information be promptly entered into AVS is intended to insure that AVS is continually updated to reflect the most
current information available with respect to permit applicants. A critical source of such information is the regulatory
authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.24 is a new section that establishes the procedures to be followed if a person wishes to challenge an ownership
or control link between a person and any other person shown on AVS. The procedures to be followed by both OSM and the challenger
are included. The section provides procedures for direct appeals of such links to OSM by persons who have been so linked.
The section also provides for challenges concerning the status of violations to which persons shown on AVS have been
linked. The section further provides the opportunity for those persons making a challenge to obtain a temporary relief
from any adverse use of the challenged link or violation information during the pendency of such challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS is an ownership or control
link to any person could challenge such a link in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of &sect;773.24
and in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.25. Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides, however, that
such challenge is not available if the challenger is bound by a prior administrative or judicial decision with respect
to the link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that challenges of ownership or control links shown on AVS are made before
OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;773.24 provides that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS in an ownership or control
link to a person cited in a Federal violation notice seeking to challenge the status of such violation may do so in accordance
with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.25,
which are discussed in detail below. The procedures applicable are similar to those described in paragraph (a)(1)
of &sect;773.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``status of the violation'' means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been corrected, is in the process
of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal to contest the validity
of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i)&hyph;(ii). This usage is carried forward into paragraphs (b) and (c)
of &sect;773.24 and into the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of &sect;773.25. The process for challenging the
status of a Federal violation is a Federal process and such challenges will be made before OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In challenging the current status of a violation under &sect;773.24 or 773.25, a person will not be able to challenge
the existence of the violation at the time it was cited unless the challenge is made by a permittee within the context
of the improvidently issued permit process or by an applicant after permit denial. In general, the existence of the
violation will have been established by prior administrative or judicial proceedings involving the person cited
in the violation notice, or by such person's failure to exhaust its available remedies in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;773.24 provides, in language similar to that contained in paragraph (a)(1) of the regulation,
that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation is not available to any person who ``is bound by a prior administrative
or judicial determination concerning the status of the violation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;773.24 provides that any applicant or person shown in AVS to be linked by ownership or control
to a person cited in a State violation notice may challenge the status of the violation before the State that issued
the violation notice. The challenge must be made in accordance with the State's program equivalents to paragraphs
(b) through (d) of &sect;773.24 and &sect;773.25. Again, the challenge may not involve the existence of the violation
at the time it was cited, and is not available if the challenger is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination
with respect to status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.24 requires that any applicant or other person seeking to challenge ownership or control
links shown in AVS or the status of Federal violations must submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or
her challenge and provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. The information must be submitted
to the Chief of OSM's AVS Office in Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.24 provides that, in response to a challenge made under paragraph (b) of that section,
OSM must make a written decision with respect to the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the
violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that, if OSM has determined that the ownership or control link has been
shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted and/or that the violation covered by the violation notice has been corrected,
is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, OSM is required to provide notice of its
determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation. If an application
is pending, OSM must also notify the regulatory authority before whom the application is pending. Further, OSM is
required to correct information contained in AVS to reflect the determination which has been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) of &sect;773.24 provides that, if OSM has determined that the challenged ownership or control link
has not been shown to be erroneous and has not been rebutted, and that the violation remains outstanding, OSM must provide
notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation.
If an application is pending, OSM must also notify the regulatory authority before whom the application is pending.
Further, OSM is required to update information contained in AVS, if necessary, to reflect OSM's determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of &sect;773.24 provides that OSM must serve a copy of its decision with respect to a challenge
upon the applicant or other challenger by certified mail, or by any other means consistent with the rules governing
service of a summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The regulation provides that
service is complete upon tender of the notice or of the mail and is not deemed incomplete by virtue of a challenger's
refusal to accept the notice or mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.24 provides that the applicant or other challenger can appeal OSM's decision
to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within 30 days of such decision in accordance
with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) further provides that OSM's decision remains in effect unless temporary relief was granted
in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. The filing of an appeal will not automatically suspend the use
of the information in AVS during the pendency of such appeal. The challenger must explicitly seek such relief in appeal
proceeding before OHA.

Section 773.25 is a new section which establishes standards for challenges to ownership or control links and for challenges
to the status of violations. The section allocates responsibilities between OSM and State regulatory authorities
for resolving issues related to ownership and control and provides the standards for evidence to resolve such issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;773.25 provides that provisions of &sect;773.25 are applicable to any challenge concerning
an ownership or control link to any person or the status of any violation covered by a violation notice when such challenge
is made under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); &sect;&sect;773.23
(the regulatory authority's review of ownership or control and violation information), and 773.24 (procedures
for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS); or 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of
permitting decisions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.25 provides the basic allocation of responsibility among regulatory authorities to
make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending

Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice, whether
State or Federal, has responsibility for making decisions concerning the status of the violation covered by the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``status'' of the violation means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been corrected, is in the process
of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of &sect;773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS, the responsibilities

authority of OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of &sect;773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS relating to the status
of a violation and with respect to ownership or control information which has not been entered into AVS by a State, the
authority of a State regulatory authority is subject to OSM's oversight authority under 30 CFR parts 773, 842, and
843.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.25 establishes evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and informal review of
ownership or control links and the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;773.25 provides that in any formal or informal review of an ownership or control link or
of the status of a violation covered by a violation notice, the agency responsible for making a decision is required
to first make a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists, existed during the relevant period, and/or
that the violation remains outstanding. A prima facie determination is made when the agency is reviewing the evidence
itself, in an informal process; a prima facie showing is made when the agency's determination is the subject of a formal
administrative or judicial review process. When the agency makes such a determination or showing, the person seeking
to challenge the link or the status of the violation then has the burden of proving the necessary elements of his or her
challenge to the link or to the status of the violation by a preponderance of the evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c) of &sect;773.25, a challenger of a link has to prove at least one of three proposed conclusions
by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of &sect;773.25, a challenger could prove that the facts relied upon by the responsible
agency to establish ownership or control under the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls''
in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist or that the facts relied upon to establish a presumption of ownership or control
under the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of &sect;773.25 provides that a person subject to a presumption of ownership or control under
the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 could rebut such presumption by demonstrating
that he or she does not or did not in fact have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface
coal mining operations are or were conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of &sect;773.25 provides that a challenger could prove that the violation covered by a violation
notice did not exist, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal
within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) further provides, however, that a person challenging
the status of a violation would not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited under
the provisions of &sect;773.24 unless such challenger is a permittee acting within the context of &sect;&sect;773.20&hyph;773.21
of this part. In any circumstance, a person who had failed to take timely advantage of a prior opportunity to challenge
the violation notice or who was bound by a previous administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence
of the violation would also be precluded from making a challenge to the existence of the violation at the time it was
cited in any proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) of &sect;773.25 describes the type of evidence that a person challenging an ownership or control
link or the status of a violation has to present to meet the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The regulation
provides that the evidence presented be probative, reliable, and substantial. See 5 U.S.C. 556(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) of &sect;773.25 provides a list of examples of such evidence for proceedings before the ``responsible
agency'' (the agency with responsibility for making a decision with respect to a challenge) and for proceedings before
administrative or judicial tribunals reviewing the decisions of the responsible agency. The list of the types of
acceptable evidence is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. It is expected that regulatory authorities
will add to this list as they develop experience in making determinations under the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of &sect;773.25 focuses upon proceedings before the responsible agency. The list of examples
includes documents which are likely to be truthful and which have certain indicators of reliability which go beyond
the mere assertions of the individual presenting the evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of the section provides that a challenger may submit affidavits setting forth specific facts
concerning the scope of responsibility of the various owners or controllers of an applicant, a permittee, or any person
cited in a violation notice; the duties actually performed by such owners or controllers; the beginning and ending
dates of such owners' or controllers' affiliation with the applicant, permittee, or person cited in a violation notice;
and the nature and details of any transaction creating or serving an ownership or control link; or specific facts concerning
the status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of section 773.25 each look to official certification as the basis for
the reliability of a submitted document. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) allows for the submission of copies of certain types
of documents if they are certified. Such documents include copies of corporate minutes, stock ledgers, contracts,
purchase and sale agreements, leases, correspondence or other relevant company records. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)
allows for submission of certified copies of documents filed with or issued by any State, municipal, or Federal governmental
agency.

Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final &sect;773.25 provides for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in
support of his or her position. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary
materials; when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and
when counsel states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel
states that such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.25 provides that, when the decision of the responsible agency is reviewed by an
administrative or judicial tribunal, the challenger could present any evidence to such tribunal which is admissible
under the rules of the tribunal. Under the regulation, however, the evidence submitted still has to be probative,
credible, and substantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;773.25 provides for the review and revision of information in AVS to reflect determinations
made by regulatory authorities in response to challenges of ownership or control links or the status of violations.
Paragraph (d) provides that, following any determination by a State regulatory authority or other State agency,
or following any decision by an administrative or judicial tribunal reviewing such determination, the State regulatory
authority shall review the information in AVS to determine if the information in AVS is consistent with the determination
or decision. If it is not consistent, the State regulatory authority is required to promptly inform OSM and request
that the AVS information be revised to reflect the determination or decision.

Paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 778.14 is amended to require a permit applicant to disclose ``all violation notices'' received
by the applicant within the preceding three years. In addition, the introductory language of the provision is amended
to require the disclosure of all outstanding violation notices for any surface coal mining operation that is deemed
or presumed to be owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who is deemed or presumed to own or control
the applicant under definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation previously required the applicant to disclose violations of a number of various laws listed in 30 CFR
778.14(c). Use of the amended definition of ``violation notice'' adopted today as part of 30 CFR 773.5 obviates the
need for listing each of these violations in 30 CFR 778.14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation also previously required that the applicant provide only a list of unabated cessation orders and unabated
air and water quality violation notices received prior to the date of the application by any surface coal mining and
reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant.
With respect to this list, the previous regulation did not require that an applicant list notices of violation received
or unpaid penalties or fees incurred by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant or by
any person who owns or controls the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14 is now amended to require an applicant to disclose all outstanding violation notices
received by any surface coal mining operation that is deemed or presumed to own or control the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, OSM has amended paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14 to provide that for each notice of violation issued pursuant
to 30 CFR 843.12 or under a Federal or State program for which the abatement period has not expired, the applicant must
certify that such notice of violation is in the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction
over the violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Former &sect;843.10 is deleted since part 843 did not contain any information collection requirements which require
approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507. The references to &sect;&sect;843.14(c) and
843.16 formerly in &sect;843.10 did not represent information collection requirements. The requirement in &sect;843.14(c)
for OSM to furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority and to any person having an interest
did not require OMB approval because the obligation to provide the information is imposed upon OSM and not upon the
State or upon a member of the public. Section 843.16 merely informs the public of the right to file an application for
review and request a hearing under 43 CFR part 4.

Section 843.24 is a new section which provides standards for OSM's oversight of State permitting decisions with respect
to ownership or control or the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;843.24 establishes the bases which require OSM to take action under the provisions of paragraphs
(b) and (c) of proposed &sect;843.24. Paragraph (a) provides that OSM is required to take action whenever it determines,
through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State has issued a permit without complying
with the State program equivalents of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application
information), 773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures for challenging
ownership or control links shown in AVS), 773.25 (standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status
of violations), and &sect;843.23. As has been explained previously, OSM has deferred action on adopting proposed
&sect;843.23 at this time. The reference, however, to that proposed rule has been placed in &sect;843.24 in the event
that &sect;843.23 is adopted. The use of such reference does not mean, however, that OSM will ultimately adopt proposed
&sect;843.23.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, as a result of determination made under paragraph (a) of &sect;843.24, OSM has reason to believe that the State
has issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20, paragraph (b) of &sect;843.24 requires OSM
to initiate action under 30 CFR 843.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;843.24 provides for remedial actions by OSM against a State which knowingly fails to comply

Numerous comments were made which addressed various issues with respect to the overall rulemaking. While such comments
also invoked particular sections of the proposed rules, these comments asserted several central themes which went
beyond particular sections of the rulemaking even through specific sections of the proposed rulemaking were referenced
as areas of concern by the commenters. Accordingly, OSM has decided to address these central issues in this portion
of the preamble. Within the context of such discussion, particular sections of the proposed and final rules will be
referred to as necessary. Nevertheless, in these responses, OSM focuses upon central issues which appear to be of
overarching concern to the commenters.

Due Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry commenters asserted that the proposed rules violated due process and the underlying principles of the Act.
These commenters further argued that OSM's proposed rules violated due process principles because they did not allow
for a permit conditioned upon the outcome of an appeal of an ownership or control link, upon the challenge of the status
of the violation, or upon the challenge of the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. They also asserted
that because OSM did not allow for de novo challenges of the existence of violations by owners or controllers, the proposed
rules violated due process principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with these commenters' characterizations. The proposed rules and the rules which have been adopted
today provide detailed procedures to assure that those wishing to contest ownership or control links and the status
of violations may do so. Further, the proposed and final rules provide that decisions on these matters are made based
upon credible evidence and fair processes. Those seeking to challenge the existence of violations have the opportunity
to do so, incident to permit denial, in accordance with currently existing rules which predate this rulemaking. See
Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final
Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (``Due Process Provided.'') (October 3, 1988). In addition, today's final rules clarify
that permittees may make such challenges within the context of the improvidently issued permit process. The procedures
provided in today's final rules supplement current rules contained at 30 CFR part 773 to provide more than sufficient
due process to protect the limited property interest a permit applicant has in the expectancy of a permit to engage
in surface coal mining operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM does not believe that principles of due process mandate, as a necessary condition precedent to the denial of a permit
to an owner or controller of a violator, that the agency provide a full, formal, de novo hearing on the merits of an ownership
or control link, the existence of the violation at the time it was cited, and the status of the violation_followed by
an exhaustive appeal on each of these matters to the court of last resort. Instead, the final rules adopted today provide
due process commensurate with the limited interest of a permit applicant_the expectancy of permit issuance. OSM's
position is consistent with the agency's earlier statements relating to the sufficiency of due process and the protection
of property rights provided by the ownership and control rules and the AVS. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface
Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (October
3, 1988).

 on October 3, 1988, and the agency's implementation of AVS and those rules. In the briefs submitted by the Department
of the Interior in those cases, the Department analyzed relevant case law and carefully explained why the due process
criticisms were not well taken. Copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking.
To the extent relevant, OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department in those briefs herein by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM disagrees with the commenters' view that due process requires that conditional permits be made available
during the tendency of the appeal of an ownership or control link as a condition precedent to permit block. The final
rules published today provide ample protection for an owner or controller by providing the opportunity for an owner
or controller to challenge an ownership or control link. Further, the final rules provide for the Department's Office
of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to grant temporary relief from a permit block, where, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the challenger has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the appeal. OHA is contemporaneously publishing
final rules establishing procedures for the granting of temporary relief. Under OSM's final rules published today
and the OHA rules, the likelihood of the erroneous deprivation of a permit due to an erroneous link is minimal. An appellant
with a meritorious claim can get relief. Conditional permits for all appellants, without regard to the merits of their
claims, are unnecessary and unwarranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the final rules published today provide a measure of protection commensurate with the very limited interest
that a permit applicant has in his or her application for a permit. An applicant does not have a right to a permit to mine
coal in the same way that he or she has title to real property or a leasehold interest in a mineral lease. A permit to mine
coal is a privilege granted by the regulatory authority to those who have complied with the requirements of the Act
and the applicable regulatory program, including the provisions of Section 510(c) of the Act and the provisions of
30 CFR part 773. Until an applicant has been found in compliance with the applicable provisions of the program; until
the other provisions governing permit issuance have been satisfied; and until a permit has been issued, the applicant
has, at most, an expectation which may or may not be reasonable, depending upon the circumstances, that he or she will
qualify for permit issuance. Such an expectancy is highly speculative, continent, and limited. Investments based
on an expectancy do not transform the expectancy into a presently vested property right. See generally

In contrast to this, the agency's interest in and responsibility for implementing Section 510(c) of the Act is substantial
and must be balanced against the limited property interest of the permit applicant. OSM's ability to implement the
provisions of Section 510(c) of the Act is critical to the agency's enforcement of the Act. Those provisions of the
Act prevent violators from receiving new permits and, thus, from injuring the environment at new surface coal mining
operations. Those provisions of the Act encourage abatement of violations and deter operators and their owners or
controllers from committing violations. Potential applicants fear permit denial in the future. Therefore, such
applicants are motivated to prevent or abate violations in the present. Thus, OSM has a substantial interest in the
successful, credible implementation of Section 510(c) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If conditional permits were allowed during the pendency of a prolonged appellate process challenging an ownership
or control link, the agency's ability to enforce the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and the ownership and control
rules would be severely compromised. Rather than abate the violations of their owned or controlled operations, it
is possible that some applicants would routinely appeal ownership or control links without regard to the strength
of the link as demonstrated by a full proceeding on the merits. Such applicants would appeal merely for the purpose
of gaining conditional permits. Depending upon how long the appeals process ran, an operator with a conditional permit
could extract a significant portion of the coal in a permitted mine and would have no incentive to abate the violations
of the surface coal mining operation to which he had been linked. The Act does not contemplate such a result; nor does
the Constitution require it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, such a result would provide an unfair competitive advantage to an unscrupulous operator to the detriment
of the interests of the other members of the coal industry, the majority of whom take responsibility for environmental
reclamation and are responsible corporate citizens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, industry commenters have asserted that there is little likelihood of operators making frivolous
or bad faith ownership or control appeals because they have significant investments in their surface coal mining
operations. While OSM recognizes that this is probably true for the majority of operators, including those who have
provided comments on the proposed rules, experience has shown that a small minority of irresponsible operators can
create harm disproportionate to their numbers. In the process, such irresponsible operators do harm not just to OSM's
effective implementation of the Act, but also to the reputation of the industry as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, a marginal operator's significant investment in coal extraction equipment may mask his/her plan to
avoid spending resources on reclamation. Indeed, there could be a serious economic temptation for such an operator
to protect a significant investment by appealing, if such appeal would support the continuation of operations. Accordingly,
OSM considers the extent of an applicant's investment in a surface coal mining operation to be an unreliable indicator
of an applicant's motive in initiating an appeal. Thus, OSM declines to develop a process requiring the evaluation
of operators' good faith based upon their comparative investments in surface coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM does recognize, however, that a permittee has an interest in his permit deserving of a higher level of protection
than that of an applicant with respect to an application. A valid permit represents more than the mere expectancy represented
by an application. A current, valid permit represents legal authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations
in accordance with the terms of such permit. See section 506 of the Act. Further, a permit carries with it the right of
successive renewal. See section 506(d)(1) of the Act; 30 CFR 774.15. Thus, a detailed process governing improvidently
issued permits has been established which recognizes this interest. See 30 CFR 773.20; 773.21. In response to concerns
asserted by industry with respect to due process, OSM has amended the regulations governing improvident permit issuance
to provide that a permittee can challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited as part of the improvidently
issued permit process. See 773.20(b)(2). OSM has done this in recognition of the more substantial interest that a
permit represents in contrast to the limited interest represented by a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters have further asserted that an owner or controller must be afforded the opportunity to challenge
the validity of the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited as a condition precedent to the recommendation
of a denial of a permit application for an owner or controller of the violation. These commenters argued that owners
or controllers may not have had the opportunity to challenge the validity of the violation which forms the basis of
the permit denial at the time it was cited. They argued that only the actual violators were cited at that time and that
the owners or controllers would not have received notice in a timely manner to enable them to challenge the violation
then. They further asserted that a right to contest the merits of a violation after permit denial is not sufficient
to redress the harm caused by permit denial. Rather than face permit denial, they asserted that coal operators will
be forced to pay the disputed fees or to reclaim land. Accordingly, they asserted that they should be allowed to challenge
the violation prior to any permit denial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with those views. The rights of an owner or controller are well protected by the ability to challenge
the link to the violation. If the ownership or control link is not well taken, then the violation is irrelevant as a basis
for permit block. If the link is meritorious, the owner or controller would have been well-positioned to have had knowledge
in fact of the citations, if he or she desired such knowledge, see, e.g., 30 CFR 843.15(d), and to have compelled the
controlled surface coal mining operation to abate the violation or to challenge the violation in a timely manner.
See, e.g., 30 CFR 843.16(a). Accordingly, if an ownership or control link is well taken, the owner or controller has
already had an opportunity to challenge the violation or to abate the violation through the controlled entity. Under
these circumstances, OSM does not believe that an owner or controller is entitled to an additional opportunity to
challenge the existence of a violation before the regulatory authority can deny issuance of a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even so, the final rules promulgated today would not prohibit the challenge of the existence of the violation. Such
a challenge, however, must be made at the time of permit denial, rather than before, by persons who are not bound by prior
administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to the existence of the violation or who have not had a prior opportunity
to challenge the existence of the violation. This is entirely consistent with OSM's position as expressed in the preamble
to the ownership and control rules published in 1988. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation
Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (October 3, 1988).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, within the context of today's final provisions amending the regulations governing improvident permit
issuance, OSM has made explicit that a permittee may challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited.
A permittee may make such challenge if the challenge is not otherwise precluded by a permittee's previous failure
to take advantage of a prior opportunity to challenge or by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning
the existence of the violation. See &sect;&sect;773.20 and 773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the industry commenters questioned whether the ability to challenge a violation after permit denial
is illusory because OSM may attempt to argue that the owner or controller failed to take advantage of a prior opportunity
to challenge the violation at the time that it was issued or that the challenger was bound by a prior administrative
or judicial determination. This is not OSM's intent. Each specific case must be evaluated on its merits. In general,
a challenge would be precluded only when the facts indicate that a potential challenger has already had the opportunity
to challenge and has squandered it, or when the potential challenger is bound by a prior determination. The purpose
of this portion of the proposed rules and the final rules as adopted is to eliminate multiple repetitive opportunities
for challenge for those who have already had a substantive opportunity to challenge, either directly or through a
controlled entity. It is not OSM's intention to assert these defenses to a challenge unless such defenses are supported
by the facts of a particular case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters argued that a State's decision to deny a permit based upon violation information contained in
AVS is also not subject to challenge. OSM disagrees. The existence of the violation at the time it was cited, along with
any other bases for permit denial, may be challenged in a proceeding under 30 CFR part 775, or the equivalent State programs,
subject to the defenses discussed above. To the extent that a regulatory authority has based its permit denial decision
upon violation information contained in AVS, that information would be an integral part of the challenge proceeding.
When administrative and judicial tribunals consider appeals of permit denials, it is probable that evidence related
to violations which form the basis of a permit denial will be relevant to the tribunal. OSM will work with State regulatory
authorities to provide supporting documentation if required for appeals of State permitting decisions. OSM anticipates
that State regulatory authorities will similarly cooperate with OSM and with each other in making such evidence related
to violation information available to administrative and judicial tribunals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters also asserted that the proposed rules, along with the ownership and control rules promulgated
in 1988, deny due process in that they retroactively impose responsibilities for violations upon owners and controllers.
Again, OSM must reject this characterization of the effect of the proposed rules and 1988 ownership and control rules.
OSM must further reject this characterization with respect to the final regulations adopted today. The ownership
and control rules published in 1988, the AVS-related proposed rules published in September, 1991, and the final rules
published today subject the owners or controllers of violations to permit denial for currently outstanding violations,
rather than past, abated violations. This obligation follows the clear mandate of section 510(c) of the Act which
requires the denial of permits when ``any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant is currently
in violation'' of the Act or other laws cited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the presumptions of ownership and control provided by 30 CFR 773.5 and the final rules merely reflect the
reality that owners or controllers have the authority, by reason of their control at the time that the violations are
committed or during any period when the violations remained outstanding, to be aware of violations, to compel their
controlled entities to undertake timely challenges of violations, and to compel their controlled entities to abate
violations of the Act. Under these circumstances, there is no retroactive application of responsibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the clear provisions of section 507(b)(4) of the Act require, in substance, that permit applicants identify
most of those people who are considered owners or controllers for purposes of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15
and 773.5. As OSM observed in the preamble to the ownership and control rules published in 1988:

With the ownership and control rules published in October of 1988 and with these final rules published today, OSM is
simply implementing sections 510(c) and 507(b)(4) of the Act. None of these provisions impose retroactive responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, related to their due process concerns, industry commenters argued that the proposed rules also violate
the Act by not providing conditional permits during the appeal of ownership or control links, the current status of
the violation, or the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. They pointed to the provisions of current
30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) which allow for a permit to be conditioned upon a good faith, direct administrative or judicial
appeal to contest the validity of the current violation as indicative of the agency's longstanding recognition that
such an appeal is consistent with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis and rejects the view that OSM's historic interpretation of the Act requires
that owners or controllers be entitled to permits conditioned upon the appeals of ownership or control links, the
status of the violation, or the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) does not constitute the agency's recognition that all appeals form the basis
for conditional permits. Such a blanket interpretation would negate the clear mandate of the provisions of section
510(c) of the Act and of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which require the denial of permits to applicants who own or control surface
coal mining operations in current violation of the Act. As has been discussed previously in this preamble, the issuance
of permits conditioned upon the appeal of ownership or control links thwarts the effective implementation of section
510(c) of the Act. OSM has never interpreted its regulations to allow for such a result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to commenters' assertions, the regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) only allows a limited exception for good
faith, direct administrative or judicial appeals contesting the validity of the violation as the basis for conditional
issuance. An appeal of an ownership or control link which tests a person's relationship to a violator or to a violation
does not test the validity of the underlying violation. To the extent that the provisions of a State program allow for
conditional issuance based upon the appeal of an ownership or control link, those provisions must be considered less
effective than comparable Federal provisions. See 30 CFR parts 730 and 732.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in many instances, the existence of ownership or control links in AVS may be readily discovered by the presumed
controllers, and the accuracy of those links administratively challenged prior to the actual denial of a permit by
a regulatory authority. An appeal challenging the current status of a violation does not constitute a direct challenge
to the validity of the violation at the time that it was cited. Instead, it would test whether the violation is currently
abated or not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An appeal as to the existence of the violation at the time it was cited could constitute a challenge as to the validity
of the violation. Nevertheless, there is nothing in the Act or OSM's regulations which requires that such an appeal,
undertaken by an owner or controller of a violator after standard appeal times have run, be the basis for conditional
issuance. Conditional issuance is particularly inappropriate when the controller's ability to compel the controlled
entity to act is taken into account. A controller has the capacity to force the controlled entity to abate or to appeal
and would have had such rights at the time that the violation was cited. Thus, a timely appeal of the violation, directly
made through administrative or judicial tribunals, could have been made at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter argued that due process protection in the proposed rules should be enhanced. In substance, this commenter
asserted that it is unfair to deny permits to applicants or to subject active permits to treatment as improvidently
issued permits where the applicants or permittees are subjectively unaware of their ownership or control links to
violators or of the import of such relationships. Accordingly, this commenter proposed that such persons should
have extended opportunities for ``corrections and questions'' without the risk of permit denial or revocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion, but does not believe that further proposed rules are needed or that amendments
to the final rules should be made to reflect the commenter's proposal. The AVS Office will work with anyone at any time,
including when there is no pending permitting action, to answer questions and make appropriate corrections to ownership
and control information in the database. Data in the system is available on-line to any interested party, and the AVS
Office will provide print-outs of AVS data on request. The AVS Office will also provide training to interested parties
on the use of the system. The AVS Office routinely works with major companies to insure that their ownership and control
information in the system is kept current. Given all these factors, there is no ``risk of permit denial'' necessarily
involved in the resolution of an ownership and control link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, applicants and permittees are deemed to be aware of the law. The ownership and control rules were published
in October, 1988. Since that time, applicants and permittees could reasonably be expected to be aware of the regulations
and could have acted to cure any outstanding violations or to resolve any erroneous links in the AVS which would form
the basis for a permit denial or revocation. Thus, any ``unfair surprise'' to applicants or permittees posited by
the commenter is not an actual problem. Accordingly, it is entirely legitimate to deny permits to such applicants
or permittees when they are linked to violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, permit applicants are required to provide full ownership and control information at the time of permit application.
See 30 CFR 778.13; 778.14. Permittees are required to update relevant ownership and control information in a timely
manner. See 30 CFR 774.17. Thus, the proposed remedy offered by the commenter is already a requirement of the rules.
Finally, in the unlikely event that a person has been unfairly subjected to permit denial by the process, that person
could still seek temporary relief from OHA in accordance with procedures governing such relief provided by OHA's
and OSM's regulations.

Primacy

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry and State commenters asserted a number of concerns relating to the impact of the proposed rules upon the primacy
of States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, industry commenters argued that the proposed rules and the AVS itself impermissibly substitute Federal
authority for State authority in the permitting process. They argued that, under the principle of State primacy,
once a State's program has been approved by OSM, the State should have sole authority for making decisions with respect
to permit issuance, including the determination of ownership and control matters. They asserted that requiring
a State to query the AVS before making a permitting decision takes the decision out of the hands of the State and transfers
substantive control of the decision to OSM which controls the content of the AVS. As evidence of this Federal control,
industry commenters cited, with disapproval, provisions of the proposed rules which provide that challenges of
ownership and control information on the AVS must be made to OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees. First, in the cases of

 No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C.), coal industry interests advanced similar primacy arguments attacking the agency's
ownership and control rules published in 1988. OSM responded to those arguments in detail demonstrating that the
ownership and control rules support State programs, rather than undermine them. Copies of these briefs are being
placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking. OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department
in those briefs herein by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the purpose of AVS is to assist, rather than to undermine, the States in the exercise of their primary authority
for the implementation of their approved programs. The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require that the regulatory
authority deny a permit to an applicant where ``information available'' to the regulatory authority indicates that
any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant is currently in violation'' of the Act or certain
other governmental laws. See section 510(c) of the Act. In a State which has an approved program to regulate surface
coal mining operations pursuant to section 503 of the Act, neither OSM nor AVS decides whether or not to issue a permit
to an applicant in that State. The State regulatory authority is the decisionmaker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the commenter's assertions, however, the Federal government has an ongoing role in this system of State
primacy. The Act and Federal regulations require that OSM assist the States in the implementation of their programs
under the Act and that OSM provide oversight of the State regulatory authorities' activities. See sections 102(g),
201(c), 503, 504, 505, and 521 of the Act; 30 CFR parts 732, 733, and 842.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the State's role as primary decisionmaker, the AVS is a tool, developed by the Federal government
in concert with the States, which provides information in a convenient mode, readily accessible to State regulatory
authorities. It is a source of relevant ``information available'' of the type which the State regulatory authority
is required by the Act to consider when the State regulatory authority decides whether to issue a permit to conduct
surface coal mining operations. Absent AVS, a State regulatory authority would have to laboriously contact other
State regulatory authorities for violation and ownership and control information or would have to simply reply upon
the voluntary disclosure of information supplied by applicants or by public-spirited citizens. That OSM has taken
the lead in developing the AVS and in proposing to require to use of AVS through rulemaking is consistent with the Federal
government's role to assist and to oversee the State regulatory authorities. Even then, the content of AVS is the product
of the efforts of both State regulatory authorities and OSM working together to incorporate into AVS ownership and
control and violation information developed through their regulatory programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, a State's authority to make a decision with respect to a permit application is primary and is unimpaired
by anything in the proposed rules and by the State's use of AVS. To the extent that the rules support OSM's oversight
of the State's decisions, such oversight is mandated by and consistent with the provisions of the Act and the regulations
cited above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the proposed rules provide that challenges of information already on AVS be made to OSM, such provisions
do not impair primacy. Instead, the rules recognize that the Federal government is uniquely situated to maintain
the accuracy and integrity of a nationwide database that will be used by many States. To be sure, each of the State regulatory
authorities has a valuable contribution to make to the quality of AVS information. Yet, the individual States may
have differing perspectives on ownership and control issues. The potential for inconsistency is significant_particularly
with respect to ownership and control decisions relating to multistate companies with complex organizational structures.
Also, potential challengers of such information need, if possible, a single point at which they can challenge ownership
or control information which will be used in many States and which, absent such a locus, could subject them to inconsistent
outcomes. Such a role for OSM is consistent with the role for the agency envisioned by SMCRA. See sections 201(c)(9)
and 201(c)(12) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it must be recognized that the decision to deny a permit because an operator is linked to a violation through
ownership or control can be an unpopular one, subjecting a local economy to stress. An operator may claim that he ``has
been put out of business'' by the State regulatory authority. This is one area where the Federal government can assist
the States by accepting the responsibility of maintaining ownership and control information which may ultimately
lead to permit denials in the various States. Federal acceptance of such a role helps to assure the integrity, consistency,
and accuracy of ownership and control information on the AVS. It is also consistent with one of the purposes of the Act
which is ``to insure that competition in interstate commerce among sellers of coal produced in different States will
not be used to undermine the ability of the several States to improve and maintain adequate standards of coal mining
operations within their borders.'' See section 101(g) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, even with the State using information on AVS as part of its information gathering incident to making a determination
with respect to a permit application, the State retains the authority, subject to Federal oversight, to decide whether
to issue the permit or not. Appeals of such a decision are made to the appropriate State reviewing tribunal, in accordance
with the provisions of the State program. Also, the final rules published today make clear that the State regulatory
authority which issues a permit has responsibility, subject to OSM's oversight, for determining the ownership or
control relationships of the permit. See &sect;773.25(b)(1)(ii). Contrary to commenters' assertions, the State's
use of AVS does not transmute the process into a Federal proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that a State denies a permit based upon information in AVS indicating that the applicant is linked through
ownership or control to an outstanding violation of the Act, such denial is made based upon the mandate of section 510(c)
as implemented by the applicable State program, rather than some extraordinary Federal intervention in the State's
process. A State regulatory authority denying a permit based upon ownership or control information shown in AVS would
be obligated under the Act to take the same action based upon a phone call, letter, or other communication from another
regulatory authority advising of an applicant's ownership or control of a surface coal mining operation in current
violation of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it must be emphasized that the cooperation of all regulatory authorities, including the States and OSM,
is necessary to facilitate the implementation of section 510(c) of the Act. Information on violations wherever they
have occurred is needed by each regulatory authority considering a permit application to ensure true compliance
with the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act. It is unreasonable, ineffective, and inefficient for each regulatory
authority to attempt to develop such information by itself. It is both reasonable and prudent for OSM to fulfill this
role. See sections 201(c)(9) and 201(c)(12) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further asserted that the proposed rules will have the effect of ``Balkanizing'' (i.e., dispersing)
regulatory authorities' permitting decisions. They were especially concerned about the provisions of &sect;773.26
of the proposed rules which allocated responsibility to particular regulatory authorities to make decisions with
respect to ownership or control relationships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;773.26 allocated responsibility among the respective regulatory authorities such that the regulatory
authority before which an application is pending would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the
ownership or control relationships of the applicant; the regulatory authority that issued a permit would have had
authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permittee; the State
regulatory authority that issued a State violation notice would have had authority for making decisions with respect
to the ownership or control relationships of persons cited in the violation; and the regulatory authority that issued
a violation notice, whether State or Federal, would have had authority for making decisions concerning the status
of the violation covered by the notice. The proposed rule provided that these allocations of authority were subject
to OSM's oversight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, the industry commenters asserted that the provisions of this proposed section would impermissibly
weaken the authority of the State regulatory authority before whom a permit application is pending. They asserted
that the allocations of authority contained in the proposed rule would create confusion and delay in the permitting
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with these comments. The interaction between the Federal government and the States described above
does not constitute a ``balkanization'' of the permit application process. Nor will such interaction lead to confusion
in the permit application process. Such interaction is consistent with the mandate of SMCRA to implement section
510(c) within a context of State primacy supported by Federal oversight. The proposed rules and the final rules adopted
today attempt to establish a road map which is consistent with SMCRA for the making of decisions with respect to ownership
or control and for the development of information to be used in AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the allocations of responsibility are consistent with the requirements of the Act. The provisions of section
510(c) of the Act mandate a separation of decisionmaking in the permit application process which commenters might
characterize as ``balkanization.'' The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act are very explicit in stating that
permits shall be denied to applicants who own or control surface coal mining operations with outstanding violations
of the Act ``until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected
to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or agency which has jurisdiction over such violation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Act contemplates that the State regulatory authority before which an application is pending could require
information from another State regulatory authority with respect to violations issued by the other State regulatory
authority before issuing a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the Act is equally specific in establishing a mandated role for the Federal government to oversee the States
in the implementation of their State regulatory programs. See sections 201(c)(1); 503; 504; 505; and 521 of the Act.
Thus, to the extent that the proposed rules and the final rules adopted today envision the exercise of Federal oversight,
such a role is responsive to the provisions of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, while the proposed rule and the final rule, modified and renumbered as &sect;773.25, will be compared and
discussed in more detail below in this preamble, it is appropriate to offer some responses at this point since these
critical comments refer to the issue of relationships between governments. These comments invoke issues of State
primacy. Contrary to commenters' assertions, the rules in question allocate responsibility in a manner which is
supportive of, and consistent with, State primacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, the final rule provides that a State regulatory authority which issues a violation has responsibility,
subject to OSM oversight, for identifying the ownership and control relationships of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(iii).
The State regulatory authority which issues a violation has the greatest interest, among those regulatory authorities
with an interest in the ownership and control relationships of that violation, in seeing that the persons responsible
for the violation abate the violation. Such abatement directly improves the environmental quality of the State which
issues the violation. Accordingly, the State which issued a violation should have the first opportunity, subject
to Federal oversight, to identify the owners or controllers of the violation. Well before OSM made its proposals in
September, 1991, which form the basis for today's final rules, both SMCRA and Federal regulations recognized that
a violation had to be corrected to the satisfaction of the agency that has jurisdiction over the violation, before
a permit could be issued by a regulatory authority. See section 510(c) of SMCRA; 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, today's final provisions further recognize the relative access to ownership and control information
that the interested regulatory authorities have at each stage of the process. The regulatory authority which issued
the violation is in the best position to investigate and to develop all of the relevant facts about the violation, including
the identification of those responsible for the violation. The violation was committed within the jurisdiction
of the regulatory authority which issued the violation. That regulatory authority has access to the actors on the
ground at the surface coal mining operation and would be able to question them to identify ownership and control information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar analysis can be offered in support of affording the agency before which an application is pending responsibility
for identifying the ownership and control of the application. This regulatory authority has the applicant before
it and can inquire of the applicant directly with respect to any ownership and control information contained in the
application. Thus, the regulatory authority before which an application is pending has responsibility, subject
to Federal oversight, to decide the ownership and control relationships of the application. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulatory authority which has issued a permit has ongoing authority for the permittee's surface coal mining operations
on the permitted site. Thus, this regulatory authority has responsibility, subject to Federal oversight, to decide
the ownership and control relationships of the permit. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, OSM recognizes that the industry commenters are deeply troubled by any use of the AVS in the permit application
process and any application of OSM's ownership or control rules as contained at 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b)(1). Nevertheless,
OSM has accepted the mandate of Congress to develop and implement the AVS because ``the AVS is essential to effective
enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA].'' See Report of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, Senate Report No. 103&hyph;114, at page 47 (July 28, 1993). Thus, the allocation of responsibilities
for the various regulatory authorities contained in the proposed rules and the final rules adopted today also attempt
to reflect the pragmatic realities of implementing a national computer system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once a decision has been made to go forward with a national computer system to aid the enforcement of section 510(c)
of SMCRA, certain pragmatic realities must be recognized. First, information will be coming to the computer system
from many sources. As each State regulatory authority analyzes ownership and control information contained in permit
applications and reports such information to AVS, such information is incorporated into AVS. A national computer
system requires centralized management and maintenance to assure the accuracy and consistency of information.
Centralized management provides a focus of responsibility when inaccuracies or technical problems are identified.
Accordingly, the Federal government, acting through OSM, has responsibility for such system management. At the
same time, the States are primary actors in the permit application process and critically important actors in the
development and the support of AVS. With respect to AVS, the States play a critical role in using the computer system
as an information resource in the permit application process and in supplying information to AVS gleaned from the
permit application process and other research.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the need for centralized management of the database, OSM has such a role with respect to the AVS and
the information contained therein. As will be discussed below in the discussion of specific sections of the final
rules, one of the changes made from the September, 1991, proposal was to place language in the final rule clarifying
OSM's plenary role with respect to the content of ownership or control information in the AVS. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(3)(i).
OSM will also have sole responsibility over the ownership and control relationships incident to Federal violations.
See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(2). Further, OSM will exercise oversight over State regulatory authorities' activities. See
30 CFR 773.25(b)(3)(ii). This role provided for OSM under the final rule, consistent with that proposed under the
proposed rule, recognizes that, under the Act, while the States are subject to Federal oversight, OSM is not subject
to the oversight of State regulatory authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry commenters asserted that the proposed rules will create confusion and conflict among the States with
the potential for conflicting decisions on ownership and control by multiple State regulatory authorities and OSM.
Again, OSM disagrees with the commenters' characterization of the effect of the rules. As indicated above, the proposed
rules and the final rules clearly allocate responsibility among the various regulatory agencies. The regulatory
authority before which an application is pending decides whether or not to issue a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM retains the authority to oversee the decision of the State. Indeed, OSM's role as controller of information already
on AVS and as overseer of State ownership or control decisions will reduce, not create, confusion and conflict by establishing
one final authority to make decisions in cases where disagreements among States might occur about information already
on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the rules do not inappropriately disperse decisionmaking among State and Federal regulatory authorities
with respect to ownership and control. Further, prior to the publication of these final rules, OSM's AVS Office and
the States have worked well together to implement AVS and the ownership and control regulations promulgated in 1988.
To the extent that there have been disagreements between OSM's AVS Office and the State regulatory counterparts,
such disagreements have been addressed expeditiously and resolved in a collegial and cooperative manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed rules did not sufficiently address the issues of conflicts between
the States and OSM and between the States themselves on matters of ownership and control. OSM believes that these issues
will be addressed adequately by the provisions of 30 CFR 773.25. That section is based upon proposed &sect;773.26
and establishes the relative responsibilities of agencies responsible for making ownership and control decisions.
As noted previously, this regulation is discussed in detail below. Within the framework of State primacy, OSM will
exercise its oversight role to review State ownership or control decisions, in response to citizen complaints or
as otherwise appropriate, to assure the integrity of the AVS. See 30 CFR 773.12; 842.11; and 843.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asserted, in substance, that the proposed rules did not go far enough in imposing Federal responsibility.
This commenter proposed that all matters relating to ownership and control under section 510(c) of the Act should
be OSM's responsibility. While OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion, OSM must reject this proposal. As OSM
indicated above, the Act establishes a system of State primacy with Federal oversight and assistance to the States.
While it is understandable that some persons would prefer that the entire responsibility for permit decisionmaking
be shouldered by the Federal government, such a system would require a significant restructuring of the statutory
framework established by the Act. In contrast to this, today's final rules address the responsibilities established
by section 510(c) of the Act in a manner more consistent with the statutory framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned whether OSM had given adequate consideration to the implications of the rules upon Federal
and State relations. As the above discussion indicates, OSM has considered, in detail, the effect of AVS and these
rules upon the relationship between OSM and the State regulatory authorities and believes that the rules are consistent
with the framework for Federal and State relations established by the Act. Further, as indicated above, the working
relationship between OSM's AVS Office and its State colleagues has been heretofore very productive and cooperative.
OSM believes that State and Federal cooperation on AVS matters has been, overall, a significant success. Accordingly,
OSM intends to continue to work closely and cooperatively with State regulatory authorities to resolve issues related
to the implementation of AVS and section 510(c) of the Act.

Citizen Participation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters representing environmental groups criticized the proposed rules as not containing sufficient provision
for citizen participation. They asserted that citizens should be afforded the opportunity to add ownership and control
links to AVS. They further argued that citizens should have appeal rights when the regulatory authority denies their
requests to add ownership or control links and that citizens should have rights of intervention when decisions are
made to sever links. They also urged that citizens should have explicit rights to request enforcement action with
respect to improvidently issued permits, with respect to other provisions of the rules relating to ownership and
control, and with respect to the imposition of sanctions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM strongly supports citizen participation and agrees that opportunities for citizen participation need to be
addressed in the rules governing ownership and control. OSM further agrees that the proposed rules did not sufficiently
address these issues in the September, 1991, proposal. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, however, the agency
has a responsibility to propose regulations for public comment, prior to finalizing such regulations. The changes
proposed by commenters would represent significant modifications of the September, 1991, proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM does not consider it appropriate to incorporate commenters' proposals into today's final rules without
first providing opportunity for comment to the regulated community, the States, and the public generally. While
OSM could delay finalization of today's rules to allow for such proposal and for opportunity for comment, OSM does
not believe that the public interest would be served by such delay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, suggestions made by the commenters are worthy of further consideration. Accordingly, at some future
date, OSM may present proposals to respond to the concerns expressed by the commenters. Until such proposals are made,
however, the interests of concerned citizens should be asserted pursuant to the provisions of 30 CFR 773.13, 842.11,
842.12, 843.21 and other regulations providing for citizen participation, as appropriate. In this respect, if citizens
disagree with a decision of OSM finding that an ownership or control link does not exist, citizens can challenge such
decision by demanding a Federal inspection of relevant permits affected by such decision in accordance with the current
provisions of 30 CFR 842.12. If OSM rejects their demand to conduct an inspection, citizens can seek review of such
rejection and the issues related thereto pursuant to 30 CFR 842.15 to the Director or his designee and, if necessary,
to OHA in accordance with 43 CFR part 4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM's AVS Office will receive and consider ownership or control information from concerned citizens as
part of OSM's ongoing research activities to incorporate ownership or control and violation information into the
AVS database. Such information is relevant and will be used by the agency in the making of ownership or control determinations
and for inclusion, upon verification by the agency, into AVS. OSM strongly encourages concerned citizens, environmental
advocates, and members of the industry to come forward with information relevant to ownership or control matters.
It is in everyone's interest for the AVS to contain the most complete, comprehensive, and accurate information possible.

 In the proposed rule, OSM deleted the definition of ``violation notice'' previously contained in the regulations
and transferred such definition in expanded form to &sect;773.5. The final rule is identical to the proposed rule.
As described below, the definition of ``violation notice'' refers to the types of violations of the Act or other laws
which will form the basis for a regulatory authority to deny a permit application under the provisions of &sect;773.15(b).

 In the proposed rule, OSM had included an amendment to the Table of Contents to provide for a proposed rule governing
procedures for the challenge of ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS. Since OSM has determined not to go
forward with that portion of the proposal, that reference is not included in the final Table of Contents adopted today.
Also, since OSM has deferred action with respect to the adoption of proposed &sect;773.27 to a subsequent rulemaking,
that reference has also been deleted. The final Table of Contents is adopted as described in Summary of Rules Adopted.

 The proposed rule added certain definitions to &sect;773.5. Such definitions included the terms ``Applicant/Violator

``Violation notice.'' Such definitions were necessary to an understanding of the proposed comprehensive regulations
relating to the implementation of AVS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry commenters objected that the proposed definition of ``violation notice'' contained in the regulation
was too broad. They argued that the proposed definition, insofar as it applies to a ``Federal violation notice'' should
be explicitly limited to violations of environmental laws. Further, they asserted that the definition inappropriately
included written communications and demand letters as ``violations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' concern over the need for an explicit limitation for violations of environmental
laws in the definition of a ``Federal violation notice.'' Commenters conceded that such a limitation is already contained
in the proposed definition of ``violation notice.'' The definition of a Federal violation notice is modified by any
limitations contained in the definition of a violation notice. Accordingly, there is no need for an explicit additional
limitation to address commenters' concerns. It is already clear that it is limited to violations of environmental
laws. Thus, OSM has adopted the proposed definition of ``Federal violation notice'' as a final definition without
modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, commenters asserted that the proposed rule inappropriately expanded the definition of violation notice
to include various written communications and demand letters. They asserted that a demand letter could somehow preclude
a permit applicant from pursuing a good faith appeal and that a person's ability to challenge the debt would depend
on whether the agency attempted to collect the debt. In substance, commenters took exception to the prospect of a demand
letter being the basis for a permit denial when the demand letter contains notice of a delinquent civil penalty and
the applicable statute of limitations has expired precluding further action to collect the debt. They asserted that
the proposed rule impermissibly expands the types of violations for which a person could be subject to permit block
without affording the person a right of timely challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Again, OSM disagrees with commenters' analysis. First, it must be emphasized that the type of document is less significant
than the violation of which it provides notice. The document is merely a vehicle for communicating notice of the substantive
violation. The documents listed in the proposed definition merely recount the possible types of documents providing
notice and do not substantively expand the universe of violations which would be the basis for permit denial under
section 510(c) of the Act and the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). The substantive violation, rather than the type of
document, forms the basis for a permit denial under the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
Pursuant to those provisions, a regulatory authority is required to refuse permit issuance where available information
indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by an applicant is currently in violation of
the Act or other indicated laws. Delinquent fees or penalties which have ripened to the level for which a demand letter
is indicated constitute available information for which an applicant will be held accountable and which a regulatory
authority must take into account in any permit decision. Contrary to commenters' assertions, the filing of a suit
to collect delinquent reclamation fees or civil penalties is not a condition precedent to such debts being valid violations
or a condition precedent to such debts being considered the bases for permit denial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the commenters' concerns about rights of challenge incident to demand letters, OSM believes that
current quality control procedures will prevent the entry of unripe violations into the system. Furthermore, with
this final rule and with OHA's rule which is being contemporaneously published, OSM and OHA have acted to provide a
means for applicants to obtain temporary relief from permit blocks where they are likely to prevail on the merits.
Thus, if a violation has not actually ripened into the basis for a permit block, temporary relief could be sought. The
discussion of these provisions of the final rule are contained at the discussion of 30 CFR 773.25 below in this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters also objected to the prospect that a demand letter or other notice could contain notice of a delinquent
civil penalty the collection of which is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. In substance, they argued
that such a notice should not be the basis for a permit denial. OSM disagrees. In 1988, OSM addressed similar concerns
expressed by commenters with respect to the ownership and control rules. OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter asserted that permit blocking cannot occur for any civil penalty which has not been reduced to judgment
within the applicable statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. 2462 (barring an action, suit or proceeding for enforcement
of any civil fine, penalty unless commenced within five years).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSMRE disagree[s] with the commenter's position. Although the statute of limitations may provide a defense to suit
for collection of money filed five years following the entry of a final order, it does not invalidate the final order
or cancel the underlying debt, which will continue to be listed in the Applicant Violator System and will result in
blocking the issuance of a permit.

Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38884 (October 3, 1988). The agency considers this position to be sound and has no intention
of changing course. Accordingly, this criticism of the proposed definition is rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters representing industry interests asserted that the definition of violation contained in the
rule was overbroad in that it potentially included violations of laws other than SMCRA as the basis for permit denial.
These commenters proposed that the rule incorporate explicit limitations to the effect that only violations relevant
to SMCRA or consistent with the environmental protection standards of SMCRA be the basis for permit denial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM rejects the commenters' proposals as unnecessary. To the extent that the final definition of ``violation notice''
describes the type of violation for which the listed types of notice will be provided, the final rule is intended to
track the language of section 510(c) of the Act. That provision of the Act states that the basis for permit denial includes
violations of the Act ``and any law, rule or regulation of the United States, or of any department or agency in the United
States pertaining to air or water environmental protection 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
incurred by the applicant in connection with any surface coal mining operation *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Emphasis added.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters' concerns are already addressed by the Act and the proposed and final definitions of ``violation notice''
which incorporate the above-emphasized language of the Act. This language requires that violations which support
permit denial must be those pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred in connection with any surface
coal mining operation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any air or water environmental protection violations incurred in connection with a surface coal mining operation
would be of a type ``relevant to SMCRA.'' If the violations are committed not in connection with a surface coal mining
operation, they would not be a basis for the denial of a permit under section 510(c) of the Act. Thus, OSM does not believe
that a change in the proposed rule language to reflect commenters' concern is needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing certain State regulatory authorities also criticized the proposed definition of ``violation
notice'' as being too broad and was concerned that such definition, when read with the provisions of 30 CFR 778.14(c),
would lead to ``nationwide gridlock'' or undue delay in State regulatory authorities' processing of permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition of ``violation notice'' is designed to incorporate the full range of violations which would
form the basis for permit denial under section 510(c) of SMCRA. The definition is intended to implement the statutory
definition, not expand such definition. A more limited definition would be an impermissible constraint upon the
broad language of the Act. Accordingly, OSM rejects the view that the proposed definition is overbroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further disagrees with commenter's view that applicants' reporting of such violation notices in accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 778.14(c) will lead to undue delay in the processing of permit applications. Applicants
must supply complete information with respect to outstanding violations to enable regulatory authorities to make
informed decisions as to permit issuance as mandated by section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The reporting
of such information by an applicant may, indeed, lead to permit denial. That, however, constitutes with the mandates
of the Act, not inappropriate delay or stalemate. OSM is confident that OSM and Sate regulatory authorities can evaluate
and use the information provided by applicants with respect to outstanding violations in accordance with the definitions
of ``violation'' and ``violation notice'' along with information contained in AVS to meet the requirements of the
Act in a timely fashion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter additionally urged that OSM retain the limited definition of ``violation notice'' previously
contained in 30 CFR 701.5 because such definition is more ``realistic'' in its scope and because there is a need for
such a definition across OSM's regulations, not just those contained in 30 CFR part 773.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Again, OSM disagrees with commenter's views. The definition of ``violation notice'' previously contained in the
regulations did not identify the types of violations of the Act or other laws which would form the basis for a regulatory
authority to deny a permit under 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). A fuller definition of the term which would encompass these types
of violations as mandated by section 510(c) of the Act was necessary for incorporation by reference into a proposed
amended version of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). While commenter has asserted that there is a need for a general definition
of the term ``violation notice'' across OSM's regulations, commenter has identified no urgent need for a universal
definition of the term that would outweigh the need to clarify the provisions of 30 CFR part 773. Further, in the event
that it becomes apparent that the implementation of other regulations have been somehow significantly compromised
by the deletion of the general definition of ``violation notice'' contained in 30 CFR 701.5, OSM can address these
issues as necessary. Accordingly, OSM must reject the commenter's position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, a commenter urged that any violations be in a final, unappealable posture before they can be the basis for
permit denial. OSM disagrees with the commenter's characterization of the current state of the law and with what the
commenter believes ought to prevail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, Federal regulations which predate the proposed rules and today's final rules already provide that permits
may be conditionally issued based upon a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal testing the validity
of the underlying violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(ii)&hyph;(b)(2). Thus, contrary to commenter's implication,
permits are not necessarily denied while violations are under appeal. The burden, however, is on a violator to assert
appeal rights in good faith and in a timely manner. There is no legitimate reason to afford additional appeal rights
to people who have squandered their opportunity to appeal. In the absence of a timely appeal, a violation should be
the basis for denial of a permit, in accordance with the provisions of section 510(c). In this preamble under the topic
captioned ``Due Process,'' OSM has responded in detail to commenters who have asserted that permits should be conditioned
upon the appeals of ownership or control links or upon the appeals of the existence of the violation asserted by owners
or controllers of violations after standard appeal times for the violations have run. As stated in this preamble,
OSM rejects these assertions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the commenter implied that permits should be issued unconditionally during the pendency of an appeal
of a violation, OSM also rejects this proposal. Under this proposal, a violator could commit a violation at his or her
surface coal mining operation; take a timely appeal; and then be approved unconditionally for permit issuance at
another site. Following the failure of his or her appeal, he or she could continue to mine on the new site with no interruption
or termination of his or her rights on the new site. This course of events violates the provisions of section 510(c)
of the Act which mandate that regulatory authorities deny permits when applicants have current violations of the
Act or other laws. Also, the commenter's proposal is inconsistent with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(ii)&hyph;(b)(2)
cited above which allow only conditional issuance, rather than unconditional issuance, for permits issued to applicants
who have appealed outstanding violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that final rule, OSM has adopted the definitions of ``Federal violation notice'' and ``violation notice'' as proposed
and without any of the changes requested by commenters.

In the proposed rule, the definition of ``ownership or control link'' included references to ownership or control
``under paragraph (b)'' of 30 CFR 773.5. Since the publication date of that proposal, OSM has proposed changes in the
definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' contained at 30 CFR 773.5. See Proposed Rule, Definitions

(June 28, 1993). If some of those proposed changes are ultimately adopted, the reference to ownership or control as
defined by ``paragraph (b)'' contained in the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' would be inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, to assure flexibility, OSM has deleted the reference to ``paragraph (b)'' of 30 CFR 773.5 from the final
definition of ``ownership or control link.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' indicated that a link included presumptive ownership
or control relationships which had not ``been successfully rebutted under the provisions of &sect;&sect;773.24
and 773.26 or &sect;&sect;773.25 and 773.26 or under the provisions of part 775 of this chapter and &sect;773.26 of
this part.'' As is discussed below in this preamble, OSM has deleted proposed section 773.25, procedures for challenging
ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS and has renumbered proposed &sect;773.26 as final &sect;773.25,
standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations. The final definition of ``ownership
or control link'' has been amended to reflect these changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rules are adopted containing the provisions described in this preamble above at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Rules Adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.10_Information Collection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have revised &sect;773.10 which contained a list of the existing information collection
requirements in part 773 and also the OMB clearance number indicating OMB approval of the information collection
requirements. The proposed rule revision would have updated &sect;773.10 by including the proposed AVS-related
rules containing information collection requirements. The proposed revision provided an estimate of the average
public reporting burden per response of three hours, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
The proposed section also listed the addresses for OSM and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) where comments
on the information collection requirements may be sent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters asserted that the estimate of three hours to prepare an average response for the collection of
information required was unrealistically low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with commenters' assertion. The three hours estimated burden was an estimated average, rather than
a predicted figure for the burden of a single, typical response. The calculation of an ``average'' response means
that there are some responses which may require larger amounts of time to prepare and that there are also some responses
which may require significantly lesser amounts of time. It is entirely reasonable to expect that the reporting and
information collection burden of these regulations may vary among entities depending upon the entities' size and
structural complexity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, once companies have researched and compiled their particular ownership or control information, they have
done the basic research which can be used for future compliance. This basic ownership or control research will then
be readily available to the company and the company only needs to update such research to reflect changes in ownership
or control for future applications. Once entities and regulatory authorities develop experience in complying with
the regulations, they will also develop experience in collecting, storing, retrieving, and reporting the necessary
compliance information. A number of large companies have told OSM that they have already collected and stored their
ownership or control information in a computerized database or are in the process of doing so. Once such information
has been so stored, it would be readily accessible and easily retrieved for compliance purposes. Thus, the amount
of time required to prepare a typical response under these regulations should diminish over time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, in the final rule adopted today, OSM has recalculated the estimated time for compliance in accordance
with standard procedures required by the OMB. OSM has concluded that the public reporting burden for the collection
of information required by part 773 as amended by these final regulations is four and one half hours per response, rather
than three hours. The final rule also has been modified to delete specific references to the particular sections of
part 773 which are relevant for information collection purposes. Instead, OSM has provided a reference to the collection
of information required by 30 CFR part 773, since this part encompasses all sections of part 773, including the final
rules adopted today, which generate an information collection obligation.

Section 773.15_Review of permit applications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the proposed rule. OSM proposed to amend 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to refer to relevant amended definitions and AVS-related
rules as the basis for a regulatory authority's analysis when reviewing a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation required the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information concerning
violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such information would include that obtained pursuant to &sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application
information); &sect;773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information); amended &sect;778.13
(identification of interests); and amended &sect;778.14 (violation information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While those regulations will be discussed in detail later in this preamble, the net effect of referencing such provisions
in &sect;773.15(b)(1) was to assure that the regulatory authority makes a decision with respect to permit issuance
or denial based upon complete information relating to ownership, control, and violations. Such compete information
includes the mandated use of AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would have further added a paragraph (b)(4) to 30 CFR 773.15. This provision would have provided
that delinquent civil penalties for violations cited prior to October 3, 1988, not form the basis for a permit block
against persons linked through ownership or control to such violations, where reclamation had been completed in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable regulatory program and where, with respect to each cessation order
for which a delinquent civil penalty exists, such persons had paid $750 of the amount of such penalty to the regulatory
authority which issued such cessation order. In substance, this regulation proposed a ``safe harbor'' with respect
to owners or controllers of delinquent civil penalties cited prior to October 3, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed amendments to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) would also have deleted the presumption contained in
the then current version of that rule that allows a regulatory authority, in evaluating whether a surface coal mining
operation owned or controlled by a permit applicant is currently in violation of the law, to presume, in the absence
of a failure to abate cessation order (FTACO), that a notice of violation (NOV) has been or is being corrected, except
where evidence to the contrary is set forth in the permit application, or where the notice of violation is issued for
non-payment of abandoned mine reclamation fees or civil penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the proposed amendment to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) would have incorporated by reference the amended definition
of ``violation notice'' and the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' contained in proposed &sect;773.5
by requiring a regulatory authority to review ``all reasonably available information concerning violation notices
and ownership or control links involving the applicant.'' This proposed change would have eliminated the need for
the detailed list contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) of the types of violation information which a regulatory authority
must review as part of the application review process provided by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The two issues which generated the most significant comments were the proposed deletion of the presumption of NOV
abatement and the proposed safe harbor for owners or controllers of surface coal mining operations with delinquent
civil penalties for violations issued prior to October 3, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these issues to be addressed is the proposed deletion of the presumption of NOV abatement. Commenters
representing a number of State regulatory authorities strongly objected to the deletion of the presumption. They
asserted that the elimination of the presumption would lead to ``nationwide gridlock.'' They asserted that such
a rule provision would lead to automatic appeals of all NOV's; that State regulatory authorities would have to expend
significant resources tracking the course of NOV's and NOV appeals; that companies operating before multiple State
regulatory authorities would never be able to definitively prove that NOV's were being abated such that they could
be issued permits; and that such efforts would be a significant waste of State and Federal resources. They asserted
that 80%&hyph;85% of all NOV's are resolved and never ripen into CO's in any event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, commenters representing industry interests strongly criticized the proposed deletion of the NOV presumption
as both impractical and counterproductive. They asserted that the proposed deletion of the presumption would be
especially burdensome on large multi-state corporations. They questioned whether such entities would be able to
keep track of the abatement status of the NOV's of their many operating subsidiaries and contract miners. They further
asserted that most NOV's are routinely and timely abated. They argued that eliminating the NOV presumption would
lead to information overload in the permit application process; to increased costs and delays in permit processing;
and to increased errors in data collection. They argued that the deletion of the presumption would require the reallocation
of personnel from enforcement to document processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the positions of State regulatory authorities and the industry, one commenter representing environmental
advocacy groups supported the deletion of the NOV presumption, asserting that the deletion of the presumption would
lead to better tracking of the status of violations and to faster remediation of violations. Another commenter did
concede, however, that it would be difficult for the OSM to keep AVS accurate and current with respect to violation
information if the presumption of NOV abatement in the absence of an FTACO was eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM considers the arguments raised by the State regulatory authorities and by the industry to be persuasive. OSM must
give particular consideration to the concerns expressed by the State regulatory authorities on this issue. These
agencies have the responsibility of implementing the ownership and control process. If the State regulatory authorities
believe that the complete elimination of the presumption of NOV abatement will impose a significantly increased
burden upon them for limited environmental return, this position cannot be discounted. OSM recognizes that there
may be a potential benefit in having multiple jurisdictions tracking the course of NOV's for purposes of permit issuance.
Such multiple supervision could theoretically encourage prompt abatement. Nevertheless, the mechanics of implementing
such a process through AVS and other means would be sufficiently complex so as to create significant uncertainty among
permit applicants and regulatory authorities. Such uncertainty outweighs the benefits of the complete elimination
of the presumption of NOV abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the environmentalists' arguments, OSM recognizes that there is a theoretical, potential benefit
in multiple regulatory authorities tracking the course of an NOV for purposes of permit issuance. Under this scenario,
a State would deny a permit to an applicant based upon his or her being linked through ownership or control to an NOV in
another State even though the abatement period for the NOV had not expired. The threat of permit denial could enhance
the prospect for prompt abatement of that NOV.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, the mechanics of implementing this process with respect to AVS would be complex and would create such
uncertainty as to outweigh the benefits. Assuming that NOV's whose abatement period had not yet expired and which
had not yet generated FTACO's were loaded onto AVS, OSM would have to check the status of such NOV's and continually
update such information on AVS. It is unclear whether OSM would be able to keep up with the changing status of NOV's and
incorporate such information in a timely manner into AVS. This would add an additional element of uncertainty with
respect to the currency of violation information in AVS. OSM believes it is more desirable to have information in AVS
which is both current and reliable, so that State regulatory authorities may depend on the system during the permit
application review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM believes that the decision to retain at least a limited presumption of NOV abatement is consistent with
positions taken by the Department of the Interior in previous litigation. In litigation relating to &sect;773.15(b)(1)
and related matters before the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, the Secretary advised the court that
he had decided to reconsider the issue of whether, in the absence of an FTACO, the regulatory authority may presume
that an NOV has been or is being corrected. The Secretary further advised the court that he would, if appropriate, engage
in further rulemaking on the subject as expeditiously as possible. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the proposed amendment to delete the presumption of NOV abatement
represented the ``further rulemaking'' of which the court was advised. However, the Secretary committed only to
reconsider the presumption of NOV abatement. The Secretary never committed to finalize any proposed rule. After
receiving the States' and industry's comments cited above, OSM has determined that the complete deletion of the presumption
would impose a significant burden upon the States and provide little enforcement benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the September, 1991 proposed rule, it was, in fact, never OSM's intention to load NOV's
(other than delinquent NOV civil penalties) into the AVS database, given the large volume of data entry that would
be required to keep such violation information up to date. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, even if OSM had completely deleted the presumption of NOV abatement by adopting the proposed modification to
30 CFR 773.15(b)(1), there would have been no immediate, direct impact upon the AVS database. If OSM had eliminated
the presumption, there would have been, however, a significant indirect impact upon AVS. The States would have been
required to spend scarce resources tracking other States' NOV's, including those whose abatement periods had not
yet expired, for permit application purposes. The States would have had fewer resources available to focus upon the
other information that AVS believes is more critical to the effective implementation of section 510(c) of the Act,
including the development of complete information with respect to entities' ownership and control. Further, OSM
is committed to making its best effort to provide, through the AVS, a complete list of violations which are required
to be used as the basis for a permit block.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSM has determined to retain a presumption of NOV abatement in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The focus of State
regulatory authorities' concern appears to be the uncertainty incident to NOV's with abatement periods which have
not yet expired. In substance, where an NOV has been issued and the abatement period has not yet expired, it is uncertain
whether the violation will be ultimately abated or will ripen into the basis for the issuance of a failure to abate cessation
order. The State regulatory authorities and the coal industry argue that such uncertainty justifies unconditional
permit issuance. The environmentalists argue that such uncertainty demands permit denial. While OSM recognizes
the needs of the State regulatory authorities, OSM believes that environmental advocates have also asserted legitimate
concerns about the consequences of a blanket presumption of abatement for all NOV's. OSM has therefore chosen a middle
ground which will serve to reduce the uncertainty while balancing the concerns of the various interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments made to its proposal, OSM has amended 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to provide that, in the absence
of a failure-to-abate cessation order, a regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation is being corrected
to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation where the abatement period for such notice
of violation has not yet expired and where the permit applicant has provided certification in his or her permit application
that such violation is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the
violation. Where OSM is regulatory authority, OSM will incorporate such certification into the statement of verification
currently required in OSM's permit applications. Any permits issued incident to such certification will be conditionally
issued based upon successful completion of the necessary abatement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above approach balances the concerns of the commenters. A blanket presumption of abatement for all NOV's_including
those whose abatement period has expired_is inappropriate. It is entirely possible that there are NOV's with expired
abatement periods for which cessation orders have not yet been written. To presume that such NOV's are abated is unjustified.
At the same time, today's final rule recognizes that, until the abatement period has expired, diligent operators
should have the opportunity to correct their NOV's in a timely manner without being subjected to permit denial during
the period of abatement if they certify that such violations are in the process of abatement. State regulatory authorities
can conserve limited resources by having the benefit of a reasonable presumption of NOV abatement which applies to
those NOV's which are in a true state of uncertainty with respect to abatement. In considering whether a particular
NOV should be the basis for permit denial, State regulatory authorities will also have the comfort of certification
by the applicant and the protection of conditional issuance to assure that any representations made with respect
to NOV abatement are actually fulfilled.

OSM recognizes that some large companies may not be aware of all NOV's whose abatement periods have not expired where
such NOV's are cited against one or more of their many subsidiaries. Nevertheless, OSM expects that companies will
make a good faith effort to track their NOV's and report such NOV's as part of permit applications. Where a company has
developed a good faith NOV tracking procedure and, in the diligent exercise of such procedure, has inadvertently
failed to report an NOV whose abatement period has not yet expired, such failure would not constitute willful nondisclosure
by the company. On the other hand, where a company fails to set up a tracking procedure or where a company sets up a tracking
procedure or corporate structure designed or intended to shield it from knowledge of NOV's or the ability to track
NOV's this will not excuse a company's failure to accurately report NOV's in permit applications. Further, OSM expects
that any certifications of ongoing correction provided with respect to NOV's be based upon truthful information
and be submitted in good faith. To the extent that a company asserts that it cannot certify because it is not certain
whether all violations have been identified, the presumption of NOV abatement would not apply. OSM recognizes that
companies may assert this argument, but OSM considers the certification necessary to assure that violations are
in the process of being corrected.

As indicated above, the second issue in the proposed rule which generated significant comments was the proposed safe
harbor for the owners or controllers of delinquent civil penalties for violations issued prior to October 3, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters from the coal industry and the States criticized the safe harbor proposal because it required, as a condition
precedent for safe harbor treatment, that reclamation be completed within 120 days after the effective date of the
rule. These commenters asserted that this proposed condition limiting the availability of safe harbor protection
was inadequate and insufficiently flexible. They argued that the proposal did not take into account the time required
to perform reclamation and the potential for reclamation to be effected by changing events and environmental conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, commenters representing the environmental community also criticized the safe harbor provision. These
commenters criticized the proposed $750 settlement amount as arbitrarily and artificially low. Commenters representing
the State regulatory authorities asserted that the proposed penalty amount provided insufficient flexibility
and that a State regulatory authority should be able to demand a greater penalty if the circumstances warrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the industry and the States focused upon the limited window of time available to perform abatement and the environmentalists
and the States questioned the limited penalty amount, all of these commenters seemed to share the view, subject to
their particular and differing perspectives, that the proposed safe harbor provision was artificial and unnecessarily
rigid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of the comments, OSM agrees that the proposal was unnecessarily rigid and has, therefore, not
finalized the safe harbor proposal. Accordingly, regulatory authorities will have the discretion to review the
totality of the facts on a case by case basis to determine whether a person who is linked, through ownership or control,
to delinquent civil penalties may avoid permit block through payment of a portion of such penalties. OSM will review
the adequacy of such settlements within the context of OSM's routine oversight of the State regulatory authorities
under 30 CFR parts 732 and 733 and of case specific complaints and investigations under 30 CFR part 842.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether a settlement is adequate will be a function of the entire context of a particular case. Factors to be considered
include, but are not limited to, whether the settling owner or controller has performed required reclamation to abate
the violations other than the delinquent civil penalties in a timely manner. The regulatory authority should also
consider the degree to which the facts indicate that the owner or controller had the authority to exercise control
of the violator. If the owner or controller had such authority, whether it chose to exercise such authority or not,
it is less credible for the owner or controller to argue that it was unaware of the activities and violations such that
a significant discount in civil penalty amount is warranted for the owner or controller. In substance, with such authority,
the owner or controller would have had the ability to be informed of violations in a timely manner if he or she had wanted
to be so informed. The regulatory authority should also consider the size and solvency of the owner or controller and
the impact that the payment of a reduced amount of the civil penalty will have upon the activities of that company and
other companies similarly situated. Further, the regulatory authority should consider the impact of the settlement
upon the integrity of the regulatory authority's enforcement program. In other words, will the proposed settlement
encourage companies to conclude that there is an economic benefit in ignoring the civil penalties and violations
of their owned or controlled entities until such companies are required to settle by regulatory authorities?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has not adopted the provisions of the proposed rule which would have deleted
the presumption that NOV abatement currently contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) and which would have created a safe
harbor for owners or controllers with respect to delinquent civil penalties for violations cited prior to October
3, 1988. In paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, OSM has inserted language providing for a presumption of NOV abatement
for NOV's whose abatement periods have not yet expired where the permit applicants have certified that such NOV's
are in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. In the
final rule, OSM has also deleted the language contained in the proposed rule which would have provided the safe harbor
for certain owners or controllers. OSM has otherwise adopted the provisions of the proposed rule as the final rule.

Section 773.20_Improvidently Issued Permits: General Procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, OSM proposed to amend paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 30 CFR 773.20 to delete the reference to the presumption
of NOV abatement contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). See Proposed Rule, Use of the Applicant/Violator Computer System
in Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval, 56 FR 45780, 45784&hyph;45785 (September 6, 1991). The basis
for such deletion was to assure consistency with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which were to be similarly amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSM has reinserted language which addresses the situation which occurs when a permit is issued in
reliance upon the presumption that an NOV is being abated in the absence of a cessation order and a cessation order is,
in fact, issued with respect to the violation. In such an event, a regulatory authority is required to find that the
permit has been improvidently issued. The September, 1991, proposed rule deleted this language to assure consistency
with OSM's proposal to delete the presumption of NOV abatement from the permit review process of 30 CFR 773.15(b).
As described in this preamble in the discussion relating to 30 CFR 773.15(b), OSM has decided to include a presumption
of NOV abatement for that regulation. To assure consistency between the treatment of improvidently issued permits
and permit applications, OSM has reinserted language which addresses the presumption of NOV abatement into 30 CFR
773.20(b)(1)(i)(B). The agency's reasons for retaining a presumption of NOV abatement are described fully in the
preamble discussion with respect to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, OSM also proposed to renumber certain provisions of the then current 30 CFR 773.20 such that paragraph
(b)(2) would become (b)(1)(ii), paragraph (b)(2)(i) would become (b)(1)(ii)(A), paragraph (b)(2)(ii) would become
(b)(1)(ii)(B), and paragraph (b)(3) would become (b)(1)(iii). In the final rule, such renumbering is also adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM also proposed to amend the then current 30 CFR 773.20 by inserting a new paragraph (b)(2), which would have made
the provisions of proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of
violations, applicable when a regulatory authority makes determinations with respect to improvidently issued
permits. Proposed &sect;773.26 would have been applicable when a regulatory authority determines whether a violation,
penalty, or fee remains unabated or delinquent, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the
subject of a good faith appeal, and whether any ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible
for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed insertion of the language referring to &sect;773.26 would have had the effect of assuring that the standards,
responsibilities, and procedures created by proposed &sect;773.26 were consistently applied to permit issuance
and to determinations regarding improvident permit issuance. OSM took such an approach in the belief that this would
enhance the fairness of the permitting process and the prospect for the uniform enforcement of nationwide minimum
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, this approach is adopted. The reference to &sect;773.26 is changed, however, to &sect;773.25 to
reflect the renumbering of that section. Also, as has been indicated previously, OSM has inserted language in paragraph
(b)(2) of final &sect;773.20 to clarify that a challenge as to the existence of a violation at the time it was cited may
be made within the context of the improvident permit issuance process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further proposed to renumber provisions of the regulation at 30 CFR 773.20(c), which relate to remedial measures
for improvidently issued permits, so that then current paragraph (c) would become (c)(1), then current paragraph
(c)(1) would become (c)(1)(i), then current paragraph (c)(2) would become (c)(1)(ii), then current paragraph (c)(3)
would become (c)(1)(iii), and then current paragraph (c)(4) would become (c)(1)(iv). In the final rule, such renumbering
is adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, proposed renumbered paragraph (c)(1)(iv), which would authorize the regulatory authority to use rescission
as one of the remedial measures for improvident permit issuance, would have deleted a specific reference contained
in the former 30 CFR 773.20(c)(4) to the rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for such proposed deletion was that OSM sought to establish a prior notice and common appeal procedure for
both permit suspensions and permit rescissions with respect to improvidently issued permits. The then current regulation
governing permit suspensions at 30 CFR 773.20(c)(3) did not impose any specific requirements for prior notice, opportunity
to be heard, or right of appeal for the permittee whose permit is to be suspended. See 54 FR 18450 (1989). In contrast
to this, then current regulations governing permit rescissions at 30 CFR 773.21 contained specific requirements
for prior notice to a permittee and an explicit right of appeal. Accordingly, through its proposed rule, OSM sought
to provide for greater consistency in its procedures governing suspension and rescission of permits. In the final
rule, the proposed change has been adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further proposed to amend 30 CFR 773.20 to add a new paragraph (c)(2) which would have required that a regulatory
authority which decides to suspend a permit must provide at least 30 days' prior written notice to the permittee. The
proposed rule would have provided that, in the event that the regulatory authority decides to rescind a permit, it
would provide notice in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.21. The proposed amendment further provided
that a permittee would be given the opportunity to request administrative review of the notice under proposed OHA
rules 43 CFR 4.1370 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, where OSM is the regulatory authority, or under the State program equivalent, where the State is the regulatory authority.
In the absence of such temporary relief, the regulatory authority's decision would have remained in effect during
the pendency of appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's proposed rule amendments made no change in the requirement contained at 30 CFR 773.20(b) that a regulatory authority
analyze a potentially improvidently issued permit ``[U]nder the violations review criteria of the regulatory program
at the time that the permit was issued.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter representing one of the State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of the proposed rule
which would have required that the regulatory authority provide thirty days' written notice to the permittee, if
the regulatory authority decides to suspend the permit. This commenter asserted that there may be circumstances
which require the immediate suspension and, possibly, outright rescission of a permit. This commenter asserted
that delay, in the interests of due process rights, may not serve the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's concerns. It is entirely conceivable that a permittee could have been issued a permit
even though the permittee was linked, through ownership or control, to a string of unabated violations at the time
of permit issuance. The permittee could have willfully and fraudulently concealed such links through some clever
scheme or artifice at the time of permit application. While AVS has reduced the potential for such a scenario to occur,
it remains possible. Such a permit ought to be subject to immediate suspension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM must weigh the public interest in preventing violators from keeping permits against the public
interest in assuring that permittees' due process rights are protected. The remedies of permit suspension and rescission
are serious. Unlike an applicant who merely has an expectancy in his application to receive a permit to mine, a permittee
has, in fact and as a matter of law, assumed the rights and responsibilities incident to the permit to engage in surface
coal mining operations. Indeed, OSM's regulations provide that a valid permit carries with it the right of successive
renewal. See 30 CFR 774.15(a). Thus, a permittee has an interest which is deserving of a higher level of protection
than the interest of an applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the provisions of 30 CFR 773.21 previously provided for notice to the permittee only prior to a proposed permit
suspension and rescission. Thus, a permittee got prior notice of a suspension only if the suspension was the precursor
to a subsequent rescission. If the regulatory authority did not intend the suspension of a permit to be followed by
the permit's rescission, there was no requirement for prior notice. Also, the provisions of 30 CFR 773.21 provided
appeal rights for a notice of suspension and rescission. There were no similar appeal rights in 30 CFR 773.20 with respect
to suspension. In substance, permit suspension had the potential of being a harsher punishment than permit rescission
by reason of these procedural differences. These were anomalies that OSM wanted to correct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the final version of 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) provides for notice prior to permit suspension; for administrative
review of the notice of suspension under 43 CFR 4.1370 et seq. or under the State program equivalent; for a common appeal
procedure for both permit suspensions and permit rescissions with respect to improvidently issued permits and for
the regulatory authority's decision to remain in effect during the pendency of an appeal, unless temporary relief
has been granted in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1376 or the State program equivalent. States can be more stringent with
respect to providing less prior notice, but they are responsible for the legal consequences of such actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters objected to OSM's assertion of any role in revoking or setting aside improvidently issued permits
based upon the totality of their objections to the AVS, the ownership and control rules, and the proposed rules. These
reasons included the proposed rules' alleged deficiencies with respect to due process, State primacy, dispersion
of authority for permit decisionmaking, and all other objections asserted by industry commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' views, including their view that OSM has no legitimate role in the improvidently
issued permit process. OSM has an essential role to play, both as a regulatory authority and as an agency of the Federal
government overseeing the States' programs. OSM incorporates by reference its previous responses to industry commenters
in this preamble which address the commenters' concerns. Further, in the preamble to the rules governing improvidently
issued permits, OSM has explained the legal basis for the improvidently issued permit rules and the rationale for
OSM's role with respect to the implementation of such rules in relation to the States. See Preamble to 30 CFR 773.20,

Environmentalist commenters criticized the portions of 30 CFR 773.20 which provide that the test for evaluating
whether a permit was improvidently issued is ``the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time
the permit was issued.'' See 30 CFR 773.20(b). These commenters asserted that OSM should clearly spell out the violations
review criteria, rather than rely upon the individual regulatory programs' criteria at the time of permit issuance
as the applicable standards. These commenters criticized the provisions of OSM's regulations as being contrary
to the Act and cited in support portions of their brief filed in the case of

OSM disagrees with the commenters' position. As indicated above, OSM's proposed rule did not propose substantive
changes to this provision of the regulation. In the preamble to the improvidently issued permit rules cited above,
OSM explained its rationale for using the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit
was issued as the standard for improvident issuance. See Preamble to 30 CFR 773.20, 773.21, and 843.21; Final Rule,

, No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C.), environmental advocates advanced similar arguments with respect to the agency's improvidently
issued permit rules and the provisions of the rules applying the violations review criteria of the regulatory program
at the time of permit issuance. In the briefs submitted by the Department of the Interior in those cases, the Department
analyzed relevant statutory language and legislative history and carefully explained why the environmental advocates'
criticisms were not well taken. Copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking.
OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department in those briefs herein by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental commenters also criticized other portions of 30 CFR 773.20 for which OSM did not propose any substantive
amendments as part of the September, 1991, proposed rules. The commenters asserted that OSM should clarify that the
remedial measures available to a regulatory authority to cure an improvidently issued permit require that the regulatory
authority impose both an abatement plan and a permit condition incorporating such plan before an improvidently issued
permit is considered resolved. They asserted that the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20(c) inappropriately allow the regulatory
authority to choose whether to require a permit condition or an abatement plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters that a rule amendment is needed. The provisions of the regulation require that the
regulatory authority ``use one or more'' of the listed remedial measures including requiring the implementation
of an abatement agreement; conditioning the permit upon abatement of outstanding violations within a reasonable
period of time; suspension of the permit; or rescission of the permit. This provision affords the regulatory authority
the opportunity to exercise discretion, in light of the circumstances, to make a reasoned choice as to the appropriate
remedy. In the preamble to the improvidently issued permit rule, OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This section *&blank;*&blank;* includes four alternative remedial measures because of the diversity of circumstances
under which a regulatory authority might find that a permit was improvidently issued, and the resulting need to apply
a remedy that not only is administratively appropriate, but also is fair and equitable to the permittee *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSMRE believes that the term [``improvidently issued''] reflects the severity of the problem involved when a regulatory
authority should not have issued a permit, while at the same time not foreclosing reasonable flexibility in the adoption
of appropriate remedial measures *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[T]he rule affords the regulatory authority reasonable discretion to consider the circumstances involving a particular
improvidently issued permit and to fashion an appropriate remedy *&blank;*&blank;*.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the rule does not require a regulatory authority to use any particular one of the four remedial measures,
OSMRE intends that the measure or measures used will be commensurate with the circumstances under which a permit was
improvidently issued.

 54 FR 18438, 18447&hyph;18448 (April 28, 1989). Certainly, it could be reasonable, depending upon particular circumstances,
for a regulatory authority to require both a plan of abatement and a permit condition implementing such plan. The agency
has previously rejected the view, however, that there is only one correct option or options from the alternative remedies
provided in the improvidently issued permit rule which is or are appropriate for all circumstances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the regulation afford the regulatory authority the opportunity to tailor a remedy ``package''
appropriate for the particular circumstances under which a permit was improvidently issued. The goals of any such
remedy are ``to correct the defect in the permit and achieve a state of compliance.''

at 18447. If either a permit condition or an abatement agreement could reasonably be expected to accomplish these
goals under the circumstances, then either would be sufficient to resolve the improvidently issued permit. In the
event that it becomes apparent that selected remedial measures are not effective, each of the remedies affords leverage
to the regulatory authority to compel compliance. Such choices are appropriately made by the regulatory authority,
subject to OSM's oversight under 30 CFR 843.21. At this time, OSM sees no reason to amend the regulation to routinely
require the use of both remedies in all circumstances where abatement of a violation is to be undertaken as a necessary
part of the resolution of an improvidently issued permit.

Section 773.21_Improvidently issued permits: Rescission procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, OSM proposed to amend the then current regulation at 30 CFR 773.21(a) to make the provisions of
proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, applicable
when a regulatory authority invokes the automatic suspension and rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. The rationale
for such amendment is the same as that discussed above with respect to similar language contained in &sect;773.20.
In substance, that was to assure that the standards, responsibilities, and procedures created by proposed &sect;773.26
were consistently applied to permit issuance and to determinations regarding improvident permit issuance. OSM
proposed such an approach in the belief that this would enhance the fairness of the permitting process and the prospect
for the uniform enforcement of nationwide minimum standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM proposed to delete paragraph (c) of then current 30 CFR 773.21 which provided for appeals of rescission
notices. Under the proposal, rescission appeal procedures were to be incorporated in 30 CFR 773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter representing a State regulatory authority asserted that the States typically have provisions for
the administrative review of a regulatory authority's decision to suspend or rescind a permit. Accordingly, this
commenter questioned why OSM's proposed rules needed to include provisions for the appeals of permit rescissions
due to improvidently issued permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for providing appeal procedures for permit rescissions incident to improvidently issued permits
is essentially the same as the rationale for providing appeal procedures for permit suspensions. In substance, a
permittee has, in fact and as a matter of law, assumed the rights and responsibilities incident to the permit to engage
in surface coal mining operations. Indeed, OSM's regulation provides that a valid permit carries with it the right
of successive renewal. See 30 CFR 774.15(a). Thus, a permittee has an interest which is deserving of protection. Thus,
a permittee whose permit has been rescinded is entitled to a review of the decision to rescind.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the proposed amendment of September, 1991, then current 30 CFR 773.21 provided notice and appeal rights with
respect to permit rescission incident to improvidently issued permits. By proposing to amend this rule to achieve
a common set of procedural protections for permit suspensions and permit rescissions incident to improvidently
issued permits, it was not OSM's intention to reduce the appellate rights previously provided by 30 CFR 773.21 or comparable
State provisions. Instead, OSM wanted to assure that procedures of review were available for both permit suspensions
and permit rescissions. The absence of such procedures for suspensions was a matter which OSM sought to address.

To the extent that State programs already have adequate appeals and notice procedures with respect to permit rescissions
incident to improvidently issued permits, OSM believes that the proposed rules should impose little, if any, additional
burden upon such States. Under the Act, OSM's responsibility is to establish minimum national standards which approved
State programs are required to meet. Accordingly, individual State programs may exceed OSM's standards. A State
which has such provisions may respond to any 732 letters OSM sends as a result of this rule by affirming that the State
already interprets its program consistent with this Federal provision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the above reasons, the commenter's position is rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has decided to adopt the proposed changes as part of the final rules. In adopting the proposal, OSM has modified
the provisions at paragraph (a) of 30 CFR 773.21 to make the provisions of &sect;773.25, standards for challenging
ownership or control links and the status of violation, applicable when a regulatory authority invokes the automatic
suspension and rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. The proposed rule contained a reference to &sect;773.26.
This change reflects that proposed &sect;773.26 has been renumbered as final &sect;773.25. OSM has made an additional
non-substantive change to the introductory paragraph of &sect;773.21 to reflect that &sect;773.20(c)(4) has been
renumbered to be &sect;773.20(c)(1)(iv). Further, OSM deletes former paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 773.21 which provides
for appeals of rescission notices. As discussed above, rescission appeal procedures are incorporated in 30 CFR 773.20.

Section 773.22_Verification of ownership or control application information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSM proposed &sect;773.22 to mandate an inquiry whose focus was to assure that the regulatory authority develops
complete and accurate information as to the identification of the applicant and all owners or controllers of the applicant
prior to making a determination on a permit application. Accordingly, the proposed section focused on verification
of ownership or control application information. Such accurate and complete information would enable the regulatory
authority to make an informed decision as to whether the applicant was linked to a surface coal mining and reclamation
operation in violation of the Act or of any other environmental laws within the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.22 would have imposed a duty upon a regulatory authority to review the information
provided in the permit application, pursuant to 30 CFR 778.13(c) and 778.13(d), to determine whether the information
provided, including the identification of the operator and all owners and controllers of the operator, was complete
and accurate. In making such determination, the regulatory authority would have been required to compare information
provided in the application with information contained in manual and automated data sources. Manual sources for
review would have included the regulatory authority's own enforcement and inspection records and State corporation
commission or tax records, to the extent they contain information concerning ownership or control links. Automated
data sources would have included the regulatory authority's own computer systems, if any, and the AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.22 would have provided that, if it appeared from information provided in the
application pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;778.13 that none of the persons identified in the application
had had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority would have been required to inquire of the applicant
whether anyone other than those persons identified in the application would own or control the mining operation as
either an operator or as another type of owner or controller.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule assumed that, given the complexity of modern coal mining operations, it was likely that most applicants
would have at least someone in an ownership or control capacity who had had previous mining experience. If it appeared
from the face of an application that that was not the case, the regulatory authority would have been required to contact
the applicant to verify that the applicant had not omitted from the application an operator or other owner or controller
who had such experience. The intent of this proposal was to ensure that the regulatory authority obtains information
on other, experienced persons who may actually be running the operation and should therefore have been disclosed
as part of the ownership and control data in a permit application, but were not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.22 provided that if, after conducting the information review described above,
the regulatory authority identified any potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency in the ownership or control
information provided in the application, it would be required to contact the applicant prior to making a final determination
with respect to the application. The applicant would then be required to resolve the potential omission, inaccuracy,
or inconsistency through submission of an amendment to the application or a satisfactory explanation which includes
credible information sufficient to demonstrate that no actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency existed.
The regulatory authority was also required to take action in accordance with the provisions of proposed &sect;843.23,
sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information, or the State
program equivalent, where appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.22 would have required that, upon completion of the information review mandated
by &sect;773.22, the regulatory authority promptly enter all ownership or control information into AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters objected to the provision of the proposed rule requiring that the regulatory authority compare
information provided in the permit application with sources such as State corporation commission or tax records.
They asserted that such records are typically updated only on an annual basis and may be obviously inaccurate. They
further asserted that requiring the applicant to explain discrepancies between information contained in the application
and the State corporation commission or tax records will lead to inappropriate delays in the permit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' criticisms of the proposed requirement. The proposed requirement was designed
to assure that the regulatory authority reviewing an application has complete ownership and control information.
Such information is necessary to enable the regulatory authority to determine whether the application should be
issued in accordance with the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unfortunately, a regulatory authority cannot simply rely upon all applicants to supply complete ownership or control
information. Some applicants may err in good faith, others may conceal information knowingly. Accordingly, the
regulatory authority must look to other sources of information. The information contained in the records of State
corporation commissions or taxing authorities is a good potential source of ownership or control information. Depending
upon particular State requirements, such information may have been submitted under oath. Further, such information
is submitted subject to the review of State corporation commissions and State taxing authorities. Thus, a State regulatory
authority reviewing such information has the benefit of any efforts made by these other agencies to assure that information
submitted to them is accurate and complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, such information is important because it provides a basis for inquiry and for comparison with information
submitted in the permit application. If there are discrepancies between the ownership or control information in
such records and that submitted in the permit application, the applicant should be able to readily explain such discrepancies.
Thus, if any information previously submitted to State taxing authorities or corporation commission has become
subsequently outdated, this can be explained with minimal inconvenience to an applicant and minimal delay in the
permit application process. On the other hand, if important ownership or control information has been omitted from
a permit application, the State taxing and corporation commission records may be the key to identifying such omissions.
In any event, the benefits of such information to the regulatory authority outweigh the risks identified by the industry
commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities also asserted that these records rarely provide information
not contained in previous permit applications or in AVS. This commenter also indicated that these records are difficult
to obtain because tax records are not typically available for review by State agencies other than the taxing authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the view that these types of records merely contain information which is duplicative of information
already available to the State regulatory authorities through permit applications or AVS. While OSM makes every
effort to assure that AVS contains complete and accurate information with respect to ownership or control links,
OSM has never asserted that AVS is perfect. Even if AVS were a perfectly complete source of such information, new corporations
are being formed and new applications to conduct surface coal mining operations are submitted. AVS must be regularly
updated. It is likely that there is relevant ownership or control information contained in corporation commission
and tax records of the various States which is not yet reflected on AVS. Thus, there is a need for State regulatory authorities
to review such information and compare such information with permit applications to identify accurate and complete
ownership or control information. Such information can then be added to the AVS database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to commenter's concern about the availability of State tax and corporation commission records, OSM
recognizes that particular State laws may limit a State regulatory authority's access to such records. The requirement
of the proposed regulation was for the regulatory authority to review ``reasonably available sources.'' Thus, if
a State law explicitly forbids the regulatory authority's access to State tax information, the information would
not be ``reasonably available'' for review. In the absence of such explicit prohibition, however, State regulatory
authorities should review such information. OSM encourages State regulatory authorities to work with their sister
tax and corporation commission agencies to develop information access arrangements to the extent permissible under
applicable laws. Nevertheless, OSM rejects the view that the difficulty of obtaining the information justifies
withdrawing or amending the proposing regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter representing State regulatory authorities further questioned the requirement contained in paragraph
(c)(2) of proposed &sect;773.22 that ``credible information,'' rather that ``credible evidence,'' support an
applicant's satisfactory explanation of omissions, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies with respect to ownership
or control information in an application. OSM used the term ``credible information,'' rather than ``credible evidence''
because this is a broader concept than credible evidence. This term would include credible evidence which would be
admissible at trial. Nevertheless, an applicant might be able to provide a satisfactory explanation based upon information
which would not necessarily be admissible at trial, but which is a reliable and believable basis to conclude that no
actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency exists. Accordingly, the language of the proposed regulation was
intended to provide flexibility to the regulatory authority to consider such information, including credible evidence.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule at &sect;773.22 as a final rule with minor modifications which are now
described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, paragraph (b) of the proposed rule would have required that, if it appeared from information provided
in the application pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;778.13, that none of the persons identified in the application
had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority had to inquire of the applicant whether anyone other
than those persons identified in the application would own or control the mining operation as either an operator or
as another type of owner or controller. The final rule imposes the duty upon the regulatory authority to both inquire
of the applicant and to investigate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, there may have been an implication that the regulatory authority could simply conclude its inquiry
in reliance upon the applicant's explanation. Such an implication was not intended. Accordingly, OSM has added explicit
language to paragraph (b) of final &sect;773.22 to insure that, if none of the persons identified in the permit application
has had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority will not simply rely upon the applicant's explanations.
Instead, the regulatory authority will go forward to investigate whether any persons other than those identified
in the application will conduct the mining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final version of &sect;773.22, OSM has retained language from paragraph (c) of the proposed &sect;773.22 requiring
the regulatory authority to take action in accordance with the provisions of &sect;843.23 or the State program equivalent.
However, OSM has deferred action on the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 for a later rulemaking. See 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(June 28, 1993). The reference to that rule has been left in final &sect;773.22 in the event that a final version of &sect;843.23
is adopted. The inclusion of such reference, however, does not prejudge whether OSM will ultimately adopt such a rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, paragraph (d) of the proposed rule would have required that, upon completion of the information
review mandated by &sect;773.22, the regulatory authority promptly enter all ownership or control information
into AVS. OSM has adopted the final version of this paragraph to require that, upon completion of its review, the regulatory
authority enter ownership or control information ``into'' AVS. If such information is already on the system, the
regulatory authority is required to ``update'' such information. Such changes have been made to provide better clarity
to the rule language.

Section 773.23_Review of Ownership or Control and Violation Information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM proposed &sect;773.23 as a new section which would delineate the regulatory authority's review obligations
with respect to a permit application after the regulatory authority had completed the process of verifying ownership
or control application information as described in &sect;773.22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required the regulatory authority to review
all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the
applicant to determine whether the application could be approved under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). With respect
to ownership or control links involving the applicant, such information would have included all information obtained
under 30 CFR 773.22 and 778.13. With respect to violation notices, such information would have included all information
obtained under &sect;778.14, information obtained from OSM, including information shown in the AVS, and information
obtained from the regulatory authority's own records concerning violation notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, the proposed regulation was designed to assure that the regulatory authority considers complete ownership,
control, and violation information in making the decision required by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) with respect to a permit
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.23 were proposed to provide the course of action which a regulatory
authority would be required to take if the review conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of the section disclosed any
ownership or control link between the applicant and any person cited in a violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required that the regulatory authority notify the applicant
of such link and refer the applicant to the agency with jurisdiction over the violation notice.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required that the regulatory authority not approve the permit
application unless and until it determined that all ownership or control links between the applicant and any person
cited in a violation notice were erroneous or had been rebutted, or the regulatory authority determined that the violation
to which the applicant had been linked had been corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject
of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) or the State program equivalent. The determinations
to be made by the regulatory authority under paragraph (b)(2) of the proposed regulation were to have been made in accordance
with the provisions of proposed &sect;773.24, procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS,
and proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, or
their State program equivalents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required that, following the regulatory authority's decision
on the application or following the applicant's withdrawal of the application, the regulatory authority be required
to promptly enter all relevant information related to the decision or withdrawal into AVS. The regulatory authority's
decision could have included unconditional issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of the permit. The requirement
that all relevant information be promptly entered into AVS was intended to insure that AVS was continually updated
to reflect the most current information available with respect to permit applicants. A critical source of such information
would be the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing members of the coal industry criticized the provisions of the proposed regulation as being
unnecessarily duplicative of the provisions of proposed &sect;773.22 and of 30 CFR 773.15(b). In support of this
position, they pointed to the provisions of the proposed regulation which require the review of violation information
and ownership or control links to determine whether an application could be approved. They questioned why the requirements
of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 would be imposed as two separate stages, rather than as a single stage of
the permit application process under 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the view that the provisions of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 are duplicative or redundant
to each other or with respect to the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Further, OSM does not believe that these provisions
should be consolidated with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While each of the regulatory sections at issue are part of the permit application and review process, the two proposed
&sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 represent separate tasks for the regulatory authority. In implementing the provisions
of proposed &sect;773.22, the regulatory authority would be focusing upon information contained in the permit application
and attempting to verify such information by comparing it with other readily available sources of information. The
purpose of such activity is to identify complete and accurate information with respect to the application, including
identification of the person or persons who will own or control the surface coal mining operation. In implementing
the provisions of proposed &sect; 773.23, the regulatory authority takes the information gleaned from its research
on the application and then evaluates whether there are any ownership or control links between the applicant and any
person cited in a violation notice. In this stage, the focus of inquiry is to determine whether the permit can be approved
in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While both of these stages involve the use of AVS, this does not mean that such stages are redundant or duplicative.
The AVS should be consulted throughout the permit application process to assure that the regulatory authority has
the most current ownership or control and violation information available from OSM and other State regulatory authorities.
The AVS is an evolving information system which is routinely supplemented with new information. The use of AVS in the
earlier stage, proposed &sect;773.22, provides an information resource for comparison with application ownership
or control information and a basis for inquiry with the applicant. During the later stage, proposed &sect;773.23,
the regulatory authority takes previously developed ownership or control information and compares such information
with outstanding violation information in deciding whether or not to issue the permit. The use of AVS in this stage
enables the regulatory authority to have the benefit of any information which may have been subsequently added to
AVS by OSM or other State regulatory authorities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, neither of the provisions of proposed sections are redundant with 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The provisions of
30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) do not delineate the means by which a regulatory authority may comply with the mandates of section
510(c) of the Act or 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 fill this need. These proposed sections
provide the specific steps to be taken by a regulatory authority to achieve compliance with the provisions of 30 CFR
773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One industry commenter suggested that all of these provisions should be consolidated into a single violations review
provision. While this is a reasonable alternative, OSM is convinced that the approach contained in the proposed rules
is a better alternative. The placement of the required tasks in separate sections of the regulations, with appropriate
cross references, better highlights the particular duties necessary at each stage of the permit application review
process in a way which is more likely to support compliance. Also, as the above discussion demonstrates, the tasks
are sufficiently separable that they lend themselves to separate regulatory sections. Such separation, however,
does not mean that there must be unnecessary delays. A regulatory authority can move forward methodically through
each required task in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of proposed
&sect;773.23 because such provision would prohibit the issuance of a permit if there are outstanding violations.
He asserted that these provisions would significantly increase the burden on applicants, because the provisions
did not incorporate the presumption that an NOV is considered abated unless an FTACO has been issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this preamble, OSM has already addressed the matter of the presumption of NOV abatement within the discussion of
the amendments to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which have been adopted today. As indicated, OSM has determined to retain a presumption
of NOV abatement where the abatement period for the NOV has not expired and the applicant has provided certification
that the violation is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the
violation. Since the provisions of proposed &sect;773.23 incorporate the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1), such
presumption would be similarly applied as part of proposed &sect;773.23. Thus, the substance of commenter's concern
has been addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups urged that paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.23 be clarified
with respect to the regulatory authority's duty to review the accuracy of ownership or control information. They
pointed out that there are many additional sources of ownership or control information beyond those listed in the
regulation which a regulatory authority could review. They asserted that the regulatory authority should be required
to review the sources listed in the regulation, the AVS and the regulatory authority's own records, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at a minimum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees that there are many potential sources of ownership or control information and that the sources for review
listed in the proposed regulation are those which the regulatory authority should be required to review, at a minimum.
OSM disagrees, however, that the proposed regulation needs to be further clarified or modified. There is already
language in the proposed regulation which meets the substance of commenters' concerns. In paragraph (a) of proposed
&sect;773.23, the regulatory authority is required to ``review all reasonably available information 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis
added.) In addition, the language makes clear that ``[s]uch information shall include'' the listed items which follow
in
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
 paragraphs (a)(1&hyph;2) of the proposed regulation. The clear meaning of this proposed language is that the listed
examples are those sources which the regulatory authority must review. In addition, the regulatory authority can
choose to review other sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups also urged OSM to incorporate standards to demonstrate
whether an outstanding violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of
the agency with jurisdiction over such violation. OSM believes that the regulatory authority which issued the violation
can effectively define the status of such violation with additional standards. This regulatory authority is well
positioned to determine whether the violation which it has issued has been abated or is in the process of being abated
to its satisfaction. A regulatory authority before which a permit application is pending should consult the regulatory
authority which issued the violation to ascertain the status of any violation to which an applicant has been linked
through ownership or control.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule as a final rule with a small modification which is now described. In adopting
the proposal, OSM has modified the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of section 773.23 to make the provisions of &sect;&sect;773.25,
standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, along with those contained in
&sect;773.24, applicable when a regulatory authority makes a determination whether to approve a permit. The proposed
rule contained a reference to proposed section 773.26. This change reflects that proposed section 773.26 has been
renumbered as final &sect;773.25. The rule is otherwise adopted as proposed.

Section 773.24_Procedures for Challenging Ownership or Control Links Shown in AVS.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSM proposed &sect;773.24 to establish the procedures to be followed in the event that the AVS showed an ownership
or control link between a person and any person cited in a violation notice. The proposed section would have provided
procedures for direct appeals of such links to OSM by persons who had been so linked. The proposed section would also
have provided for challenges concerning the status of violations to which persons shown on AVS had been linked. The
proposed section would have further provided the opportunity for those persons making a challenge to have obtained
temporary relief from any adverse use of the challenged link or violation information during the pendency of such
challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS in an ownership
or control link to any person cited in a Federal or State violation could have challenged such a link in accordance with
the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of proposed &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the provisions of proposed
&sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations. Paragraph (a)(1)
of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided, however, that such challenge would not be available if the challenger
was bound by a prior administrative or judicial decision with respect to the link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that challenges of ownership or control
links shown on AVS be made before OSM. The theory of the proposed regulation was that, once information with respect
to particular ownership or control links has become part of the AVS and accessible to regulatory authorities across
the country, the responsibility for the maintenance of such information would be a Federal responsibility. Accordingly,
the process for challenging such information would be a Federal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS in an ownership
or control link to a person cited in a Federal violation notice would have challenged the status of such violation in
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of proposed &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the
provisions of proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations.
The procedures applicable would have been similar to those described in paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided, in language similar to that contained in paragraph
(a)(1) of the proposed regulation, that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation would not be available
to any person who was bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning the status of the violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``status of the violation'' would have meant whether the violation remained outstanding, had been corrected,
was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject of a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal
to contest the validity of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i)-(ii). This usage was to have been carried forward
into the provisions of proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status
of violations. Further, the provisions of proposed &sect;773.26 would have limited challenges make to the status
of violations under proposed &sect;773.24 to prevent challenges of the existence of the violation at the time that
it was cited. Again, the process for challenging the status of a Federal violation was to have been a Federal process.
Challenges would have been made before OSM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that any applicant or person shown in AVS to have been
linked by ownership or control to a person cited in a State violation notice could challenge the status of such violation
before the State that issued the violation notice. Such challenge would have to have been made in accordance with that
State's program equivalents to paragraphs (b) through (d) of proposed &sect;773.24 and proposed &sect;773.26.
Again, the provisions of proposed section 773.26 would have been incorporated under proposed &sect;773.24 to prevent
challenges as to the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided, in language similar to that contained in paragraph
(a)(2) of the proposed regulation, that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation before a State program
would not be available to any person who was bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning
the status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that a person seeking to challenge ownership or control
links shown in AVS or the status of Federal violations submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or her
challenge and provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. The proposed regulation would
have required that such information be submitted to the Chief of OSM's AVS Office in Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that OSM make a written determination with respect to
the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the violation. The proposal required that, if an
ownership or control link had been challenged, OSM would then determine whether the link had been shown to be erroneous
or had been rebutted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that, if OSM had determined that the ownership or control
link had been shown to be erroneous or had been rebutted and/or that the violation covered by the violation notice had
been corrected, appropriately appealed, or otherwise resolved within the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) (i)&hyph;(ii),
OSM would be required to have provided notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging
the link or the status of the violation. Under the proposed regulation, if an application was pending, OSM would also
have to notify the regulatory authority before which the application was pending. Further, OSM would have been required
to correct information contained in AVS to reflect the determination which had been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that, if OSM had determined that the challenged ownership
or control link had not been shown to be erroneous and had not been rebutted, and that the violation remained outstanding,
OSM would have been required to provide notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging
the link or the status of the violation. Under the proposed regulation, if an application was pending, OSM would have
also been required to notify the regulatory authority before whom the application was pending. Further, OSM would
have been required to update information contained in AVS, if necessary, to reflect OSM's determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that OSM be required to serve a copy of its decision
with respect to a challenge upon the applicant or other challenger by U.S. certified mail or by any other means consistent
with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that the applicant or other challenger could
have appealed OSM's decision to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within 30 days
of such decision in accordance with proposed OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

was granted in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have further provided for temporary relief from OSM's decision,
if OHA granted such relief in accordance with proposed OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. Under the proposed regulation,
OSM's decision would have remained in effect during the pendency of appeal, unless temporary relief was granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing the coal industry took exception to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of the proposed section
which would preclude an applicant or other person from challenging the status of a violation if he or she was ``bound
by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning'' the status of the violation. The commenters asserted
that determining whether a person was ``bound'' by a prior determination was vague and susceptible to conflicting
interpretations. They further asserted that if, by this proposed language, OSM intended to apply the doctrines of
res judicata or collateral estoppel, there was no need to include such language in the proposed regulation, since
these doctrines would be available as legal defenses to OSM in any event. The commenters indicated that their objection
to this language also applied to the other portions of the proposed regulations where similar language imposing such
a limit on challenges was incorporated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' characterization of the rule language. The proposed rule language is clear in
standing for the principle that a person is entitled to his or her challenge opportunity before an administrative
or judicial tribunal. Nevertheless, a person is not entitled to the multiple relitigation of issues which he or she
has already litigated to conclusion. Accordingly, the proposed rule is explicit in requiring that a person who is
bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination with respect to the status of a violation may not relitigate
such issue. In determining whether a person is bound by a prior determination, traditional principles of res judicata
and collateral estoppel will apply. Contrary to commenters' view, however, it is insufficient to assume that such
principles will apply as a matter of law and that there is no need to provide an explicit limitation in the regulation.
Such a limitation is necessary to eliminate any ambiguity in the regulation with respect to this issue and to assure
that judicial and administrative tribunals are not clogged with duplicative, repetitive claims by persons who have
already litigated such claims. The limiting language provides a clear statement of OSM's intent and will be adopted
as part of the final rule. Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups indicated approval of the provisions
of the proposed regulation which would have limited challenges of the existence of the violation at the time it was
cited. Such commenters did indicate concern, however, that the proposed regulation did not provide an explicit time
limit for OSM to make its decision with respect to a challenge. They urged that the regulation incorporate an explicit
time limit of 30 days for OSM to make a decision to avoid undue delay with respect to the permit application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the view that the regulation needs to contain an explicit time limit for the agency to make a decision
with respect to challenges of ownership or control links or the status of violations. While OSM makes every effort
to decide these issues in an expeditious manner, the review and determination of an ownership or control link can be
a complex endeavor, requiring the review of significant amounts of complex documentary material. Such a process
typically involves a dialogue involving the exchange of numerous documents and testimony between the agency and
the challenger. Such issues may require extensive research and investigation by trained specialists. The imposition
of artificial time limits on the process could create a risk that decisions will be inaccurate and that investigations
will be incomplete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, there is no risk to the environment during the period of challenge. During the period of challenge, the permit
is not issued. Once a presumption of ownership or control has been established pursuant to 30 CFR 773.5 and such presumption
is shown on AVS, the burden is upon an applicant to rebut the presumption. The regulatory authority should not issue
the permit until the presumption has been rebutted. While an expeditious process is encouraged, the regulatory authority
should not be rushed in making such a decision. It should conduct a thorough investigation and review all of the relevant
evidence presented. Some challenges can be resolved within 30 days. Other challenges may require six months. Imposing
an absolute time limit disregards the differences that particular cases have with respect to factual and legal complexity.
Accordingly, OSM must reject the commenters' suggestion that a time limit should be incorporated into the proposed
regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of proposed &sect;773.24 which
would require that challenges of ownership or control links shown on AVS be heard before OSM. In substance, the commenter
was concerned that, for such challenges to be meaningfully addressed, OSM would need copies of supporting documentation
from the States and challengers would be referred to the States to review various documents with respect to ownership
or control relationships and with respect to violations. The commenter asserted that the States would have an ``unnecessary
burden'' to provide duplicate copies of documents to OSM and other participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While OSM appreciates commenter's concern, OSM disagrees that the process provided in the proposed rule will impose
an unnecessary burden upon the States. Under the proposed regulation, OSM is assuming the responsibility to entertain
challenges to ownership or control information shown on AVS. In the absence of OSM's assumption of such responsibility,
the States would have to hear such challenges. Further, regardless of which party assumes responsibility for addressing
such challenges, that party would have to obtain complete documentation from all other parties which might have relevant
records. Thus, each State would have to provide copies of essential documentation to the participants and to whichever
regulatory authority was reviewing the case, be it OSM or a specific State, to enable the challenges to be fairly considered
and resolved. It is in the interests of all concerned with the process_including OSM, the States, the challengers,
and the public_that determinations of such challenges are based upon a complete administrative record. OSM is confident
that the cooperative relationship between OSM and the States which has characterized the development and implementation
of AVS would be carried forward with respect to challenges of ownership or control information on AVS made before OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing State regulatory authorities also questioned whether proposed &sect;773.24 was inconsistent
with other provisions of the proposed rules which would allocate responsibility to State regulatory authorities
to make ownership or control decisions. In support of these positions, the commenters cited the provisions of proposed
&sect;773.26(b) which they considered to be inconsistent with proposed &sect;773.24. As is noted elsewhere in this
preamble, proposed &sect;773.26 is being modified, renumbered, and adopted today as final &sect;773.25. The commenters
were concerned that there would be confusion in the permit application process if OSM would be the deciding agency
with respect to ownership or control information on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. The provisions of proposed &sect;773.24 were designed to avoid confusion.
In substance, the proposed rule would provide challengers with a single forum, OSM, before which they could contest
ownership or control information shown on AVS. The alternative to the proposed rule's approach would be for challengers
to challenge ownership or control links shown on AVS before the various States. There is a greater likelihood of inconsistent
results with multiple jurisdictions making such decisions as opposed to a single agency making such decisions. Further,
the content of AVS would be subject to such inconsistency, since the resolution of challenges would have to be reflected
in the AVS database. Given that AVS is a national database which is used across State lines, there is a need for consistency
in the decisionmaking which forms the content of AVS. Moreover, the approach provided in proposed &sect;773.24 is
consistent with that provided in proposed &sect;773.26(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 would provide that the regulatory authority before which an application
is pending has authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the applicant. Paragraph
(b)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would provide that the regulatory authority that issued a permit would have
authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee. As will be discussed below
in detail, OSM's final regulation adopted as final &sect;773.25 modifies this language to refer to ownership or control
of applications, permits, and violations, rather than ownership or control of applicants, permittees, and violators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.26, the authority of the regulatory authority is initial authority, subject
to OSM's oversight. Under that paragraph of proposed &sect;773.26, a regulatory authority would analyze the facts
and make an initial decision with respect to the ownership or control links of an applicant or a permittee. Such decision
would be subject to OSM's oversight. Then, the regulatory authority would enter such information into AVS, to the
extent necessary to update the system. The entry of such information into AVS would also be subject to OSM's oversight.
Since OSM has ultimate authority, through the exercise of oversight, as to the content of the ownership or control
information on AVS, it is consistent for OSM to be the single forum for the challenge of ownership or control information
shown on AVS as provided by proposed &sect;773.24. If OSM later amends the AVS to reflect a different conclusion with
respect to a particular ownership or control link than that reached by a State regulatory authority, that reflects
OSM's exercise of its oversight authority and its responsibility for the ownership or control information contained
in AVS. If a regulatory authority would then consider a subsequent application, it would be required to review AVS
and to factor the information shown in AVS, as amended by OSM, into the regulatory authority's decision with respect
to the later permit application. Thus, proposed &sect;&sect;773.24 and 773.26 are consistent with each other and
will not lead to confusion in the permit application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities also proposed a revision of proposed &sect;773.24 such that
OSM's decisions made under the proposed regulation would be considered preliminary decisions which would become
final within 30 days thereafter if the person challenging the link could show no valid reason why the decision should
not become final. The commenter asserted that such a provision would enable the challenger to provide supplemental
information which could lead to a corrected final decision and, thus, obviate the need for an appeal to OHA.

OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion. OSM believes, however, that persons should have the opportunity to
seek review of the agency's decision by OHA as soon as possible upon the agency's determination that they are linked,
through ownership or control, to violations. In the absence of a final agency decision, such review by OHA would not
be routinely available. Accordingly, the proposed regulation provides for a final agency decision which may then
be appealed to OHA by a challenger. If a challenger has new information which would lead OHA to conclude that the challenger
is likely to win a reversal of OSM's decision, then such information would support temporary relief with respect to
the decision. On the other hand, where OSM has reviewed information submitted and concluded that an ownership or control
link has been severed, OSM may choose to reserve the right to reopen such decision in the event that new information
or evidence comes to light subsequently. Such reservation of the right to reopen by the agency would be necessary to
assure that the agency can correct its mistakes and assure the accuracy of the AVS. Thus, OSM can supplement the record
with information discovered subsequent to any decision. Accordingly, OSM has determined not to adopt the commenter's
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has decided to adopt a final version of &sect;773.24 which is substantively
similar to the proposed version. OSM has, however, made some minor modifications to the proposed rule which are now
described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (a)(1) of the proposed rule, the rule provided for the challenge of links by persons linked to any person
cited in a Federal or State violation notice. At the time that this proposal was published in September, 1991, OSM expected
that most challenges would be by persons seeking to challenge links to violators to avoid permit blocks. In actuality,
members of the regulated community have also routinely come before OSM seeking to challenge ownership or control
links to persons who are not violators. The language of the proposal did not reflect this reality and was, therefore,
too narrow. Further, the language was potentially inconsistent with language contained in the 1988 preamble to OSM's
ownership and control rules. In that preamble, OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows:

See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final
Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38879 (October 3, 1988). Accordingly, the final rule broadens the proposed language to provide
that ``[a]ny applicant or other person shown in AVS in an ownership or control link to any person may challenge such
link'' even if the link is to persons who are not violators. OSM intends to protect due process rights and provide an
efficient avenue to challenge information shown on AVS. The substance of paragraph (a)(1) of the rule proposed in
September, 1991 is otherwise retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;773.24 has been further modified to delete references in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) to proposed
&sect;773.26 and substitute references to final &sect;773.25 in the place of the deleted section references. This
reflects OSM's renumbering of the sections of the proposed rule. No substantive change in the rule has been made by
such modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that a person seeking to challenge ownership or control
links or the status of Federal violations submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or her challenge and
provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. Proposed paragraph (b) did not explicitly state
that the process of challenge described in this paragraph applied to links 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
shown in AVS. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That was OSM's intent, however, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule. Accordingly, OSM has corrected the
oversight in the rule language by explicitly incorporating this language into this final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.24 has been adopted as proposed. This provision requires OSM to make a written
determination with respect to the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the violation. The
provision of the rule requires that, if an ownership or control link is challenged, OSM then determines whether the
link has been shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted. While no change has been made to the proposed rule, OSM believes
that the following explanation will be helpful in clarifying the operation of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the rule, a determination that a link is ``erroneous'' means that the facts in the case show that no ownership
or control relationship set forth in 30 CFR 773.5 ever existed. Thus, if an individual is shown on AVS as being linked
to a corporation by virtue of his or her position as an officer of such corporation, see 30 CFR 773.5(b)(1), evidence
demonstrating that such individual is not and has never been an officer of the corporation would support a determination
that an ownership or control link based upon such a relationship is erroneous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A determination that a link has been ``rebutted'' means that, while the facts in the case show that a presumed ownership
or control relationship as set forth in 30 CFR 773.5(b) exists or existed, sufficient evidence has been presented
to demonstrate that the ``person subject to the presumption [did] *&blank;*&blank;* not in fact have the authority
directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation [was] conducted
*&blank;*&blank;*.'' See 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, if the individual in the preceding example was, in fact, an officer of the corporation, but did not have
authority or demonstrated control over the conduct of the surface coal mining operation, the presumption of ownership
or control would be rebutted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (d) of the proposed rule have been adopted as proposed. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of &sect;773.24
provides that OSM is required to serve a copy of its decision with respect to a challenge upon the applicant or other
challenger by U.S. certified mail or by any other means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and
complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date of service of the decision will set a date certain from which the time for appeals will begin to run. The regulation
provides that service is complete upon tender of the notice or of the mail and is not deemed incomplete by virtue of a
challenger's refusal to accept the notice or mail. The theory of this provision is to assure that a challenger is not
able to delay the running of the time for appeal by avoiding or refusing service of OSM's decision and then claiming
that he or she was never served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.24 has been adopted as proposed. As provided in the proposed rule, the final version
of this paragraph provides that the applicant or other challenger can appeal OSM's decision to OHA within 30 days of
such decision in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

decision in these matters with the opportunity to appeal the decision to OHA.

The preamble to the ownership or control rules published in 1988 provided that appeals by individuals from OSM decisions
with respect to information contained in AVS were made to the Department's Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management,
and Budget under procedures developed under the Privacy Act of 1974. Appeals by entities other than individuals were
made to OHA. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and
Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38879 (``Procedures to Amend Applicant Violator System Information'') (October
3, 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, pursuant to a delegation from the Department's Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management and Budget, the
authority to decide appeals with respect to information contained in AVS was delegated to OHA. Consistent with such
delegation, OSM believes that a single process of appeal for both individuals and entities will promote consistency
for both the public and the regulated community and that such appeal process should be explicitly contained in the
final rule. As provided in the proposed rule, paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of the final rule provides that OSM's decision
would remain in effect unless temporary relief were granted in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.24 provides for temporary relief from OSM's decision, if OHA grants such relief
in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR part 4. Under the final regulation, the period during which a person may
file a notice of appeal or the actual filing of an appeal will not automatically suspend the use of the information in
AVS during the pendency of such appeal. The challenger will have to explicitly seek such relief in appeal proceedings
before OHA and be granted such relief. See also 43 CFR 4.21(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering a request for temporary relief, OHA will apply the criteria of Section 525(c) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1275(c),
to determine whether such relief is warranted. See OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. To grant temporary relief under
such criteria, OHA will have to find that the challenger has a substantial likelihood of prevailing in his appeal of
the OSM decision and that temporary relief, if granted, will not adversely affect the health or safety of the public
or cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether the granting of temporary relief would cause significant, imminent environmental harm,
OHA will not attempt to decide whether a denial of temporary relief will compel the applicant or other challenger to
abate a violation posing such harm. It is not the intent of these rules to force a person to abate a violation even if he
or she is able to show a substantial likelihood that he or she had no ownership or control over the operation that is in
violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, OHA will focus its attention upon the compliance history of those persons who do appear to have had ownership
or control over operations in violation, to determine whether the granting of temporary relief would pose a risk of
significant, imminent environmental harm at sites for which new permits could be issued during the pendency of the
appeal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, the provisions of the proposed rule are adopted with the modifications noted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal of former proposed &sect;773.25 which would have provided procedures for challenging ownership or control
links prior to entry in AVS.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September, 1991 proposal, OSM proposed a rule to provide procedures for challenging ownership or control links
prior to entry in AVS. That proposal which was numbered as proposed &sect;773.25 represented OSM's attempt to go beyond
the Constitutional requirements of due process. The proposal would have prospectively required OSM or a State regulatory
authority to provide notice to those persons who were actively involved in surface coal mining operations and who
were linked to a violation through ownership or control before such link information would be used to subject them
to permit denial through AVS. Such persons would then have had an opportunity to challenge such information. Upon
further consideration, OSM has decided to withdraw the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM believes that adequate due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard are afforded by current practices
which permit a challenge to ownership or control and violation information after it is incorporated into AVS. Such
challenges can be made currently both within the context of a permit application and independent of such an application.
OSM believes that these opportunities suffice to pass constitutional muster. See Preamble to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (``Due Process Provided'') and at page 38879 (``Procedures to Amend Applicant Violator System
Information'') (October 3, 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department's OHA is contemporaneously adopting a rule providing for temporary relief from an ownership
or control link, under specified conditions. Such a rule significantly enhances the already available due process
protections available to the members of the regulated community. The risk that someone will be inappropriately subjected
to a permit block due to an erroneous link is substantially mitigated by the temporary relief procedures available
before OHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the proposed rule would have subjected OSM and State regulatory authorities to a substantial paperwork
morass as a condition precedent to implementing the provisions of &sect;510(c) of the Act. OSM, which has been utilizing
procedures similar to those proposed in the September, 1991, rule, discovered that the process was taking substantial
amounts of time and resources to implement. The dialogue and paper exchange between the agency and persons debating
the proposed ownership or control link was a prolonged exercise lasting, in some cases, for many months. Also, OSM
was finding that most of these debates made no difference in the ultimate outcome, except where entities refuted the
facts which would invoke a link. Typically, the ownership or control link was found to be well taken. The prolonged
debate was preventing accurate information from being incorporated into AVS. During the period of the dialogue,
the individual or entity subject to the ownership or control link was not relieved of the cloud of the potential link
and the agency was not able to directly implement the link. Neither OSM nor the person challenging the link benefited
by this course of events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, industry, environmental advocates, and representatives of State regulatory authorities were dissatisfied
with the proposed rule. Industry commenters condemned the proposed rule as providing insufficient due process for
challengers of ownership or control links. Environmental advocates criticized the proposal as deficient in not
providing a set time frame for OSM to bring ownership or control decisions to closure and to incorporate such decisions
into AVS. A commenter representing State regulatory authorities asserted that the proposed rules should either
provide for no challenge of an ownership or control link prior to permit denial or for conditional issuance of a permit
pending full challenge of an ownership or control link. As is stated above in the portion of this preamble captioned
``Due Process,'' OSM is unwilling, for a number of significant reasons, to accept that permits may be conditioned
upon the appeal of ownership or control links. Nevertheless, the criticisms of the commenter representing the State
regulatory authorities, the industry commenters, and the environmental advocacy groups also caused OSM to reconsider
the proposed rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given that the incorporation of accurate and complete information into AVS in a timely manner is critical to the development
and implementation of AVS, OSM believes that the needs of these constituent groups are addressed more effectively
by the provisions of the OHA rule. OSM remains committed to developing complete and accurate information for entry
into AVS, and as part of this process will of course consider information submitted by any party which would establish
or refute facts relevant to an ownership or control link. To the extent that a person is injured by an erroneous ownership
or control link, the OHA temporary relief procedure quickly and effectively neutralizes such injury in a timely manner.
The availability of such a process enables OSM to go forward in an expeditious manner to utilize its resources to develop
information, rather than engage in prolonged paper exchanges; to avoid delay in incorporating information into
AVS, thus responding to the concerns of environmental advocates; and to address effectively the concerns of the industry
which can invoke an administrative process outside of OSM for quick relief if the claims of injury are meritorious.
Additionally, by enabling challengers to go to OHA more quickly, the focus of the challenge procedures shifts to OHA,
a forum created to address such challenges of agency decisions. Finally, OSM can meet the terms of its continuing mandate
from Congress to develop and implement the AVS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In appropriate cases, OSM may engage in a dialogue and exchange of documents with persons subject to a proposed ownership
or control link prior to incorporating an ownership or control link into AVS. OSM will do this, however, only when OSM
believes it needs additional information concerning the proposed ownership or control link. In that case, such a
dialogue would enhance OSM's investigative process and assist in the development of relevant information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above, OSM has withdrawn this portion of the September, 1991, proposal and is renumbering the
remaining provisions of the final rules presented today to reflect the deletion of former proposed &sect;773.25.

Section 773.25_Standards for Challenging Ownership or Control Links and the Status of Violations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed section 773.26 would have established standards for challenges to ownership or control links and for challenges
to the status of violations. The proposed section would have allocated responsibilities between OSM and State regulatory
authorities for resolving issues related to ownership and control and would have provided the substantive criteria
for resolving such issues. In recognition of OSM's withdrawal of former proposed &sect;773.25, proposed &sect;773.26
has been renumbered as final rule &sect;773.25. For the reasons discussed below, the final rule also has been modified
to delete the substantive criteria to resolve ownership or control issues previously contained in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that its provisions would have been applicable to any challenge
concerning an ownership or control link or the status of a violation when such challenge was made under the provisions
of 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); proposed &sect;773.23 (the regulatory authority's
review of ownership or control and violation information), proposed &sect;773.24 (procedures for challenging
ownership or control links shown in AVS), and proposed &sect;773.25 (procedures for challenging ownership or control
links prior to entry in AVS); or 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of permitting decisions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided the basic allocation of authority among regulatory authorities
to make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the regulatory authority before which an
application was pending would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of
the applicant. Such regulatory authority would have had responsibility for reviewing information submitted by
the applicant and other available information to ensure the complete identification of the applicant's ownership
or control links.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the regulatory authority that issued a permit
would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee. Such decisions
would be necessary in determining whether the permit was improvidently issued, pursuant to 30 CFR 773.20. The regulatory
authority which issued a permit would have done so based upon a complete review of ownership or control information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the State regulatory authority that issued
a State violation notice would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of
any person cited in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the regulatory authority that issued a violation
notice, whether State or Federal, would have had authority for making decisions concerning the status of the violation
covered by the notice. The ``status'' of the violation meant whether the violation remained outstanding, had been
corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30
CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that OSM would have authority for making decisions
with respect to the ownership or control of any person cited in a Federal violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the allocation principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the proposed rule, a regulatory authority
that was deciding whether a permit application should be granted or whether a permit had been improvidently issued
would have determined for itself the ownership or control of the applicant or permittee, but it would have deferred
to the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice for a determination of the ownership or control of the violator.
The application would be blocked or the permit would be found improvidently issued if any owner or controller of the
applicant or permittee were also an owner or controller of a violator, as determined by the respective regulatory
authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the authority of State regulatory authorities
to make decisions with respect to ownership or control links or the status of violations would have been subject to
OSM's oversight authority under 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. Under paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26,
when OSM disagreed with a decision of a State regulatory authority, it would have taken action, as appropriate, under
proposed &sect;843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control of the status
of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have established evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and
informal review of ownership or control links and the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that in any formal or informal review of an ownership
or control link or of the status of a violation, the agency responsible for making a decision would be required to make
first a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists or that the violation remains outstanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26, a challenger of a link to a violation would have had to prove at least
one of three proposed conclusions by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26, a challenger could have proven that the facts relied
upon by the responsible agency to establish ownership or control within the terms of 30 CFR 773.5(a) or to establish
a presumption of ownership or control under 30 CFR 773.5(b) do not or did not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a person subject to a presumption of ownership or control
under 30 CFR 773.5(b) could have rebutted such presumption by demonstrating that he or she does not or did not in fact
have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations are or were
conducted. Such demonstration would have been made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of proposed
&sect;773.26.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a challenger could have proven that the violation
covered by a violation notice did not exist, had been corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject
of a good faith appeal within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) of proposed section 773.26 described the type of evidence that a person challenging an ownership
or control link or the status of a violation would have had to present to meet the burden of proof by a preponderance of
the evidence. The proposed regulation provided that the evidence presented would have had to have been probative,
reliable, and substantial. See 5 U.S.C. 556(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a challenger could have submitted affidavits setting
forth specific facts concerning the scope of responsibility of the various owners or controllers of an applicant,
a permittee, or any person cited in a violation notice; the duties actually performed by such owners or controllers;
the beginning and ending dates of such owners' or controllers' affiliation with the applicant, permittee, or person
cited in a violation notice; and the nature and details of any transaction creating or severing an ownership or control
link; or specific facts concerning the status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of proposed &sect;773.26 looked to official certification as the basis
for the reliability of a submitted document. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) would have allowed for the submission of certified
copies of corporate minutes, stock ledgers, contracts, purchase and sale agreements, leases, correspondence,
or other relevant company records. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) would have allowed for the submission of certified copies
of documents filed with or issued by any State, municipal, or Federal governmental agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel
in support of his or her position. Under the proposed rule, such opinion would have been appropriate for submission
when it was supported by evidentiary materials and when it was rendered by an attorney who certified that he or she had
personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter and that he or she was qualified to render the opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that, when the decision of the responsible agency was reviewed
by an administrative or judicial tribunal, the challenger could have presented any evidence to such tribunal which
was admissible under the rules of the tribunal. Under the proposed regulation, however, the evidence submitted would
still have to have been probative, credible, and substantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26 represented OSM's attempt to offer substantive standards which would have
established what must be proved by those seeking to rebut the presumptions of ownership or control contained in current
&sect;773.5(b) of this title. Proof of the facts set forth in the proposed regulation would have established that
the presumed owner or controller did not, in fact, have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner
in which the relevant surface coal mining operation was conducted, under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the proposed standards contained in paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have allowed a presumed
owner or controller to demonstrate that he or she lacked control over a surface coal mining operation by presenting
evidence that he or she actually lacked authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant
surface coal mining operation would be conducted. In the alternative, with respect to a presumed owner or controller
of a violator, the proposed standards would have allowed a person to present evidence that he or she took all reasonable
steps within his or her authority to cause the violation to be abated and that such abatement was prevented by those
in actual control of the mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided for the review and revision of information in AVS to reflect
determinations made by regulatory authorities in response to challenges of ownership or control links or the status
of violations. The proposed provision would have provided that, following any determination by a State regulatory
authority or other State agency, or following any decision by an administrative or judicial tribunal reviewing such
determination, the State regulatory authority would have been required to review the information in AVS to determine
if such information was consistent with the determination or decision. If it were not consistent, the State regulatory
authority would have been required to promptly inform OSM and to request that the AVS information be revised to reflect
the determination or decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters criticized the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed &sect;773.26 as violating due
process by not providing an owner or controller with the opportunity to challenge the existence of the violation at
the time it was cited. They further criticized the provisions of the proposed rule as violating State primacy. In substance,
they asserted that the proposed rule ``balkanized'' the permit application process by allowing the regulatory authority
that issued a violation to identify the ownership or control links to the violation. They asserted that this provision
impermissibly allowed such regulatory authority to play a role in the permit application process. They further argued
that the regulatory authority before which an application was pending should be the sole decisionmaker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with these views. OSM has already addressed these issues in detail in previous sections of this preamble
captioned ``Due Process'' and ``Primacy.'' Further, OSM has clarified that a permittee may, within the context of
the improvident permit issuance process, challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. See discussion
above in this preamble, ``Section 773.20_Improvidently Issued Permits: General Procedures.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities took exception to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of proposed
&sect;773.26 which would have provided that State determinations of ownership or control challenges be subject
to OSM's oversight authority. The commenter asserted that those provisions were duplicative of other provisions
of current regulations which provide for OSM's oversight of the States such as 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. He further
asserted that the Act established OSM's oversight power over the States and that such power required no reiteration
by the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters representing State regulatory authorities argued that, under a system of State primacy,
OSM has no authority to act, on a case by case basis, with respect to a particular permit decision by a State regulatory
program, other than revoking the State's approved regulatory program. Thus, they questioned OSM's authority to
review a State's decision with respect to ownership or control. They also argued that, if OSM review of State ownership
or control decisions was done, this would lead to duplication and disruption in the permit application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these commenters asserted that the provisions of the proposed regulation should be deleted, they proposed
that, if OSM insisted on going forward with the proposed provision or a similar rule providing for OSM oversight of
State decisions, the final rule should make explicit that the initial decision of a State regulatory authority with
respect to an ownership or control issue would be considered presumptively correct. They also proposed that a standard
such as ``gross inadequacy'' should be the standard for OSM to apply to the review of the State decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. First, OSM rejects the commenters' view that the proposed regulation
is unnecessary since the Act and regulations already provide for OSM's oversight of the States. The provisions of
SMCRA such as sections 201, 503, 504, 505, and 521, and the provisions of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR parts 733,
842, and 843 do establish a system of State primacy subject to Federal oversight. Nevertheless, such provisions do
not explicitly address every question which could arise in the implementation of the relationship between OSM and
the States with respect to &sect;510(c) of the Act which, as has been previously discussed in this preamble, invokes
significant issues of State primacy and Federal oversight. Further, the implementation of the AVS also invokes issues
of State primacy and Federal oversight. Multiple State regulatory authorities and OSM will be making ownership or
control decisions at various stages which are relevant to issues arising under section 510(c) of the Act. While the
proposed regulation is consistent with the Act and with OSM's existing regulations, the proposed regulation's allocation
of responsibilities among the regulatory authorities who will be making ownership or control decisions relevant
to section 510(c) of the Act has not been previously part of the Federal regulations. The allocation of responsibilities
provides necessary clarification to the regulated community, to regulatory authorities, and to the public. Accordingly,
OSM must reject the view that the proposed regulation is duplicative of current regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further rejects the view that, under a system of State primacy, OSM has no authority to act, on a case by case basis,
with respect to a particular permit decision by a State regulatory program, other than revoking the State's approved
regulatory program. A number of provisions of the Federal regulations, including 30 CFR 842.11 and 843.21, are very
explicit in providing that OSM can exercise necessary oversight authority with respect to a particular permit without
revoking a State's entire regulatory program. These other provisions are consistent with the system of State primacy
established by SMCRA. The proposed regulation is similarly consistent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, OSM has a particularly strong interest in working to assure that ownership or control decisions are made
correctly because the fruits of such decisionmaking will be incorporated into AVS. As has been previously discussed,
AVS is used across State lines by the various State regulatory authorities and by OSM itself. Accordingly, a decision
made with respect to an ownership or control link by one State regulatory authority has the potential to effect the
outcomes of permit decisions by many regulatory authorities. Without consistency, there would be chaos. Federal
oversight in these matters supports consistency among the various States in the application of the ownership or control
rules and the outcomes of the decisions on ownership or control issues. Since these State decisions are ultimately
incorporated into AVS, OSM's oversight supports the quality of the AVS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, there is no reason to conclude that the exercise of Federal oversight, pursuant to the provisions of the proposed
regulation, will lead to disruption in the permit application process. Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26
and the provisions of the final regulation discussed below are designed to avoid such disruption by allocating responsibilities
among the various regulatory authorities who each have a legitimate interest in the outcome of an ownership or control
issue. The oversight provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 are designed to support such allocation
of responsibilities in a way that is consistent with SMCRA and OSM's implementing regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further believes that the commenter's proposal that a final rule should make explicit that the initial decision
of a State regulatory authority with respect to an ownership or control issue will be considered presumptively correct
is adequately addressed. In substance, the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of final &sect;773.25 discussed below
already provide that State regulatory authorities who are issuing violations, considering permit applications,
and issuing permits with the first opportunity to decide the owners or controllers of, respectively, violations,
applications, and permits. While the first opportunity to make a particular decision is not equivalent to a legal
presumption in favor of the decision, such an opportunity does give a State regulatory authority the chance to define
the status quo which would be subject to oversight review. OSM declines, however, to convert such initial decisionmaking
opportunity into a presumption. The need for consistency with respect to ownership or control decisions and with
respect to AVS require that OSM conduct oversight reviews of such State decisions as are necessary without the application
of a presumption favoring the affirmance of such decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM also declines to incorporate a standard such as ``gross inadequacy'' or some other criterion as the basis for Federal
oversight of State ownership or control decisions under paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26. The application
of such a standard would limit OSM's ability to review State decisions for purposes of protecting the consistency
and accuracy of information in the AVS. As will be discussed with respect to the final rule &sect;773.25 below, OSM
has made modifications to proposed &sect;773.26 to reflect OSM's responsibility for the ownership or control information
shown on AVS and to enable OSM to act to maintain the integrity of the AVS database. With respect to oversight incident
to particular applications, permits, and violations, paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 already contains
references to 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. Final rule &sect;773.25 contains identical references. Each of these
parts of Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations contains provisions which have explicit criteria and triggering
standards for OSM's review and action with respect to State decisions. Such criteria and standards are incorporated
by reference in paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 and would be applied, as appropriate, by OSM. Accordingly,
there is no need for additional review criteria in OSM's oversight under the proposed regulation. As discussed below,
final rule &sect;773.25 adopts the same approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing environmental advocacy groups questioned whether the provisions of paragraph (b) of proposed
&sect;773.26 sufficiently explained the allocation of responsibilities between OSM and State regulatory authorities.
The commenter questioned the provision of the proposal contained at paragraph (b)(3) which provided that State regulatory
authorities' authority to make ownership or control decisions would be subject to OSM's review as an element of State
program oversight. The commenter asserted that this provision required further clarification as to the respective
roles of OSM and the State regulatory authorities in the making of ownership or control decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees with the commenter's observation that further clarification is in order with respect to the allocation
of responsibilities and authority contained in paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26. Accordingly, OSM has
made a change to the final rule to clarify that, with respect to information shown on AVS, State responsibilities to
make decisions with respect to ownership or control are subject to OSM's plenary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, under the final rule, once ownership or control information is entered into AVS, OSM will assume control of such
data. If OSM reviews such information and concludes that it is incorrect, OSM will act to correct such ownership or
control information and will incorporate such corrected information into AVS. The rationale for OSM's plenary authority
is that AVS is used across State lines by all of the State regulatory authorities and the Federal government must act
to protect the accuracy and integrity of AVS. With respect to the State regulatory authority's decision underlying
such ownership or control information, OSM will further act pursuant to the provisions of final &sect;843.24, which
is described in detail below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, OSM must reject the view that, because ownership or control issues are invoked, OSM must be initially
involved in every permit application decision made by a State regulatory authority. The primary responsibility
and authority for making a decision whether to issue or deny a permit is with the regulatory authority before which
an application is pending. The primary responsibility and authority under a State regulatory program for issuing
a violation is with that State's regulatory authority. The primary responsibility for the ongoing supervision of
a permit is with the State regulatory authority which issued the permit. Accordingly, while OSM has changed some of
the terminology in the final rule for reasons which are discussed below, OSM has not changed the basic conceptual framework
contained in paragraph (b)(3) of proposed section 773.26. That framework is that the regulatory authority which
is considering an application, which has issued a permit, or which has issued a violation has initial authority for
making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships respectively invoked by the application,
the permit, and the violation. OSM has program oversight authority of such decisions under 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and
843.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter further indicated that the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of the proposed section allocated the authority
to review State decisions with respect to permit applications to OSM, but that OSM could exercise such authority only
after a permit had been issued, in accordance with proposed &sect;843.24, and that this would cause friction between
OSM and the States. The commenter proposed that, if OSM believed that an ownership or control link had not been made
or had been severed improperly by a State regulatory authority considering a permit application, the permit should
not be issued until OSM and the State regulatory authority resolved their dispute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's concern. In any system involving Federal oversight of the States, there is the potential
for disagreements between the States and the Federal government. SMCRA is no exception. For instance, the invocation
of the improvidently issued permit process by OSM, pursuant to 30 CFR 843.21, subjects the State's permit application
review process to close scrutiny with respect to the permit in question. This is one of the remedies provided in proposed
&sect;843.24 which paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 would make applicable. There is potential for stress
in this process. To help avoid to improvident issuance of permits, however, OSM, through its AVS Office, has attempted
to be accessible to the States and to work with the States have the benefit of OSM's most current opinions with respect
to particular ownership or control situations. Whether a State regulatory authority chooses to avail itself of this
service is a matter within the discretion of the State regulatory authority which has the primary authority to decide
whether to issue a permit. Principles of State primacy make it inappropriate, however, to mandate such consultations
with respect to every permit application. Accordingly, OSM declines to modify the rule to mandate that OSM intervene
in the State permit application process to require that the State not issue a permit if OSM disagrees with the State's
resolution of an ownership or control issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters criticized the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26. They questioned the
requirement contained in the proposed regulation that a regulatory authority make a prima facie determination whether
an ownership or control link exists to a violation and that such violation remains ``outstanding.'' They asserted
that the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require the denial of permits for ``unabated'' violations only, not
``outstanding'' violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require that a regulatory
authority not issue a permit if information available to it indicates that ``any surface coal mining operation owned
or controlled by the applicant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is currently in violation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the Act'' or other laws specified. (Emphasis added.) Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 requires a prima
facie determination whether the violation covered by a violation notice ``remains outstanding.'' A violation which
``remains outstanding'' is one which is ``current.'' The plain meaning of these phrases is the same. Further, by the
use of the words ``remains outstanding'' in the proposed regulation, OSM did not intend to change the standard established
by section 510(c) of the Act. Instead, OSM merely sought, as the Federal agency charged with implementing SMCRA, to
provide a workable phrase defining a current violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further objected to paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 insofar as such proposal required
an applicant to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the applicant did not own or control the violator
within the meaning of the regulations. The commenters asserted that the imposition of such a burden of proof upon the
applicant was inconsistent with section 510(c) of the Act and that the use of such an evidentiary burden was only appropriate
for formal proceedings before tribunals, rather than informal proceedings before State regulatory authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with commenters' objections. The imposition of such a burden of proof is entirely consistent with the
provisions of section 510(c) of the Act which require that, when available information indicates that a surface coal
mining operation ``owned or controlled by the applicant'' is in current violation of the Act or other laws listed,
the permit not be issued ``until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process
of being corrected.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the statute is silent as to how an applicant may demonstrate that he or she does not own or control a surface
coal mining operation. Under the Act, it is the duty of OSM, the administrative agency charged with implementing the
Act, to ``publish and promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions
of *&blank;*&blank;* [the] Act.'' See section 201(c)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM proposed, and today is finalizing, a regulation which carries out the purposes of section 510(c) of the Act
and places the burden of evidence production and persuasion upon the person challenging an ownership or control link
to a current violation. This is consistent with the provisions of that section of the Act which clearly place the burden
of going forward with proof that a violation has been corrected or is in the process of correction upon the applicant
who owns or controls a surface coal mining operation which is in violation of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in the absence of some means of showing that he or she does not own or control a particular surface coal mining
operation which is in violation of the Act, an applicant who owned or controlled such an operation would only be able
to receive a permit if he or she could produce proof that the current violation was corrected or was in the process of
correction. As indicated above, consistent with its statutory role to propose regulations, OSM has provided the
``means'' for an applicant to show that he or she does not control a surface coal mining operation by establishing the
burden of proof and evidentiary standards contained in paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OSM must reject the notion that the burden of proof contained in the proposed regulation is inappropriate
for use by State regulatory authorities. Burdens of proof are used in formal litigation before tribunals because
they are helpful to the resolution of such litigation. Such burdens establish the parameters of what parties to litigation
must do to prevail in their claims. Similarly, challengers of ownership or control links need to know what parameters
they need to meet in proceedings before regulatory authorities to challenge such links. Also, in making decisions
with respect to ownership or control or with respect to the status of violations, regulatory authorities need guidance
in assisting their decisionmaking process. In the absence of guidance establishing burdens of proof and evidentiary
standards, the resulting decisions made may be inconsistent and based upon uncertain standards. For instance, one
regulatory authority may believe the any quantity of evidence, including a mere scintilla, is sufficient to successfully
challenge an ownership or control link to a violation. Another regulatory authority may believe that a successful
challenge requires a challenger to demonstrate that an ownership or control link is rebutted beyond any reasonable
doubt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM's proposed rule has provided a single standard of persuasion and production, a preponderance of the evidence,
to be required for the successful challenge of an ownership or control link. OSM believes that such a standard represents
a prudent middle ground between the possible extremes of burdens of proof requiring a mere scintilla of evidence and
those requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. OSM is confident that State regulatory authorities will be able
to implement such a standard and that it will prove helpful. Accordingly, OSM rejects the commenters' assertion that
the use of the evidentiary burden of production contained in the proposed rule is inappropriate for State regulatory
authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further criticized paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 for requiring, as one of the bases
to rebut a presumption of ownership or control, proof that the facts relied upon to establish such presumption do not
or did not exist. The commenters asserted that such a test may foreclose a demonstration that the regulatory authority
which established such presumption reached the wrong legal conclusion, notwithstanding the truth of the facts.
Further, the commenters asserted, in substance, that the provisions of the proposed section imply that the challenger
would have to disprove all of the facts which were considered by the agency which established the presumption of ownership
or control, not just the relevant facts which support the presumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM does not agree with commenters' assertions. Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 was intended to provide
the parameters as to what factual demonstration must be made by a challenger of an ownership or control link. Accordingly,
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 provision provides for the challenge of a link by proof that the facts
necessary to invoke the presumption of ownership or control did not or do not exist. Nothing in such proof of facts precludes
legal arguments which could be made, including those questioning the application of the presumption under the operative
facts. Further, facts relevant to that legal issue could be presented under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)
of proposed &sect;773.26 which provides that a person could demonstrate that he or she does not or did not have authority
directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations are or were conducted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, under the provisions of the proposed regulation, challengers would only have to present proof with respect
to factual issues which are relevant to the invocation of the presumption of ownership or control. If the presumption
turns upon certain key factual issues, these are the issues upon which the challenge will focus. Challengers will
not be required to disprove irrelevant facts which may have been included in the administrative record of the agency
which initially established the presumption of ownership or control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry commenters further objected to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 which provides that
a person seeking to challenge a presumption could demonstrate that he or she did not have authority directly or indirectly
to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. The commenters questioned whether
the requirement that a person prove that he or she did not have such indirect authority was an attempt by OSM to impermissibly
extend the reach of the ownership or control regulations to cover persons remote from surface coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM denies that the proposed provision represents an attempt to impermissibly extend the reach of the ownership or
control regulations. In fact, the proposed standard was taken from currently operative ownership and control regulations.
The provisions of paragraph (b) of 30 CFR 773.5, which have been effective since November 2, 1988, state that a person
subject to one or more of the presumptions contained in paragraph (b) of that regulation is presumed to be an owner or
controller unless there is a demonstration that ``the person subject to the presumption does not in fact have the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
authority directly or indirectly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation is conducted.'' (Emphasis added.) This
is the same standard which is also contained in paragraph (a)(3) of 30 CFR 773.5. The purpose of this standard is to enable:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
the regulatory authority *&blank;*&blank;* [to] examine any relationships and the facts surrounding them, such
as informal agreements, personal relationships, and the mining history of the parties in question to determine if
the relationship results in control over a surface coal mining operation. The regulatory authority may also consider
any of the circumstances surrounding a surface coal mining operation to determine control. Such circumstances might
include, for example, the fact that a person has financed the operation, or owns the equipment or the rights to the coal,
or directs on-site operations.

See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final
Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38870 (October 3, 1988). Further, whether a person is ``remote'' in a corporate chain of command
is not the issue under the standard. The issue is whether the totality of the circumstances indicate that the person
had the authority to exercise control over the relevant surface coal mining operation. Such ``authority'' includes
control or the power to control.

Id., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
at pages 38870&hyph;38871. The resolution of such issues is necessary for the regulatory authority's analysis of
an ownership or control challenge. Accordingly, requiring a person challenging a presumption of ownership or control
to make such demonstration is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry commenters proposed that paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26 be modified to provide that a person challenging
the presumption be able to prove that the agency relied upon incorrect facts to support its determination of ownership
or control; that the person subject to the presumption did not have knowledge of the violation, did not authorize the
activity that led to the violation, or did not have direct authority to determine the manner in which surface coal mining
operations were conducted; or that the ownership or control link has been severed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenters' proposal. Nevertheless, OSM will not adopt the commenters' proposed modifications
for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 already contain language providing for a challenger's
proof that the facts relied upon by regulatory authority to make a determination of ownership or control did not or
do not exist. Such language is inclusive of the commenters' proposal that a challenger be allowed to submit proof that
the agency relied upon incorrect facts to support its determination of ownership or control.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the language contained in OSM's proposed regulation would also encompass the commenters' proposal that
a challenger be able to provide proof that an ownership or control link has been severed. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)
of the proposed regulation, such proof would be included as evidence that the facts relied upon by the regulatory authority
to establish ownership or control or a presumption of ownership or control did not or do not exist. Whether such proof
is sufficient to support a successful challenge to an ownership or control link will depend upon the facts of each case.
OSM must reject the implication of commenters' proposal that the severance of a current ownership or control link
to a violator would relieve a person from permit block in all cases. For instance, if a person was an owner or controller
of a violator during the period in which the violation was committed, severance of his or her current ownership or control
relationship with the company would not relieve him or her of responsibility created through the prior ownership
or control link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM must further reject commenters' proposal to the extent that it would establish a standard which would enable a
challenger of an ownership or control link to a violation to challenge the link by proof that he lacked knowledge of
the violation; that he did not authorize the activity which led to the violation; or that he did not have direct authority
to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. Commenters' proposal must be rejected
because it ignores the control which stems from indirect authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees that all of commenters' proposed standards invoke factual matters which may be relevant when a regulatory
authority considers an ownership or control link to a violation. As such, proof of each of these matters could be presented
within the context of the presentation of facts made under paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26. For instance,
proof presented that a person had no knowledge of a violation; that he or she did not actually authorize a violation;
or that he or she did not have direct authority for the surface coal mining operation may well reflect on the contours
of the person's responsibilities with a presumptively owned or controlled entity. Nevertheless, such facts may
also constitute a false shield which has been created to conceal the substantive, indirect control that the person
has over a surface coal mining operation. Commenters' proposal is flawed, therefore, because it would enable a challenger
to successfully challenge an ownership or control link by simply proving lack of actual knowledge, actual authority,
or direct control, without requiring proof that a presumed owner or controller also lacked indirect authority over
the surface coal mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further proposed a modification to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26. In OSM's
proposal, that paragraph prohibited a challenge as to the existence of the violation within the context of a challenge
to an ownership or control link or a challenge to the status of the violation. Commenters proposed changes to allow
a challenge as to the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. For the reasons discussed with respect to this
issue in the section of this preamble captioned ``Due Process'' and in the previous discussion of changes made to final
&sect;773.20, OSM has generally rejected commenters' proposal but has accepted such proposal with respect to the
improvident permit issuance process. Also, at the time of permit denial, a permit applicant can appeal any reason
for such denial including the existence of a violation assuming that the applicant is not bound by a prior administrative
or judicial determination or has not had a prior opportunity to challenge the existence of the violation. Accordingly,
OSM has amended paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final rule &sect;773.25 to clarify that a challenge may be made by a permittee
acting within the context of the improvident permit issuance process under &sect;&sect;773.20&hyph;773.21. This
is in recognition of the more significant interest that a permittee has in a permit compared to the limited interest
that an applicant has in a permit application. A permittee's ability to assert such a challenge will be limited, however,
if he or she had a prior opportunity to challenge the violation notice and failed to do so in a timely manner or if he or
she is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities indicated concern that paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26
contained legal terms such as ``prima facie determination,'' proof ``by a preponderance of the evidence,'' and ``probative,
reliable, and substantial evidence'' without providing definitions of such terms. The commenter indicated that
all of these terms have ``particular legal meanings.'' He urged that the proposed regulation be amended to incorporate
definitions of such terms, ``consistent with their common legal meanings.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's proposal. OSM disagrees, however, with commenter's view that the cited terms need
formal definition in the proposed regulation. As commenter has correctly noted, each of the cited terms has a traditional,
common legal meaning. In a proceeding to challenge an ownership or control link or the status of a violation, such terms
would have their traditional legal meanings. It is anticipated that such meanings will further evolve on a case by
case basis over time. Finally, with respect to the terms ``probative, reliable, and substantial'' as such terms describe
evidence, paragraph (c)(2) of proposed &sect;773.26 provides some examples of this type of evidence.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter representing a State regulatory authority criticized the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of the
proposed regulation because such provisions would potentially allow a challenger of an ownership or control link
to present evidence to a tribunal reviewing a decision of a regulatory authority which had not previously been presented
to the regulatory authority. The commenter proposed a modification to the regulation such that any evidence presented
on appeal by a challenger be limited to that which was presented to the regulatory authority at the time when the decision
being reviewed was made. The commenter proposed that evidence which was not reasonably available to the challenger
at the time of the regulatory authority's decision could, however, be presented for the consideration of the reviewing
tribunal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's proposal. One legitimate approach to the process of such challenges might be to limit
the presentation of evidence on review to that which had been previously presented to the regulatory authority which
made the decision which has been subjected to review. OSM believes, however, that the better approach is to allow the
presentation of any evidence admissible under the rules of the reviewing tribunal, including evidence which was
not previously presented to the regulatory authority. This will assure that the review of the decision with respect
to the ownership or control link or the status of a violation is based upon the most complete evidence available to all
parties participating in the review process. Such a review will help assure that all parties have the opportunity
to present their complete proof with respect to their respective positions in what is, substantively, a de novo proceeding.
Such complete evidence presentation and review may aid the legitimacy and acceptance of any final decision made incident
to such review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM disagrees with the view that such a process might encourage a challenger to withhold relevant evidence
for surprise presentation at a subsequent review proceeding. A challenger will have sufficient incentive to overcome
a presumed ownership or control link at the earliest possible time because he or she will want to avoid permit blocks
or further litigation. Accordingly, he or she can be expected to present the best evidence available to make the case
in favor of overcoming the presumed ownership or control link. Thus, OSM must reject the commenter's suggested modification
to the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters criticized paragraph (c)(2) of the proposed regulation for allowing the use of affidavits
in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link or to the status of a violation. The commenters asserted that
such materials contain self-serving statements and are unreliable. The commenters further asserted that affidavits
should not be the basis to overcome a presumption, in the absence of additional evidence supporting such affidavits.
The commenters proposed various modifications to the proposed rule which would require the submission of additional
information when affidavits are presented in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link. In this respect,
one commenter proposed a ``best evidence'' rule which would not allow the presentation of affidavits when there was
``better'' documentary evidence available, such as official copies of corporate records previously filed with
State corporation commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenters' concern with respect to affidavits. Nevertheless, affidavits do have certain indicators
of reliability. They are made under oath before a government official licensed to witness such oaths, a notary public.
Further, affidavits are recognized as evidence sufficient to support a motion for summary judgment in civil litigation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, OSM continues to consider affidavits as appropriate
evidence for a regulatory authority's review in the evaluation of a challenge to an ownership or control link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM agrees that, in most cases, an affidavit unsupported by other evidence may be insufficient to overcome
a presumption of ownership or control. There could be rare circumstances, however, where an affidavit by itself could
be the basis for rebuttal, given the totality of the circumstances involved. Such matters are appropriately addressed
on a case by case basis, rather than through a rule. Under the proposed rule, challengers are encouraged to submit additional
evidence along with affidavits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSM will not modify the proposed regulation to delete the use of affidavits or to require that affidavits
only be allowed as proof if accompanied by other supporting evidence in every case. Also, while OSM agrees that State
corporation commissions may be a good source of relevant ownership or control information, OSM declines to adopt
a ``best evidence'' test which would prevent the submission of affidavits when documents have been filed with State
corporation commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter representing environmental advocacy groups criticized paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of proposed &sect;773.26
insofar as the provisions allowed for the submission of an opinion of counsel in support of a challenge with respect
to an ownership or control link or with respect to the status of a violation. In substance, the commenter asserted that
such opinions present no factual evidence for the regulatory authority. Such opinions of counsel represent legal
opinions with respect to ownership or control and invade the province of the decisionmaker, the regulatory authority.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM agrees that an opinion of counsel should not, in itself, be considered ``evidence.'' Indeed, opinions of counsel
constitute legal analysis based upon factual information. Both proposed and final regulations require that such
opinions ``be supported by evidentiary materials.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM must disagree that such opinions should be excluded. By providing an opportunity for the submission
of such opinions, OSM is seeking to encourage counsel to conduct a diligent investigation of the facts and to assist
regulatory authorities by presenting the fruits of such investigation_the factual materials_along with counsel's
legal opinions as to the import of such evidence. The decision as to the weight to be given to the evidentiary materials
and the persuasiveness of the counsel's opinions remain with the regulatory authority considering the challenge
to the ownership or control link. Lawyers routinely argue their clients' positions to triers of fact and law. Such
argument does not invade the province of the decisionmaker which retains the authority to make the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has decided to allow for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in support of his or her position as part
of final &sect;773.25. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary materials;
when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and when counsel
states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel states that
such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the proposed rule only provided for such opinion when counsel made a personal investigation of the facts,
the final rule incorporates language to provide for opinions where such investigation has not been made. The basis
for this change is to reflect that, under certain circumstances, attorneys might not choose to conduct a complete
personal investigation of the factual representations made within the opinion. See Formal Opinion 346 (Revised),
Tax Law Opinions in Tax Shelter Investment Offerings, Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility,
American Bar Association (January 29, 1982).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such opinion is similar in type to that provided by counsel to an adversary party as to title, tax issues, or environmental
compliance in real estate transactions. The indicator of reliability in this document is that the attorney is offering
his or her opinion subject to professional standards provided by national and local bar associations and possible
sanctions for the violations of such standards which may be imposed by applicable rules of conduct governing attorneys.
In addition, under the final regulation, the attorney's opinion by itself is not enough to challenge an ownership
or control link. Evidentiary materials need to be submitted along with such opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the substantive change noted above, OSM has made non-substantive changes to the provision which clarify
the requirements of the final rule provision. Accordingly, OSM has adopted the proposed rule with the changes noted
as paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final &sect;773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26, required proof for the rebuttal of ownership or control
presumptions, represented OSM's attempt to offer substantive standards which would have established what must
be proved by those seeking to rebut the presumptions of ownership or control contained in current &sect;773.5(b)
of this title. Proof of the type of facts set forth in the proposed regulations would have established that the presumed
owner or controller did not, in fact, have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the
relevant surface coal mining operation was conducted, under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has determined not to go forward with paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26 and has, therefore, withdrawn that
portion of the proposed rule. In substance, OSM believes that ownership and control determinations are inherently
a case specific process. Each ownership or control matter turns on the totality of circumstances in a given case and
whether the evidence presented demonstrates that the presumed owner or controller does not or did not, in fact, have
the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation
was conducted. See 30 CFR 773.5(b)(1). The pragmatic focus of such an inquiry will continue to be whether a presumed
controller actually exercised control over an entity or had the substantive power to exercise control over an entity,
even if he or she chose not to actually exercise such power. As OSM has stated previously in the preamble to 30 CFR &sect;773.5(b),
``To the extent that a coal company 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
controls or can exercise control over a contract operator, it should be held responsible
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for any outstanding violations of the Act which it should have prevented or corrected.'' (Emphasis added.) See Preamble
to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR
38868 at page 38877 (October 3, 1988). In effect, a person challenging a presumption of control must demonstrate,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that neither of these two circumstances is applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it might be initially attractive for the agency to create a standard containing three or four elements, the proof
of which automatically rebuts a presumption, OSM is unwilling to impose such potentially rigid substantive tests
upon the process of analyzing ownership or control cases. OSM believes that such rigid standards do not serve the interests
of the States, industry, or OSM, because they might be taken to preclude consideration of other rebuttal evidence
not listed or, conversely, might force a State regulatory authority to accept a rebuttal which conforms substantially
to OSM's model but which, in the opinion of the regulatory authority, does not in fact rebut the presumption. OSM's
experience has taught that each ownership or control rebuttal requires an analysis of the presumed relationship
within the complete factual context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in analyzing the ownership or control profile of an entity, OSM will look to the totality of circumstances_with
the view to understanding how a particular entity operates and operated_to determine the true owners or controllers
of a surface coal mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups asserted that the rules should provide that any documents
submitted by persons challenging presumptions of ownership or control be considered part of the public record and
part of the permit file. On the other hand, industry commenters argued that the rules are deficient because they do
not contain a provision by which documentation submitted could be held confidential. They further asserted that
there was no means for a challenger to obtain a protective order with respect to confidential materials submitted
in support of a challenge.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM agrees that documents submitted in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link or in support of a challenge
to the status or the existence of a violation should normally be considered part of the public record. The public has
a legitimate interest in knowing and understanding the basis for a regulatory authority's decisions in these matters.
In a democracy, it is unreasonable for a governmental agency to make such decisions based upon secret information.
Further, the credibility of the regulatory authority and the integrity of its decisionmaking process require that
its decisions be supported by an adequate record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, OSM also recognizes that there may be valid competitive reasons why industry operators believe that
certain information needs to be kept confidential. For instance, a person may not wish to reveal the price which he
or she has paid for the coal extracted by a mine contractor for fear that other contractors or competitors will learn
of this information and change their prices or bids to the disadvantage of the person revealing the information. A
person concerned about such disclosure may be reluctant to submit a copy of the relevant contract because it contains
the agreed price. OSM disagrees, however, that these industry concerns require special provisions in the rules to
seal documents or to otherwise protect confidentiality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In balancing the concerns of the public and the coal industry with respect to public access to the submitted documents,
OSM will be guided by the principles of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA), and the Departmental regulations
implementing FOIA. See 43 CFR 2.11&hyph;2.22. Upon request by a member of the public, OSM will ordinarily make available
to the requestor documents provided by challengers of ownership or control links, the status of violations, and the
existence of violations. To the extent that a person submitting information to OSM asserts that the materials should
be kept confidential, OSM will evaluate that request in accordance with the applicable provisions of FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above analysis, OSM has determined that the interests of the commenters can be addressed under
current law and that the rule does not need to be modified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has determined to adopt a final version of the proposed rule. The final
rule has been renumbered as &sect;773.25 to reflect the withdrawal of proposed &sect;773.25, procedures for challenging
ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS. As indicated above, OSM has modified the provisions of the proposal
to allow for the submission of an opinion of counsel based upon evidence developed through counsel's personal investigation
or based upon facts which have been supplied to counsel in support of a challenge of an ownership or control presumption.
As further discussed above, OSM has inserted language in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) to clarify that a permittee may challenge
the existence of the violation at the time it was cited within the context of improvident permit issuance as provided
by &sect;&sect;773.20 and 773.21. OSM has also withdrawn paragraph (d) of the proposed rule, required proof for the
rebuttal of ownership or control presumptions, described above. The final rule contains no other substantive changes
from proposed rule &sect;773.26. The final rule contains certain other non-substantive modifications as described
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of final &sect;773.25 provides that provisions of &sect;773.25 are applicable to any challenge concerning
an ownership or control link or the status of a violation when such challenge is made under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20
and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); &sect;&sect;773.23 (the regulatory authority's review of ownership
or control and violation information), and 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown
in AVS); or under 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of permitting decisions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of the final rule differs from the proposed rule in that references to proposed &sect;773.25, procedures
for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS, have been deleted. A further change in this paragraph
from the proposed rule provides that the provisions of final &sect;773.25 apply to challenges of an ownership or control
``link to any person'' rather than only to a ``link to any person in a violation notice.'' The purpose of this change
is to clarify that the provisions of the section apply to challenges of ownership or control links including those
which do not generate a current link to an outstanding violation. OSM's experience has demonstrated that members
of the regulated community have, in many cases, sought proactively to challenge ownership or control links to other
persons, without regard to whether there were outstanding violations. Such challenges have been asserted, among
other reasons, to avoid the risk of being linked to future violations through such ownership or control relationships.
OSM recognizes that this is a legitimate concern. Accordingly, the change in the final rule allows the challenge of
ownership or control links without regard to whether there are outstanding violations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of final &sect;773.25 contains a further change from the proposed rule in that the regulation provides
that the provisions of the rule apply to challenges of ``the status of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 violation covered by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice.'' (Emphasis added.) The comparable section of the proposed regulation provided that the regulation applied
to the status of ``the violation covered by such notice.'' The purpose of the change is to recognize that there may be
multiple violations, rather than a single violation, to which a person is linked through ownership or control. A person
may wish to challenge the status of each of these violations, rather than only the violation contained in a single notice.
If so, the provisions of final &sect;773.25 apply to such challenges. Consistent with this change, ``such notice''
is changed to ``a notice.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of final &sect;773.25 provides the basic allocation of responsibility among regulatory authorities
to make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations. State regulatory
authorities are expected to have procedures in place to address challenges made in accordance with these rules, including
in situations where there are ongoing State proceedings in other jurisdictions on permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) if final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority before which an application is
pending has ``responsibility'' for making decisions with respect to the ``ownership or control relationships of
the application.'' This represents a change of terminology from the comparable provision of the proposed rule which
provided that the regulatory authority would have ``authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership
or control of the applicant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the use of the word ``responsibility,'' rather than ``authority,'' more accurately describes the regulatory
authority's mandate under this regulation. ``Responsibility'' encompasses both authority, the power to act, and
the obligation to act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25 speaks of ``ownership or control relationships of the application,''
rather than of the ``ownership or control of the applicant,'' as provided in the proposed rule. This change clarifies
that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending will evaluate and make decisions with respect
to the ownership and control issues with respect to an entire application, rather than just the particular applicant,
consistent with this regulatory authority's primary responsibility for the application. This regulatory authority
has responsibility for revising ownership or control information submitted as part of the permit application and
other available information to ensure the complete identification of ownership or control relationships relevant
to the decision to be made with respect to the application. The word ``relationships'' has been added to the regulation
because it better explains the focus of this process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a permit has responsibility
for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permit. The regulatory authority
which issued a permit would have done so based upon a complete review of ownership or control information as required
by the regulations. In the event that the improvidently issued permit regulations of 30 CFR 773.20 and 773.21 are invoked,
this regulatory authority will have to decide whether such permit has been improvidently issued and whether, if the
basis for such improvident issuance was an ownership or control link to a violator, whether such improvident issuance
has been remedied. Accordingly, that regulatory authority must make decisions with respect to ownership or control
relationships incident to the permit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of final &sect;773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained
in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to the changes made to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule
is applicable here. Again, the regulatory authority will be making decisions ``with respect to the ownership or control
relationships of the permit, ``rather than with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee,'' as provided
in the proposed rule. This reflects that regulatory authority's primary responsibility for the permit which it has
issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that the State regulatory authority that issued a State violation
notice has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the violation.
The State regulatory authority issuing the violation is in the best position to be aware, in the first instance, of
operative facts which identify those owners or controllers who have the ``authority directly or indirectly to determine
the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation is conducted'' and who can thus cause the abatement
of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained
in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to these changes in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule
is applicable here. Again, the regulatory authority will be making decisions ``with respect to the ownership or control
relationships of the violation,'' rather than ``with respect to the ownership or control of any person cited in such
notice [of violation],'' as provided in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of the final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice,
whether State or Federal, would have responsibility for making decisions concerning the status of the violation
covered by the notice. As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority''
previously contained in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to the similar change in paragraph
(b)(1)(i) of this final rule is applicable here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the proposed rule, the ``status'' of the violation means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been
corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR
773.15(b)(1). This approach is consistent with the provisions of section 510(c) of SMCRA which require that a regulatory
authority considering a permit application look to the ``agency that has jurisdiction over such violation'' to determine
whether a violation ``has been or is in the process of being corrected.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of final &sect;773.25 provides that OSM has responsibility for making decisions with respect to
the ownership or control relationships of a Federal violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained
in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to this change in paragraph (b)(1)(i) is applicable here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of final &sect;773.25 is essentially a Federal counterpart to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) and the same
basic rationale applies here, as well. This provision differs from (b)(1)(iii), however, in that OSM's authority
to decide the ownership and control relationships of a Federal violation notice is not initial responsibility as
the State's responsibility is in (b)(1)(iii). Instead, OSM's responsibility is final.This difference recognizes
that State regulatory authorities are subject to oversight by OSM. OSM is not subject to similar oversight by the States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the allocation principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of final &sect;773.25, a regulatory authority
deciding whether a permit application should be granted or whether a permit has been improvidently issued determines
for itself the ownership or control relationships of the application or permit, but it defers to the regulatory authority
that issued a violation notice for a determination of the ownership or control relationships of the violation. The
application is then denied or the permit subject to treatment under the regulations governing improvident issuance
if any owner or controller of the applicant or permittee is also an owner or controller of a violator, as determined
by the respective regulatory authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of final &sect;773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS, the responsibility
of State regulatory authorities to make decisions concerning ownership or control links will be subject to the plenary
authority of OSM. This represents a change from the comparable provision of the proposed rule which provided that
the authority of regulatory authorities to make ownership or control decisions with respect to applicants, permittees,
and persons cited in violation notices and decisions with respect to the status of violations would be subject to OSM's
review as an element of State program oversight under parts 733, 842, and 843.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for this change is simply that OSM is ultimately responsible for the maintenance and content of the AVS
with respect to ownership or control information. OSM believes that the quality of ownership or control information
is the core of AVS. OSM must closely monitor such information to maintain the accuracy of such information and the integrity
of AVS. The need to protect the integrity of the AVS dictates that OSM have the ability to review the underlying basis
supporting any ownership or control link shown on the system and to change information with respect to any ownership
or control link or all such links, if necessary. Accordingly, the final rule provides that OSM's authority will be
plenary with respect to ownership or control information shown on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, once ownership or control information is entered into AVS, OSM will assume control of such data. If OSM reviews
such information and concludes that it is incorrect, OSM will act to correct such ownership or control information
and incorporate such corrected information into AVS. OSM intends to coordinate any such changes with the regulatory
authority responsible for initial entry of the data in question.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of final &sect;773.25, with respect to information shown on AVS relating to the status
of a violation and with respect to ownership or control information which has not been entered into AVS by a State, the
authority of a State regulatory authority will be subject to OSM's program oversight authority under 30 CFR parts
733, 842, and 843. OSM relies primarily upon the States to determine whether State violations have been abated or not.
SMCRA section 510(c) explicitly states that an applicant must demonstrate that any current violation ``has been
corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or
agency which has jurisdiction over such violation *&blank;*&blank;*'' See also 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, where State ownership or control information has not yet become part of AVS, the information has not yet entered
the Federal information stream and has not yet become OSM's immediate responsibility. Such information is, in effect,
still the primary responsibility of the State regulatory authority and potentially subject to correction through
procedures of the State regulatory program. If correct information fails to enter the AVS, that may represent a weakness
of the regulatory authority's decisionmaking process. Accordingly, that process may require review. With respect
to the State's decisionmaking process, principles of primacy require that OSM review State actions in these matters
in accordance with OSM's program oversight under parts 733, 842, and 843. In the exercise of program oversight however,
it is also probable that OSM would review particular decisions with a view to determining whether the State regulatory
authority complied with the provisions of its approved program. Accordingly, in the event that a State determines
not to enter an ownership or control link into AVS, OSM will review such decision when it has reason to believe, through
information provided in a citizen's complaint or otherwise, that the State's ownership or control decision is arbitrary,
capricious, or an abuse of discretion under the State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In final &sect;773.25, OSM has deleted language contained in the proposed rule which would have provided that when
OSM disagreed with the decisions of State regulatory authorities, OSM would take action, as appropriate, under &sect;843.24,
oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations. This language
has been deleted for two reasons. First, the proposed language was redundant. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of final &sect;773.25
already provides that State regulatory authorities' decisions are subject to OSM's oversight under parts 733, 842,
and 843 of 30 CFR. As a section of part 843, the provisions of final &sect;843.24 would thus be applicable under appropriate
circumstances. Further, the agency was concerned that additional language specifically requiring OSM to take action
under final &sect;843.24 could somehow be construed as a limiting factor on OSM's authority to take action under parts
733 or 842 or under other sections of part 843 as provided by previous paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or 773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of final &sect;773.25 establishes evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and informal review
of ownership or control links and the status of violations. The provisions of the final section are substantively
similar to the provisions of the comparable provisions of the proposed rule. Certain minor changes described below
have been made to the proposal.

Paragraph (c)(1) of final &sect;773.25 provides that in any formal or informal review of an ownership or control link
or of the status of a violation covered by a violation notice, the agency responsible for making a decision is required
to first make a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists, existed during the relevant period, and/or
that the violation remains outstanding. The language ``existed during the relevant period'' has been added to the
final rule to clarify that, even when a person is not a current owner or controller of a surface coal mining operation,
a previous ownership or control link to that operation may be the basis for permit denial where the surface coal mining
operation has an outstanding violation and that violation had its inception during the previous period of ownership
or control. The requirement of a prima facie determination or prima facie showing is satisfied by evidence presented
establishing a presumption of ownership or control. A prima facie determination is made when the agency is reviewing
the evidence itself, in an informal process; a prima facie showing is made when the agency's determination is the subject
of a formal administrative or judicial review process. When the agency makes such a determination or showing, the
person seeking to challenge the link or the status of the violation than has the burden of proving the necessary elements
of his or her challenge to the link or to the status of the violation by a preponderance of the evidence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, in the comparable provision of the proposed rule, the rule language referred to the evidentiary standards applicable
to the review of ownership or control links ``to a person cited in a violation notice.'' The final rule has been changed
to reflect that these standards will be applicable to the review of an ownership or control link, without regard to
whether such relationship involves a link to an outstanding violation. The rationale for such a change has been explained
previously in this preamble in the discussion of a similar change made in paragraph (a)(1) of this final rule section.
As in the proposed rule, where there is a link to a violation, these evidentiary standards will apply to the review of
the status of a violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of final &sect;773.25, requires a challenger of an ownership or control link to prove at least one
of three proposed conclusions by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25, a challenger can demonstrate that the facts relied upon by the responsible
agency to prove ownership or control under the definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' contained
in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist. The final regulation differs from the comparable provision of the proposed regulation
in that while the final regulation refers to 30 CFR 773.5, it does not specifically cite particular paragraphs of 30
CFR 773.5 defining presumed and deemed relationships of ownership or control. On June 28, 1993, OSM proposed rules
which, if adopted, would modify the organization of regulatory language in 30 CFR 773.5. See Proposed Rule, 58 Fed.
Reg. 34652 (June 28, 1993). By changing the language in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25 to delete references
to the current paragraph organization of 30 CFR 773.5, OSM retains the flexibility to adopt or reject its rule proposal
of June 28, 1993, without having to further modify final &sect;773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that a person challenging a presumption of ownership or control
can prove that the person subject to the presumption does not and did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine
the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. The final rule deletes a reference contained in
the proposed rule to the paragraph (d) of the proposed rule which provided the required proof for the rebuttal of ownership
or control presumptions. As indicated above, that portion of the proposed rule has been withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that a challenger can prove that the violation covered by a
violation notice did not exist, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good
faith appeal within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The final rule provides that a person challenging the status
of a violation under &sect;773.24 will not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited
unless such challenge is made by a permittee within the context of &sect;&sect;773.20&hyph;773.21 of this part.
As indicated previously, the proposed rule did not explicitly allow challenge of the existence of the violation by
a permittee within the context of improvident permit issuance. The proposed rule also did not include the words ``at
the time it was cited'' with respect to the concept ``existence of the violation.'' The final rule has provided such
clarification. Also, references to proposed &sect;773.25, procedures for challenging ownership or control links
prior to entry in AVS, have been deleted. In addition, while no further substantive change has been made to the text
of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final &sect;773.25, some editing has been done to clarify the parallel construction
of the regulatory text.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of final &sect;773.25, the existence of the violation at the time it was cited could also be challenged
in a proceeding under 30 CFR part 775 (involving administrative or judicial appeals of permitting decisions), unless
the challenger has failed to take timely advantage of a prior opportunity to litigate the violation or is bound by a
previous administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, certain minimal changes have been made to the proposed rule with respect to the submission of documents
in the proof of challenges. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that certified
copies of corporate documents and certified copies of documents filed with or issued by State, Municipal, or Federal
government agencies could be submitted. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of final &sect;773.25 clarify
that copies of such documents can be submitted only ``if certified.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final &sect;773.25 provides for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in
support of his or her position. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary
materials; when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and
when counsel states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel
states that such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true.

. In the September, 1991 proposed rule package, OSM proposed this section which would have required that the regulatory
authority engage in periodic review of a permitted site to assure that basic ownership and control information contained
in the current official record of the permit was and remains complete and accurate. Subsequent to the publication
of that proposal, OSM published a modified version of such proposal as part of a comprehensive rule proposal designed
to address permit information requirements; ownership or control; and the transfer, assignment and sale of permit
rights. See 58 FR 34652, 34666 (June 28, 1993). OSM intends to address the proposed rule within the context of the subsequent
rulemaking. Accordingly, OSM defers any decision with respect to this proposed rule.

 In the September, 1991 proposal, OSM proposed to revise the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of then current 30
CFR 778.13 to clarify that permit applicants would be required to disclose relevant information with respect to both
``deemed'' and ``presumed'' owners or controllers within the meaning of the definitions of ``owned or controlled''
and ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5 (a) and (b), respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of that proposal, OSM published a new proposed amendment to 30 CFR 778.13 as part of the
comprehensive rule proposal cited above which was designed to address permit information requirements; ownership
or control; and the transfer, assignment and sale of permit rights. See 58 FR 34652, 34668 (June 28, 1993). Accordingly,
OSM hereby defers any decision with respect to the amendments proposed to 30 CFR 778.13 in today's rulemaking. Instead,
OSM will address proposed amendments to 30 CFR 778.13 within the context of that subsequent proposal.

Section 778.14_Violation information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment would have provided that the introductory language in paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 778.14 be amended
to require a permit applicant to disclose all violation notices received by the applicant within the preceding three
years. In addition, such introductory language would have been amended to require the disclosure of all outstanding
violation notices for any surface coal mining operation that is deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by either
the applicant or by any person who is deemed or presumed to own or control the applicant under definitions of ``owned
or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation to be amended required the applicant to disclose violations of various laws listed in 30 CFR 778.14(c).
Use of the proposed amended definition of ``violation notice'' from 30 CFR 773.5 would have obviated the need for such
a list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation to be amended further required that the applicant provide only a list of unabated cessation orders
and unabated air and water quality violation notices received prior to the date of the application by any surface coal
mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls
the applicant. With respect to this second list, that regulation did not require that an applicant list notices of
violation received or unpaid penalties or fees incurred by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled
by the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant.

Moreover, in litigation relating to &sect;&sect;778.14, 773.15(b)(1), and related matters before the U.S. District
Court of the District of Columbia, the Secretary advised the court that he had decided to reconsider &sect;778.14(c).
The Secretary stated that he intended to propose a regulation ``which considers the extent to which violation information
should be reported concerning owners and controllers of applicants as well as entities owned or controlled by the
applicant.'' See

Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary Judgment, footnote 33, at
page 90.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the representation made to the court, the proposed amendment to paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14 would
have required an applicant to disclose all outstanding violation notices received by any surface coal mining operation
that was deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by either the applicant or any person who was deemed or presumed
to own or control the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing members of the coal industry expressed concern over the proposed amendment to 30 CFR 778.14(c)
for essentially three reasons. They asserted that the proposed amendment impermissibly expanded the types of violations
which must be reported by an applicant by incorporating the newly amended definition of ``violation notice'' as the
basis for reporting; that the proposal inappropriately expanded the definition of ``owners or controllers'' which
must be reported; and that the proposal inappropriately expanded the type of information required for operations
linked through ownership or control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' assertions. First, the proposed regulation does incorporate the new definition
of the term ``violation notice'' which had been proposed, and has now been adopted, in &sect;773.5. The new definition
of violation notice, however, is not overly broad. In this preamble, OSM has already responded to similar comments
made with respect to this definition in the section of this preamble captioned ``Section 773.5_Definitions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By incorporating the amended definition of ``violation notice,'' the proposed amendment to paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14
would have incorporated the list and types of violations which are relevant to a regulatory authority's decision
whether to issue a permit under section 510(c) of the Act and under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). In contrast
to this, the unamended version of the regulation did not require that an applicant list unpaid penalties or fees incurred
by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant.
Accordingly, the proposed amendment would expand what has to be reported to enable the regulatory authority to have
necessary information to make its decision. It is entirely appropriate to require that a permit applicant report
such information to the regulatory authority so that the regulatory authority can make an informed decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, commenters further asserted that the proposal inappropriately expanded the definition of ``owners
or controllers'' by requiring the reporting of all outstanding violations received prior to the date of permit applications
by surface coal mining operations deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by the applicant or by any person who
owns or controls the applicant. The commenters asserted that this placed the applicant in an untenable position.
OSM disagrees with this assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if 30 CFR 778.14(c) would not be amended by the proposal, the regulation already required the reporting of violations
of surface coal mining operations which the applicant is deemed or presumed to own or control under the provisions
of 30 CFR 773.5. Such reporting is required even if the applicant believes that he or she can rebut the presumption of
ownership or control. The permit application is not forced to admit ownership or control. On the contrary, such reporting
can be done by an applicant who, at the same time, reserves his or her rights to deny ownership or control. Even under
current law, the applicant must disclose violations incident to the presumed ownership or control relationship
so that the regulatory authority can evaluate this information. Thus, the amendment would just clarify what the regulation
already does. Therefore, the amendment has not inappropriately expanded the definition of what constitutes surface
coal mining operations owned or controlled by the applicant.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters further asserted that the proposal inappropriately expanded the type of information required for operations
linked through ownership or control. In substance, the commenters argued that the proposed regulation is overbroad
and vague in requiring the reporting of ``all outstanding violation notices'' received prior to the date of application
which are linked, through ownership or control, to the applicant. Again, OSM disagrees with the commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed previously in this preamble with respect to &sect;773.25 of the final rule, an ``outstanding violation''
is one which is currently in violation of the Act or of other laws specified in &sect;510(c) of the Act. Under the proposed
amendment to 30 CFR 778.14(d), an ``outstanding violation notice'' is a written notification from a governmental
entity advising of a violation which remains uncorrected. Such violations are the basis for permit denial unless
an applicant can demonstrate that the violation is in the process of being corrected or is the subject of a good faith
appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). It is reasonable to require, prior to the date of application, that
a permit applicant disclose such violations to the regulatory authority with respect to surface coal mining operations
to which it is linked through ownership or control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed amendment should be modified to require only the reporting of violations
which would subject an applicant to permit block. OSM considers this proposal to be too restrictive. For instance,
under commenter's proposal, an applicant correcting a violation to the satisfaction of the agency which has jurisdiction
over such violation would not report such violation at the time of application. Nevertheless, any permit to be issued
should be conditioned upon the performance of the corrective work being accomplished. Absent the reporting of such
violation by the applicant, a regulatory authority might overlook the violation and issue the permit unconditioned
upon such performance. The same rationale would apply with respect to the reporting of violations which are the subject
of good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Accordingly, OSM must reject the proposed change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters asserted that requiring such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure by large companies with multiple affiliates and multiple surface coal mining operations is overly burdensome.
OSM believes that companies which own or control surface coal mining operations should be aware of the compliance
status of such operations. If companies choose to engage in surface coal mining operations, they should also have
the capability of monitoring such operations. It is reasonable to require the disclosure of outstanding violations.
Thus, OSM disagrees with the commenters' assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM intends to further address the issues of compliance under 30 CFR 778.13 and 778.14. In a recently
proposed rule package of June 28, 1993, OSM proposed the streamlining of companies' reporting under 30 CFR 778.13
and 778.14 through the use of information already incorporated into AVS. See 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (June 28, 1993). Further, OSM's AVS Office stands ready to work with companies in the development of methods to report
such companies' ownership or control relationships and to track the compliance of surface coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated previously in the preamble discussion of final section 773.15, OSM has decided to retain a limited presumption
that notices of violation are in the process of being abated for purposes of a regulatory authority's review of a permit
application. OSM made this decision as result of comments received in response to its proposed rules. Accordingly,
OSM has amended paragraph (b)(1) of final &sect;773.15 to provide that a regulatory authority may presume, in the
absence of a cessation order, that a notice of violation is in the process of abatement if certain conditions are present.
These conditions include that the abatement period for the notice of violation has not yet expired and that the applicant
has provided certification that such violation is in the process of being corrected to the agency with jurisdiction
over the violation as part of the violation information provided pursuant to &sect;778.14. In accordance with that
change made to final &sect;773.15, OSM has added language to paragraph (c) of final &sect;778.14 requiring that an
applicant provide such certification along with his or her disclosure of violations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September, 1991, proposal, OSM proposed to amend the Table of Contents of 30 CFR part 843 to add, in numerical
order, the proposed regulations for the Federal enforcement of the proposed AVS-related regulations. The proposed
additions would have included &sect;843.23, sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control
and violation information, and &sect;843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership
or control of the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the proposed additions to the Table of Contents, OSM proposed a modified version
of 843.23 as part of a separate rulemaking. See Proposed Rule, 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (June 28, 1993). OSM has deferred action on the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 for that later rulemaking. Since
action on proposed &sect;843.23 has been deferred, OSM will not adopt a reference to &sect;843.23 for inclusion in
the Table of Contents at this time. If a final version of 843.23 is adopted, a reference to the section will be added to
the Table of Contents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The September, 1991, proposal would have removed existing section 843.10 since part 843 did not contain any information
collection requirements which required the approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
The references to &sect;843.14(c) and 843.16 in existing 843.10 did not represent information collection requirements.
The requirements in &sect;843.14(c) for OSM to furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority
and to any person having an interest did not require OMB approval because the obligation to provide the information
was imposed upon OSM and not upon the State or upon a member of the public. Section 843.16 merely informed the public
of the right to file an application for review and request a hearing under 43 CFR part 4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;843.23 was designed to respond to those circumstances in which there had been a knowing failure to
provide the regulatory authority with complete and accurate ownership and control or violation information in an
application or other document submitted pursuant to parts 773 and 778 of Title 30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;843.23 was designed ``to carry out the purposes'' of sections 507(b)(4), 510(b), 510(c), and 518(g)
of SMCRA. The proposed section was designed to deter and punish the intentional failure to provide the complete and
accurate ownership and control information required by sections 507(b)(4) and 510 (b)&hyph;(c) of the Act. It would
have further implemented the criminal provisions of section 518(g) where appropriate.

As has been discussed previously in this preamble, OSM has allowed references to &sect;843.23 to remain in various
sections of some of the other final rules adopted today in the event that a final &sect;843.23 is adopted. That such
references have been allowed to remain, however, does not constitute a prejudgment by OSM to ultimately adopt proposed
&sect;843.23 or some version of that rule. Any decision of this type will be made within the context of the subsequent
rulemaking.

Section 843.24_Oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided standards for OSM's oversight of State permitting decisions with respect
to ownership or control or the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have established the bases which would have required OSM to have taken
action under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of proposed &sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided that OSM would have been required to take action whenever
it determined, through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State had issued a permit without
complying with the State program equivalents of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control
application information), 773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures
for challenging ownership or control links in AVS), 773.26 (standards for challenging ownership or control links
and the status of violations), and 843.23 (sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control
and violation information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided that OSM would have been required to take action whenever
it had determined, through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State had failed in a systemic
manner to comply with the State program equivalent of proposed &sect;773.27 (periodic check of ownership or control
information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have defined ``failure to comply in a systemic manner'' to include
a continuing pattern of noncompliance by a State, or one of more instances of noncompliance that result from or evidence
a legal or policy decision which the State intended to apply to similar cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;843.24, a State's isolated failure to comply with proposed &sect;773.27 (periodic
check of ownership and control information) would have been treated differently from isolated failures to comply
with the proposed regulations listed in paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have required OSM to initiate action under 30 CFR 843.21 if, as a result
of the determination made under paragraph (a) of the proposed section, OSM had reason to believe that the State had
issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided for remedial actions by OSM against a State which did not
comply with the proposed regulations relating to ownership or control and violation information during the permit
application process. Such actions would have been applied where the State had knowingly failed to comply with the
State program equivalents of sections 773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information),
773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership
or control links in AVS), 773.26 (standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations),
or 843.23 (sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information),
or where the State had failed in a systemic manner to comply with &sect;773.27 (periodic check of ownership and control
information).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulation, the remedial actions against a non-complying State could have included grant reduction
or termination under 30 CFR 735.21 or 30 CFR 886.18 and the substitution of Federal enforcement or other action pursuant
to 30 CFR 733.12(b). Such remedial actions would not have been used where the State's actions were mandated by court
order or where the State had not knowingly failed to comply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing environmental advocacy groups expressed concern that proposed &sect;843.24 did not expressly
provide that citizens could petition OSM to take enforcement action where they had reason to believe that violations
of the sections subject to &sect;843.24 exist. OSM recognizes commenter's concern about citizen participation
and has addressed that issue in some detail above in this preamble in the section captioned ``Citizen Participation.''
The analysis in that section of the preamble is generally applicable to proposed &sect;843.24. For reasons similar
to those expressed in that section of the preamble, OSM must reject commenter's proposal to explicitly modify the
proposed rule at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until these matters are addressed directly by further proposal of the agency, citizens could, however, assert their
rights in a number of ways in accordance with the provisions of proposed &sect;843.24. With respect to specific permits
under paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24, concerned citizens could assert their complaints within the context
of 30 CFR 842.11, 842.12, 842.15, and 843.21. With respect to more global remedies such as the reduction of State grants
or the termination or the substitution of Federal enforcement provided by paragraph (c) of proposed &sect; 843.24,
OSM could accept and review information submitted by citizens with a view to determining whether such remedies were
appropriate under the circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also took issue with the provision of paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24 in that such provision
would have provided that OSM take action under the provisions of 30 CFR 843.21 if OSM had reason to believe that a State
had issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20. The commenter questioned the legality of 30
CFR 773.20 and 843.21 and asserted that these improvidently issued permit rules violated SMCRA. OSM disagrees with
commenter's criticisms. OSM considers these rules to be legal. OSM incorporates by reference the arguments that
the Department has made defending such rules in briefs filed in the case of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities questioned the provision of paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24
which stated that a State regulatory authority would be excused from a failure to comply with the State program equivalents
of the AVS-related regulations if such non-compliance was the result of a ``mandatory injunction.'' The commenter
asked for clarification of this term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulation, a mandatory injunction would be an order to a regulatory authority by a court with jurisdiction
over which the regulatory authority has no control. Such an order would have the effect of ordering or otherwise preventing
the regulatory authority from complying with the provisions of the regulations cited in paragraph (c) of proposed
&sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing a State regulatory authority indicated approval of the requirement contained in paragraph
(c) of proposed &sect;843.24 that a State's failure to comply with proposed &sect;&sect;773.22, 773.23, 773.24,
773.26, and 843.23 be a ``knowing'' failure, before sanctions could be imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees with commenter and has retained the ``knowing'' standard in paragraph (c) of the final rule adopted as described
below. The determination of what constitutes a State's ``knowing'' behavior would be made based upon a full consideration
of the facts. In substance, the issue would be whether the State knew or had reason to know that its actions constituted
a failure to comply with the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule, with certain modifications, as final rule &sect;843.24. The final
rule and the rationale behind such modifications are now described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, a reference to proposed &sect;773.26 has been deleted from among the
list of regulations with which a State must comply to avoid action by OSM. As discussed previously, proposed &sect;773.26
has been renumbered and adopted as final &sect;773.25. Accordingly, a reference to &sect;773.25 has been substituted
in paragraph (a) of final &sect;843.24. A similar substitution has also been made in paragraph (c) of the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, OSM has deleted subparagraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24. The proposed section would have required
action by OSM when OSM determined that a State had systemically failed to comply with proposed &sect;773.27, periodic
check of ownership or control information. As has been discussed previously, OSM is deferring action on proposed
&sect;773.27 as part of a subsequent rulemaking. See 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In dealing with a similar deferral with respect to proposed &sect;843.23 described above in this preamble, OSM was
able to allow references to proposed &sect;843.23 to remain in other final rules in the event of the ultimate adoption
of 843.23. If &sect;843.23 is ultimately not adopted, the references in the final rules to it will be mere surplusage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike those other references to proposed &sect;843.23, the references to proposed &sect;773.27 contained in final
&sect;843.24 are presented within a context of defining and applying a special standard, systemic noncompliance,
applicable only to a State's failure to comply with &sect;773.27. The rationale for adopting the particular standard
of systemic noncompliance is inextricably linked to the issue of whether the adoption of proposed &sect;773.27 is
appropriate. Accordingly, both issues will be appropriately addressed together in the separate rulemaking. Thus,
OSM has deleted all of subparagraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the provisions of paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have required OSM to initiate action under
&sect;&sect;735.21 or 886.18 and/or &sect;733.12 if OSM determined that a State had failed to comply in a systemic
manner with the State program equivalent to &sect;773.27. In the final &sect;843.24, OSM has deleted such language
for the reasons justifying a similar deletion of subparagraph (a)(2) of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM emphasizes that the deletion of this language does not indicate that OSM has made a prejudgment with respect to
the ultimate adoption of proposed &sect;773.27 or with respect to the issue of systemic noncompliance with respect
to such proposed section. These matters will be addressed in the subsequent rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, &sect;843.24 is adopted as modified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This rule will apply, through cross-referencing, in those States with Federal programs: California, Georgia, Idaho,
Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. The Federal
programs for these States appear at 30 CFR parts 905, 910, 912, 921, 922, 933, 937, 939, 941, 942, and 947, respectively.
The rule will also apply through cross-referencing to Indian lands as provided in 30 CFR part 750. No comments were
received concerning unique conditions in any of these Federal program states or on Indian lands which would require
changes to the national rules or as specific amendments to any or all of the Federal programs or the Indian lands program.

Effect of the Rule on State Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The provisions of section 503(a)(1) of the Act require that State laws regulating surface coal mining and reclamation
operations be ``in accordance with'' the requirements of the Act. Further, section 503(a)(7) of the Act requires
that State programs contain rules and regulations ``consistent with'' regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant
to the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These terms are defined at &sect;730.5 of title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations to require that State programs
contain procedures which are, with respect to the Act, no less stringent than the Act; and with respect to the Secretary's
regulations, no less effective than the Secretary's regulations in meeting the requirements of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following promulgation of this final rule, OSM will evaluate State programs to determine whether any changes in these
programs will be necessary. If the Director determines that any State program provisions should be amended to be made
no less effective than the revised Federal rules, the individual States will be notified in accordance with the provisions
of 30 CFR 732.17.

This rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice
Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble
discussion of this rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. What is the Preemptive Effect, if any, to be Given to the Regulation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy, States
have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth in OSM's
rules. Any State law that is inconsistent with, or that would preclude implementation of this proposed rule would
be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent that
the rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent State
laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the rule, however, administrative procedures must be exhausted.
In situations involving OSM application of the rule, applicable administrative procedures may be found at 43 CFR

links involving the applicant, including information obtained pursuant to &sect;&sect;773.22, 773.23, 778.13,
and 778.14 of this chapter, the regulatory authority shall not issue the permit if any surface coal mining and reclamation
operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant is currently
in violation of the Act, any Federal rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, a State program, or any Federal
or State law, rule, or regulation pertaining to air or water environmental protection. In the absence of a failure-to-abate
cessation order, the regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation issued pursuant to &sect;843.12
of this chapter or under a Federal or State program is being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction
over the violation where the abatement period for such notice of violation has not yet expired and where, as part of
the violation information provided pursuant to &sect;778.14 of this chapter, the applicant has provided certification
that such violation is in the process of being so corrected. Such presumption shall not apply where evidence to the
contrary is set forth in the permit application, or where the notice of violation is issued for nonpayment of abandoned
mine land reclamation fees or civil penalties. If a current violation exists, the regulatory authority shall require
the applicant or person who owns or controls the applicant, before the issuance of the permit, to either_

Review criteria.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A regulatory authority shall find that a surface coal mining and reclamation permit was improvidently issued
if_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Under the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The regulatory authority should not have issued the permit because of an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty
or fee; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The permit was issued on the presumption that a notice of violation was in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction
of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation, but a cessation order subsequently was issued; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The violation, penalty, or fee:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Remains unabated or delinquent; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is not the subject of a good faith appeal, or of an abatement plan or payment schedule with which the permittee or
other person responsible is complying to the satisfaction of the responsible agency; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Where the permittee was linked to the violation, penalty, or fee through ownership or control under the violations
review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued, an ownership or control link between the
permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee still exists, or where the link has been severed,
the permittee continues to be responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The provisions of &sect;773.25 of this part shall be applicable when a regulatory authority determines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time that it was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has
been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether any ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty,
or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remedial measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A regulatory authority which, under paragraph (b) of this section, finds that because of an unabated violation
or a delinquent penalty or fee a permit was improvidently issued shall use one or more of the following remedial measures:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Implement, with the cooperation of the permittee or other person responsible, and of the responsible agency,
a plan for abatement of the violation or a schedule for payment of the penalty or fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Impose on the permit a condition requiring that in a reasonable time the permittee or other person responsible
abate the violation or pay the penalty or fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Suspend the permit until the violation is abated or the penalty or fee is paid; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Rescind the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the regulatory authority decides to suspend the permit, it shall afford at least 30 days' written notice to the
permittee. If the regulatory authority decides to rescind the permit, it shall issue a notice in accordance with &sect;773.21
of this part. In either case, the permittee shall be given the opportunity to request administrative review of the
notice under 43 CFR 4.1370 through 4.1377, where OSM is the regulatory authority, or under the State program equivalent,
where a State is the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority's decision shall remain in effect during the
pendency of the appeal, unless temporary relief is granted in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1376 or the State program equivalent.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rulemaking amends regulations of the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) applicable to surface coal mining
hearings and appeals by adding procedural rules for administrative review of a decision by the Office of Surface Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to suspend or rescind permits that should not have been issued, and a decision by
OSM in response to (a) a challenge, by an applicant or other person shown in the Applicant Violator System, to a finding
that he or she is in an ownership or control link to any person or (b) a challenge, by an applicant or other person shown
in the Applicant Violator System in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a federal violation notice,
to the status of the violation in the notice. The final rulemaking provides for a hearing before an administrative
law judge and for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial decision by the Interior Board of
Land Appeals (IBLA). In addition, existing 43 CFR 4.1105(a)(2) is amended to include a reference to the rules added
by this rulemaking.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OHA's proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 6, 1991 (56 FR 45806&hyph;11). Proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 set forth new OHA procedures for reviewing
OSM decisions to suspend or rescind permits OSM finds were improvidently issued under 30 CFR 773.20. Proposed 43 CFR
4.1380&hyph;4.1387 set forth new OHA procedures for reviewing OSM decisions finding that a person is in an ownership
or control link to a person currently in violation of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA)
or other applicable law. In addition, OHA proposed to amend the existing rule that establishes OSM's burden of proof
in individual civil penalty proceedings, 43 CFR 3.1307(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 and 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 are based on section 510(c) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1260(c)
(1988). This section requires an applicant for a surface coal mining and reclamation permit to file with the permit
application a schedule listing all notices of violations of SMCRA and any law, rule, or regulation of the United States,
or of any department or agency in the United States pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred by
the applicant in connection with any surface coal mining operation during the three-year period prior to the date
of application. Where the schedule or other information indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or
controlled by the applicant is currently in violation of the Act or other air or water environmental protection laws,
the permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the
process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or agency which has jurisdiction
over such violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement section 510(c), OSM has promulgated a rule defining the words ``owned or controlled'' in that
section, as well as ``owns or controls.'' 30 CFR 773.5. It has adopted a rule requiring that an application for a permit
include information about each person who owns or controls the applicant, within the meaning of &sect;773.5, and
about any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or any person who owns or controls
the applicant. 30 CFR 778.13(c), (d). It has adopted a regulation concerning review of applications for permits that
provides: ``[b]ased on available information *&blank;*&blank;*, the regulatory authority shall not issue the
permit if any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person
who owns or controls the applicant is currently in violation of the Act or any other law, rule or regulation referred
to in this paragraph.'' 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). This is the so-called ``permit block,'' referring to the language in
section 510(c) that states ``the permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof'' that a violation of
a surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant has been corrected or is in the process of being
corrected. OSM has also established the Applicant/Violator System (AVS), a computerized system to store data regarding
violations and ownership and control links to those violations. See

OHA's proposed rules were published on the same day as OSM proposed related rules defining the AVS, requiring its use
in reviewing permit applications to determine whether there are any ownership or control links between applicants
and persons in violation, and proposing procedures and standards for an applicant or other person shown in the AVS
to challenge ownership and control links shown in the AVS and the status of the violation. 56 FR 45780&hyph;45804 (Sept.
6, 1991). OSM also proposed to amend its existing rules governing suspension and rescission of improvidently issued
permits. OSM's proposed rules provided a right to review of its decisions to suspend or rescind a permit under the procedures
set forth in OHA's proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1370 through 4.1377. See proposed &sect;773.20(c)(2), 56 FR
45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). OSM's proposed rules also provided a right to review of its written decisions on challenges
to ownership and control links and the status of violations shown in the AVS under the procedures set forth in OHA's
proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1380 through 4.1387. See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2)(ii), 56 FR 45800 (Sept.
6, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OHA received comments on its proposed rules from Texas Utilities Services, Inc. (TU Services), the Joint National
Coal Association/American Mining Congress Committee on Surface Mining Regulations (NCA/AMC), and the National
Wildlife Federation (NWF). The NCA/AMC comments dealt with both OHA's and OSM's proposed rules.

Proposed Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) Withdrawn
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its September 6, 1991, proposed rulemaking, OHA proposed an amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) at 56 FR 45808
which set forth an element of OSM's prima facie case in proceedings to review the assessment of individual civil penalties.
Proposed 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) complemented proposed rules by OSM at 56 FR 48924, 48929&hyph;30 (Sept. 26, 1991) addressing
individual civil penalties. Both TU Services' and NCA/AMC's comments expressed reservations about the proposed
amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). By a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on October 16, 1992, OSM withdrew its September 26, 1991, proposed rulemaking. 57 FR 47431 (Oct. 16, 1992). Therefore,
OHA hereby withdraws the corresponding proposed amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). Because this proposed rule concerning
an element of OSM's prima facie case in individual civil penalty proceedings is withdrawn, no response to the comments
concerning it is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the NCA/AMC comments address both the proposed OSM rules and the proposed OHA rules ``[b]ecause [their]
comments on the proposal by [OHA] are interrelated with [their] concerns about the OSM proposal.'' NCA/AMC's comments
that relate to the procedures for administrative review are addressed here.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedural Due Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCA/AMC state that although the proposed rules ``purport to establish a comprehensive scheme for administrative
review of ownership and control determinations emanating from the AVS, they fall far short of providing the meaningful
guarantees that the due process clause requires.'' They fall short, NCA/AMC state, because the procedures do not
allow one to challenge the existence of the violation that forms the basis for a permit block under section 510(c).
Further, the proposed rules do not provide ``any opportunity for challenging either the status of the violation or
the validity of the AVS link 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prior 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to the deprivation of the operator's property interest through permit denial, suspension, or revocation, unless
the applicant is able to meet the stringent requirements for seeking temporary relief'' contained in proposed 43
CFR 4.1386 (emphasis in original). NCA/AMC state that the ``right to notice and a hearing prior to a governmental deprivation
of private property is a cornerstone of American jurisprudence, and is a well-established principle in cases involving
the constitutionality of SMCRA provisions'' that the proposed rules fail to recognize. NCA/AMC state that an appeal
or challenge to AVS information ``must, of necessity, include the right to a full and fair determination on the merits
of the violation in advance of any decision to prohibit mining through the sanctions contained within section 510(c).''

, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), the proposed rules do not afford due process, NCA/AMC argue.

A fundamental requirement of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that ``[n]o person shall

heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

[O]ur prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration
of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk
of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional
or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved
and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.

, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), the Supreme Court decided procedural due process requires that a state grant an evidentiary
hearing before suspending or terminating welfare payments to an individual who meets the statutory qualifications
for receiving them. ``[T]he crucial factor in this context,'' the Court observed, ``is that termination of aid pending
resolution of a controversy over eligibility may deprive an

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the procedures proposed for OSM decisions and for OHA administrative review of those decisions provide adequate
due process protection of the interests involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules recognize a distinction between a person who holds a permit that might be suspended or rescinded
because OSM determines it was improvidently issued (43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377) and a person who has applied for a
permit or might apply for one in the future (43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387). A person who holds a permit is entitled to more
protection than the person who has applied for one or plans to do so. In recognition of this distinction, OSM's final
rule 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2) will provide, for a person who has a permit, that OSM will determine whether a violation, penalty
or fee existed when it was cited and whether an ownership or control link between a permittee and the person responsible
for the violation existed, still exists, or has been severed, before issuing a notice to suspend or rescind a permit.
An applicant for a permit, however, may challenge the existence of a violation in a review proceeding under 43 CFR 4.1360&hyph;4.1369
after the application has been denied, not before. An applicant (or any other person shown in the AVS) may challenge
an ownership or control link or the status of a violation before a permit application is denied, or even filed, under
proposed 30 CFR 773.24, as discussed further below. (The ``status of a violation'' concerns whether the violation
remains outstanding, has been or is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of an administrative or judicial
appeal. The status of a violation is distinct from ``the existence of a violation,'' i.e., whether the violation existed
at the time it was cited.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``private interest that will be affected,'' i.e., a permit, is limited. A permit is issued for a five-year term
(with a right of renewal unless its terms or other requirements are not being met), 30 U.S.C. 1256(b), (d) (1988), and
is conditioned on compliance with several performance standards, 30 U.S.C. 1265(a) (1988). It may be terminated,
revised, reviewed, suspended, or revoked. 30 U.S.C. 1256(c), 1261(c), 1265(c), 1271(a)(4) (1988). Thus, while
valuable, a permit to conduct surface coal mining is not a private interest comparable to the welfare benefits in

 at 343, the Supreme Court held that termination of disability payments may be effected without a pretermination evidentiary
hearing. Similarly, suspension or rescission of a surface coal mining permit does not require a prior hearing in addition
to the other procedural safeguards provided in the OSM and OHA rules.

Those rules significantly reduce ``the risk of an erroneous deprivation'' of a permit. If OSM finds a permit was improvidently
issued because at the time it was issued one or more of the circumstances set forth in the review criteria in 30 CFR 773.20(b)(1)
existed, it does so in accordance with the standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations
in proposed 30 CFR 773.26, 56 FR 45801&hyph;45803 (Sept. 6, 1991). See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept.
6, 1991). As mentioned above, these standards will apply, under OSM's final rule 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2), to a determination
whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time it was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has been or is
in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of an appeal, and whether an ownership or control link between the
permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.
OSM has a choice of four remedial measures if it finds a permit was improvidently issued, including suspension or rescission
of the permit. 30 CFR 773.20(c); see proposed &sect;773.20(c)(1), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). If it decides to suspend,
it will give the permittee 30 days written notice and inform the permittee of its right to review under 43 CFR 4.1370

 See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). If it decides to rescind, it will issue the permittee

was improvidently issued and will inform the permittee of its right to review under 43 CFR 4.1370

Under OHA's proposed rules 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377, the permittee may file a request for review with OHA that includes
OSM's notice; documentary proof or offers of proof concerning the &sect;773.20(b) review criteria (or their analogues
in &sect;773.21(a)(1)&hyph;(4)); other relevant information; a request for specific relief; and a request for
an evidentiary hearing. &sect;4.1372. The permittee may amend its request for review once as a matter of right before
OSM files a response and may also do so afterwards with leave of the administrative law judge. The administrative law
judge is to convene the hearing within 90 days of receiving responses to the request (unless the parties waive this
deadline); this gives the parties an opportunity to conduct discovery under 43 CFR 4.1130&hyph;4.1141. &sect;4.1373.
The administrative law judge must issue an initial decision within 30 days of the date the hearing record is closed.
&sect;4.1375. OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie case in support of its notice while the person
requesting review has the ultimate burden of persuasion that the notice is in error. &sect;4.1374. Any party may file
a petition for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial decision with IBLA. The petition shall
attach a copy of this decision and specify the alleged errors. Other parties have 30 days to file responses, after which
IBLA shall issue a decision within 60 days denying the petition or granting it and deciding the merits. &sect;4.1377.

OSM's proposed rule provides that its decision to suspend or rescind will remain in effect during the time a request
for review is pending in OHA unless temporary relief is granted in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1376. 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2),
56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). Proposed 43 CFR 4.1376 provides that with a request for review_or at any time before the
administrative law judge issues the initial decision_any party may petition for temporary relief from OSM's notice
of suspension or notice of proposed suspension and rescission. Under &sect;4.1376, the petition must show that the
petitioner has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and that the relief it seeks will not adversely
affect public health or safety or cause significant, imminent environmental harm. Other parties have 5 days to file
responses. The administrative law judge must hold a hearing within 10 days of the filing of the responses if a hearing
has been requested and must issue a decision granting or denying temporary relief within 5 days of the date of the hearing,
or the filing of the responses if no hearing is held. If all parties have been notified of the petition and given an opportunity
to respond (and a hearing has been held if requested), the administrative law judge may grant temporary relief if the
petitioner has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and the relief will not adversely
affect public health or safety or cause significant, imminent environmental harm. These standards are based on those
contained in 30 U.S.C. 1275(c) (1988). As noted in the preamble to the proposed regulations, 56 FR at 45807 (Sept. 6,
1991), the focus of the adverse effect inquiry would be on the permitted operation rather than operation allegedly
in violation. Any party may appeal the administrative law judge's decision granting or denying temporary relief
to IBIA, which shall decide the appeal expeditiously, or may seek judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OHA believes ``the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards''_in particular,
an evidentiary hearing before a decision to suspend or rescind is effective_is minimal. As in

at 343&hyph;345, although the definition of ownership and control in 30 CFR 773.5 includes elements or judgment where
witness credibility and veracity will sometimes play a role (e.g., &sect;&sect;773.5(a)(3), 773.5(b)(6)), the
determination is usually made on the basis of documents, such as instruments of ownership or voting securities, or
on the basis of readily and often publicly documentable circumstances such as a person's status as an officer or director
of an entity, the permittee or operator of a surface coal mining operation, or a general partner in a parternship (e.g.,
&sect;&sect;773.5(a)(1)&hyph;(2), 773.5(b)(1)&hyph;(2), (4)&hyph;(5)). Further, a permittee receives sufficient
notice of OSM's decision to suspend a permit (30 days under proposed &sect;773.20(c)(2)) or rescind a permit (up to
180 days under &sect;773.21) to enable it to request review by an administrative law judge before the decision becomes
effective. The provisions in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377 imposing short time frames for each step of review
significantly reduce delay due to ``the torpidity of [the] administrative review process,''

at 342, especially if temporary relief is sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Government's interest'' is to effectively implement section 510(c), specifically, to ensure that no person
in violation of SMCRA or the other specified environmental laws obtains or retains a permit to conduct surface mining
operations until the violation is corrected or in the process of being corrected. The Department's goal of achieving
compliance with these laws would be significantly burdened if it were required to provide an evidentiary hearing
before OSM could decide to suspend or rescind a permit because the person should not have received the permit when it
was issued. It was OSM's experience in 1992&hyph;93 that providing informal review by OSM of the proposed entry into
the AVS of information concerning ownership or control links became very time-and-personnel-consuming. For 105
cases in 1993, for example, OSM spent more than 11,000 hours from after investigating an ownership or control link
to issuing its final decision, a mean of 105 hours per case. It would be even more costly to require an evidentiary hearing
before a permit was suspended or rescinded; meanwhile, mining would continue while alleged outstanding violations
existed.

permit is suspended or rescinded.

As noted above, OSM's proposed rules also provide that an applicant for a permit or any other person that is shown in
the AVS as having an ownership or control link to a person may challenge the link (unless the applicant or other person
is bound by an earlier administrative or judicial decision concerning the link). See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(1),
56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). An applicant or any other person shown in the AVS may also challenge the status of the violation
cited in a federal violation notice naming a person with whom the applicant or other person is linked (unless bound
by a decision concerning the status of the violation). See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(2), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991).
The applicant or other person may submit a written explanation and supporting evidence to OSM concerning the existence
of the link or the status of the violation. See proposed &sect;773.24(b), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). Applying the
standards for challenging ownership and control links and the status of violations contained in proposed &sect;773.26,
56 FR 45801&hyph;03 (Sept. 6, 1991), OSM will either correct the information in the AVS, if the applicant or other person
shows the link is erroneous or the violation is no longer outstanding, or, if this is not shown, OSM will so notify the
applicant or other person. See proposed &sect;773.24(d), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). In either event, OSM will issue
a written decision and serve it by certified mail. See proposed &sect;&sect;773.24(d)(2)(i), 56 FR 45800&hyph;01
(Sept. 6, 1991). The applicant or other person has a right to request review within 30 days of service of OSM's decision
under the procedures proposed by OHA in 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387. OSM's decision remains in effect pending a decision
on review unless temporary relief is granted under proposed &sect;4.1386. See proposed &sect;773.24(d)(2)(ii),
56 FR 45801 (Sept. 6, 1991).

OHA's procedures in proposed 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 closely parallel those in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377.
Any person who receives a written OSM decision concerning a challenge to the existence of a link or the status of a violation
may request review. &sect;4.1381. The required contents of the request are set forth in proposed &sect;4.1382; the
request may be amended once as a matter of right before a response is filed by OSM and with the leave of an administrative
law judge thereafter. &sect;4.1382(c). The administrative law judge is to convene a hearing within 90 days of receipt
of the responses unless the parties waive that deadline, and give notice at least 10 days in advance of the hearing.
&sect;4.1383. OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie case in support of its decision, while the
person requesting review has the ultimate burden of persuasion that the decision is in error. &sect;4.1384. An initial
decision is required within 30 days after the record of the hearing is closed. &sect;4.1385. At any time before the
initial decision is issued, any party may file a petition for temporary relief from OSM's decision. Temporary relief
may be granted if all parties to the proceeding have been notified of the petition, have had an opportunity to respond,
and a hearing has been held if requested; and if the petitioner has demonstrated that it has a substantial likelihood
of prevailing on the merits and that temporary relief will not adversely affect public health or safety or cause significant,
imminent environmental harm. &sect;4.1386. Expedited review by IBLA or judicial review of a decision granting or
denying temporary relief may be requested within 30 days of receipt of the decision. &sect;4.1386(h). If temporary
relief is not requested, any party may file a petiton for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial
decision within 30 days of receiving it. &sect;4.1387. The Board is to issue a decision denying the petition or granting
it and ruling on the merits within 60 days of the deadline for filing responses to the petition section 4.1387(d).

The nature of a person's interest in an application for a permit cannot be regarded as a ``legitimate claim of entitlement''
to a permit and therefore requires less due process protection than the interest of a person who holds a permit that
is subject to suspension or rescission because it was improvidently issued. See

408 U.S. 564, 569&hyph;71, 577 (1972). For a person who has applied for a permit or may apply for one, due process does
not require a hearing on the existence of an ownership or control link or on the existence of a violation when it was cited
before OSM issues a decision under proposed 30 CFR 773.24. If the proposed procedures in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377
for administrative review of notices of permit suspension or rescission under proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) provide
adequate due process protection, as OHA believes, then the parallel procedures in proposed &sect;&sect;4.1380&hyph;4.1387
certainly satisfy due process requirements for OSM's decisions regarding ownership and control links or the status
of a violation under proposed 30 CFR 773.24. In particular, an applicant's opportunity to obtain temporary relief
under 43 CFR 4.1386 from an OSM decision provides sufficient due process at this stage. Further administrative review
is available to an applicant for a permit in an appeal of the denial of the application under existing procedures in
43 CFR 4.1360 through 4.1369, when the existence of the violation may be challenged. Providing an evidentiary hearing
before OSM decisions under proposed 30 CFR 773.24 would severely impede the Department's effective implementation
of section 510(c).

is based on information contained within the AVS. *&blank;*&blank;* Additionally, OSM and OHA propose to require
that any appeals from decisions on the ownership and control presumptions be made before the OHA in accordance with

The regulatory authority in a state that has been delegated primacy under section 503 will retain its authority to
issue permits. Information in the AVS is ``other information available to the regulatory authority,'' within the
meaning of section 510(c), that a state regulatory authority must use in deciding whether or not issuance of a permit
should be blocked. The state regulatory authority's decision is its own_subject, of course, to OSM oversight. See
30 U.S.C. 1202(g), 1211(c), 1253, 1254, 1255, and 1271.

An applicant or other person shown in the AVS in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a state violation
notice may challenge the status of the violation in that notice under the state program equivalents to proposed 30
CFR 773.24(b)&hyph;(d) and 773.26. See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(3), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). Similarly, decisions
by a state regulatory authority to suspend or rescind a permit are reviewed by the State program equivalent of proposed
43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377. See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). The fact that challenges
to ownerships and control links and to the status of violations are made to OSM by applicants or other persons shown
in the AVS under proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(1) and (a)(2), and that OSM's decisions are reviewed under proposed 43 CFR
4.1380&hyph;4.1387, is a function of OSM's maintenance of the data in AVS and its responsibility to keep that data
accurate and up-to-date. But OSM's role in deciding on the accuracy of the data and OHA's role in reviewing those decisions
do not subvert the authority of the state regulatory authority in a primacy state to make decisions on applications
for permits.

NCA/AMC object to OHA's proposed 43 CFR 4.1374(b) and 4.1384(b), which place the ultimate burden of persuasion on
a permittee that seeks review of a notice of proposed suspension or rescission and on an applicant or other persons
that seeks review of an OSM decision on a challenge to an ownership and control link or status of a violation shown in
the AVS. In proposed &sect;&sect;4.1374(a) and 4.1384(a), OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie
case of the validity of the notice or decision. NCA/AMC state that when OSM seeks to overturn a permit as improvidently
issued, it should bear the ultimate burden of proving its case. ``All permits, once issued, should be accorded some
presumption that they were issued in accordance and compliance with applicable law. *&blank;*&blank;* [I]t is the
party seeking to set aside the permitting decision who should bear both the burden of going forward to establish a prima

review of OSM decisions. See 43 CFR 4.1171, 4.1193, 4.1366. OSM's burden of going forward to support a prima facie case
of the validity of its notice or decision means it must present ``sufficient evidence *&blank;*&blank;* to establish
the essential facts *&blank;*&blank;* which evidence will remain sufficient if not contradicted. It is evidence
that will justify but not compel a finding in favor of the one presenting it.''

The NWF comments criticized proposed 43 CFR 4.1371 for its failure to incorporate the rights of citizens to challenge
decisions by OSM regarding improvidently issued permits under 30 CFR 773.20. As explained above, 30 CFR 773.20 provides
that a permit has been improvidently issued if, under the violations review criteria at the time the permit was issued,
the regulatory authority should not have issued the permit. Proposed 43 CFR 4.1371 grants a right of review to a ``permittee
that is served with a notice of suspension under 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) or a notice of proposed suspension and rescission
under 30 CFR 773.21.'' The rights of citizens to appeal similar decisions have been completely overlooked, NWF states.

Similarly, NWF objects to proposed 43 CFR 4.1381, which authorizes ``[a]ny person who receives a written decision
from OSM'' pursuant to proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2) or 773.25(c)(2) to file a request for review of OSM's finding that
such person is in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a violation notice within the scope of 30 CFR 773.5
and 773.15(b). No provision for citizen-initiated appeals of these decisions exists under the proposed rules, NWF
states. ``Decisions by OSM not to act on the information provided by citizens, or decisions to issue permits in the
face of information that indicates an ownership or control link to a violation, should be subject to review by the Office
of Hearings and Appeals,'' NWF comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NWF also criticizes lack of notice to affected citizens. Although proposed 43 CFR 4.1372(b) provides to ``OSM and
all interested parties'' the right to file an answer to a request for review of a decision to suspend or rescind a permit
as improvidently issued and to request an evidentiary hearing even if the person requesting review does not, it is
silent as to how interested parties other than OSM are to know that a request for review has been filed, NWF states. Only
counsel for OSM would be served with a copy of a request for review under 43 CFR 4.1109, NWF observes. Similarly, the
rules proposed in 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 for review of OSM decisions concerning ownership and control links provide
``no notice to citizens who may be substantially and adversely affected by a reversal of a determination of ownership
and control linkage,'' NWF comments. Specific provisions for notice to all affected persons of appeals of both kinds
of OSM decisions should be adopted, NWF urges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OHA agrees that provisions for notice to citizens of appeals of OSM decisions concerning permit suspension and rescission
and concerning ownership and control links and for rights of appeal of such OSM decisions were not included in the proposed
rules. Adding such provisions to the final rules on the basis of NWF's comments, however, without providing an opportunity
for notice and comment, might be regarded as inconsistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act. See

in the future. Meanwhile, no right of appeal by citizens from OSM decisions not to find an ownership or control link
is available under these rules. Citizens may of course avail themselves of existing procedures, e.g., 30 CFR 773.13,
842.11, 842.12, 842.15, and 843.21, and petition for leave to intervene in proceedings under &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377

Changes in the Final Rules From the Proposed Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OHA believes no revisions to proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 and 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 are required in response
to the comments. However, OHA has made the following changes to the proposed rules to improve their clarity and to remove
references to section numbers of the rules proposed by OSM:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 43 CFR 4.1373(a): The phrase ``If a hearing is requested'' has been added at the beginning of the first sentence,
and the remainder of the sentence revised, to account for the possibility that a hearing might not be requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 43 CFR 4.1373(b): ``of the date of the hearing'' has been added at the end of the sentence to make clear that notice
shall be given at least 10 days in advance of the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 43 CFR 4.1375: An alternative deadline is provided for issuance of an initial decision when no hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 43 CFR 4.1380: The language concerning the kind of OSM decisions from which a request for review may be filed has been
revised to replace references to 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b) with a more general description, i.e., decisions on challenges
by an applicant or other person shown in the AVS to an ownership or control link or the status of a violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 43 CFR 4.1381(a): The specific references to proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2) and 773.25(c)(2) and to 30 CFR 773.5 and
773.15(b) have been replaced with language describing the kind of OSM decision from which a request for review may
be filed, i.e., a written decision by OSM, in response to a challenge from an applicant or other person shown in the AVS,
on whether or not the ownership or control link has been shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted and/or whether the
violation covered by the notice remains outstanding, has been corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 43 CFR 4.1383(a): The phrase ``If a hearing is requested'' has been added at the beginning of the first sentence,
and the remainder of the sentence revised, to account for the possibility that a hearing might not be requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 43 CFR 4.1383(b): ``of the date of the hearing'' has been added at the end of the sentence to make clear that notice
shall be given at least 10 days in advance of the hearing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in order to implement the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, OHA has added rules (&sect;&sect;4.1371(c),
4.1381(c)) providing the parties an opportunity to employ alternatives means of dispute resolution, as defined
in 5 U.S.C. 571(3) (1988), before the hearing and appeals procedures set forth in the following rules. Any party could
decline this opportunity, in its discretion, at any time. Because no new obligations are imposed and this voluntary
procedure does not affect substantive rights, its adoption does not require separate notice under the Administrative
Procedure Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule continues in effect without change 24 CFR 81.41 through 81.49, the book entry provisions of the Secretary's
regulations governing the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). This final rule authorizes the issuance
and trading in book-entry form of mortgage-backed and debt securities of Fannie Mae. The Federal Housing Enterprises
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (``the 1992 Act'') provides for a transition period during which all rules
promulgated by the Secretary under the Fannie Mae Charter Act prior to October 28, 1992, are to remain in effect. Under
the 1992 Act, the transition period expires November 28, 1994, which is 18 months following the appointment of the
Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight. Today's action is an emergency regulation to continue
the existing book-entry provisions of the regulations in order to avoid disruption to Fannie Mae's continued authority
for book-entry issuance and trading of Fannie Mae securities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 No new substantive regulations are being adopted through this rulemaking; rather, the Secretary is merely continuing
in effect rules that were not affected by any substantive statutory change under the Federal Housing Enterprises
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (``1992 Act''), enacted as Title XIII of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992; codified generally at 12 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;4641). The
rules continued in effect do not include any changes in the statutory authority of the Secretary made by the 1992 Act.
This rule serves the critical need to ensure continued authority for book-entry trading of the large volume of Fannie
Mae debt and mortgage-backed securities issues. At the same time, the rule does not impose any additional burden on
the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The 1992 Act significantly revised the regulatory requirements and structure for the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae), including its Charter Act (the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, 12
U.S.C. 1716 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Section 1356 of the 1992 Act includes provisions for a transition period during which all rules promulgated by the
Secretary under the Fannie Mae Charter Act prior to October 28, 1992, the date of enactment of the Act, are to remain
in effect. The transition period is to expire 18 months following the appointment of the Director of the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprises Oversight; at such time, both the Secretary's and the Director's rules under the Act were to have
been proposed for public comment and completed in final. The OFHEO Director's appointment was confirmed by the Senate
May 28, 1993; therefore, the 18-month period referenced in Section 1356 expires November 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Secretary will soon propose comprehensive regulations implementing the Secretary's responsibilities under
the 1992 Act, but such regulations will not be effective until after the expiration of the 18-month transition period.
The rules due for automatic expiration on November 28, 1994, include regulations promulgated by the Secretary in
1978 that authorize book-entry procedures for issuance and trading of securities of Fannie Mae (24 CFR 81.41&hyph;81.49).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Today, virtually all of Fannie Mae's debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issuances and trading market depend
on book-entry procedures. As of September 30, 1994, Fannie Mae debt outstanding was $239.3 billion and Fannie Mae
MBS were $523.5 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The 1978 book-entry rules assure the efficient trading of Fannie Mae securities and enhance the secondary mortgage
market. To ensure that Fannie Mae may use book-entry procedures, the Secretary issues this emergency regulation
to continue in effect the 1978 book-entry rules. The Department of the Treasury requires that book-entry regulations
be in force for agencies whose securities are recorded under the book-entry procedures of the Federal Reserve System.
This recodification is required, therefore, to assure continued authority for trading of Fannie Mae securities
in book-entry form after November 28, 1994. Failure to extend these regulations may be disruptive to the financial
markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Prior to the issuance of book-entry regulations, Fannie Mae, investors, brokers, and dealers incurred increased
administrative expenses because of the lack of such authority. Accordingly, the 1978 regulations imposed book-entry
requirements that enhance Fannie Mae's charter purpose of assisting the secondary mortgage market by improving
the distribution of investment capital available for home financing (12 U.S.C. 1716(3)&hyph;(4)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Secretary is empowered to recodify these regulations under section 1321(a) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4541), which
confers on the Secretary general regulatory authority and the authority to ``make such rules and regulations as shall
be necessary and proper'' to ensure that the purposes of the 1992 Act and the Fannie Mae Charter Act are accomplished.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing
Model 747SP series airplanes, that currently requires repetitive inspections for cracks in the web of the wing front
spar over engine numbers 2 and 3, and repair, if necessary. This action would require additional inspections in an
area beyond that specified in the existing AD. This action also would provide for a new, optional terminating modification,
which, if accomplished, would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This proposal is prompted
by a report of cracking in the web in an area outside the inspection zone specified in the existing AD. A crack in the web
that is not detected before it extends outside the chord footprints can allow fuel leakage. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire due to cracking in the web
of the wing front spar.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 6, 1990, the FAA issued AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, amendment 39&hyph;6702
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(55 FR 33279, August 15, 1990), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747SP series airplanes, to require inspections
for cracks in the web of the wing front spar between front spar station (FSS) 636 and FSS 675 over engine numbers 2 and
3, and repair, if necessary. That AD also provides for an optional modification, which, if accomplished, constitutes
terminating action for the required inspections. That action was prompted by a report of a 26-inch crack on the front
spar web. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA received a report of cracking in the web of the wing front spar in an area outside
the inspection zone specified in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18 on a Model 747SP series airplane that had been inspected previously
in accordance with that AD. The report involved a 31-inch fatigue crack between front spar station (FSS) 628 and FSS
659. The crack was initiated by sonic fatigue. In addition, fuel was leaking adjacent to the number 3 engine. The FAA
also received a report of a 24-inch fatigue crack between FSS 646 and FSS 670 on another Model 747SP series airplane.
A crack in the web that is not detected before it extends outside the chord footprints can allow fuel leakage. Fatigue
cracking on the web of the wing front spar, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, can result in fuel leakage
onto an engine and a resultant fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these findings, the FAA has determined that additional actions are necessary on airplanes that were inspected
or modified in accordance with AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18. The FAA finds that an ultrasonic inspection must be performed
in an area that extends beyond that specified in the existing AD. In addition, a high frequency eddy current inspection
of an area of the web one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the lower chord footprints between FSS 628 and FSS
675 must be performed. Additionally, the FAA finds that these inspections must be performed on airplanes on which
the ``terminating modification,'' which was provided in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, was previously installed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994,
which describes procedures for additional inspections of an expanded inspection zone. This revised alert service
bulletin describes the following repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the web between FSS 628 and FSS 675:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Ultrasonic inspections of the web under the upper and lower chord footprints;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. High frequency eddy current inspections of the web in an area one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the
lower chord footprints; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Detailed visual inspections of the forward face of the web of the wing front spar at fastener locations in the web-to-stiffeners
and web-to-rib posts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for accomplishment of an optional terminating modification.
That modification involves removing a section of the web of the wing front spar between FSS 623 and FSS 670 inboard of
the inboard engine, splicing in a new thicker web section, and adding a new stiffener outboard of the web splice. If
this modification is accomplished, the repetitive inspections of the web, as described in the alert service bulletin,
are no longer necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18 to require various repetitive inspections to detect
cracks in the web of the wing front spar in an area beyond that specified in the existing AD, and modification, if cracking
is found. Installation of the modification would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspections.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should note that this NPRM would supersede the existing AD with new, additional inspections and a new terminating
modification. Airplanes on which the previous ``terminating'' modification provided for in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18
had been installed would be required to be inspected in accordance with the new inspections proposed in this notice.
Installation of the new terminating modification, specified in paragraph (e) of this notice, would constitute terminating
action for the requirements of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification program for the engine struts on these
airplanes that will positively address the fatigue cracking condition and other items associated with the engine
struts. Once this modification program is developed and approved, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 35 Model 747SP series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 11 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 22 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections
(between FSS 628 and FSS 675) specified in this AD, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $13,310, or $1,210 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an operator elect to accomplish the terminating modification that would be provided by this AD action, it would
take approximately 644 work hours to accomplish it, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required
parts would be $21,800. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the terminating modification would be $57,220
per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair
Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series airplanes. This proposal would require various modifications
of the passenger doors. This proposal is prompted by reports that some passenger doors froze shut during flight and
could not be opened after landing the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD are intended to prevent the passenger doors from freezing shut, and consequently, prohibiting the passengers
from exiting the airplane in the event of an emergency.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series airplanes. Transport
Canada Aviation advises that some passenger doors froze shut during flight and could not be opened after landing of
the airplane. In some cases, the passenger door outer handle mechanism froze; in others, the latching mechanism seized
as a result of frost in the latch pins of the door. In addition, there have been cases where passenger door pull-out handles
have been found to be damaged as a result of freezing, which can result in failure of the door operating mechanism to
function correctly. Investigation also revealed that the temperature at the passenger and service door area is noticeably
cooler than in other areas of the airplane, due to insufficient insulation of the doors. These conditions, if not corrected,
could result in the inability of passengers to exit the airplane in the event of an emergency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bombardier, Inc., has issued the following service information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;002, Revision `C,' dated December 1, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for applying an anti-ice agent to the operating mechanisms of the passenger
and service doors. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for applying a dry lubrication agent to the
seals of those doors and to the seals of the overwing emergency exits and greasing the passenger door latch pins. Accomplishment
of those actions will decrease the possibility of seizure of the doors and exits as a result of frozen moisture in the
mechanisms and seals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;52&hyph;007, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin
describes procedures for applying grease to the passenger door latch pins and latch pin fittings. Accomplishment
of this service bulletin will decrease the possibility of seizure of the latching mechanisms as a result of frost in
the mechanisms and seals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;008, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for temporarily isolating the pull-out handle from the door latch mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;52&hyph;006, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin
describes procedures for installing sealed insulation packages to the interior of the passenger door/stairway,
service door, and service door surround. Accomplishment of this service bulletin will increase the insulation value
of the passenger and service doors and will reduce heat loss conditions within the passenger and service door areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;009, Revision `B;' dated December 1, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for reaming the passenger door latch pin fittings; installing a grease retainer,
greasing the tube and nipple assembly; and applying grease to the door latch pins and anti-ice compound to the door
outer handle mechanism. Accomplishment of this alert service bulletin will decrease the possibility of seizure
of the latching mechanism as a result of frost in the latch pins of the door.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;021, Revision `A,' dated December 7, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for reworking the passenger door outer handle mechanism, installing a waterproof
boot, and greasing the door. Accomplishment of this alert service bulletin will ensure that the outer handle mechanism
on the passenger door does not freeze during flight of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;11&hyph;007, dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes
procedures for installing new placards on the passenger door structure to advise the crew that when a green witness
mark is visible, the latch pin is in the correct locked position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins and alert service bulletins as mandatory and issued
Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;93&hyph;02R1, dated March 31, 1994, in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available
information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require various modifications of the passenger doors.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletins and service bulletins
described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 17 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
67 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $10,945 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $254,405, or $14,965 per airplane.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Saratoga, Wyoming, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at Shively Field Airport. The
area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth
are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published
subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 16, 1993, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') published a notice of petitions for
exemptive relief submitted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') and the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago
(``CBOT'') and request for comment. The petitions requested exemptions from most of the requirements of the Commodity
Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act'') and Commission regulations for certain exchange-traded futures and option contracts
pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Act, added October 28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period closed December 15, 1993, and the Commission has carefully considered the comments received.
Based upon its review of the comments and its own consideration of the exemption requests, the Commission is proposing
rules which will permit certain contract market transactions (as defined herein) meeting specified criteria to
trade pursuant to exemption from certain requirements under the Act and Commission regulations on a section 4(c)
contract market. The Commission is also seeking comment on whether Part 35 (exemption of swap agreements) should
be amended to include stand-alone prohibitions on fraud and price manipulation.

I. Statutory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act grants the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over ``accounts, agreements (including
any transaction which is of the character of *&blank;*&blank;* an 'option' *&blank;*&blank;*), and transactions
involving contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery traded or executed on a contract market *&blank;*&blank;*
or any other board of trade, exchange, or market *&blank;*&blank;*'' 7 U.S.C. 2. The CEA and Commission regulations
require that transactions in commodity futures contracts and commodity option contracts, with narrowly defined
exceptions, occur on or subject to the rules of contract markets designated by the Commission.

Sections 4(a), 4c(b) and 4c(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(a), 6c(b), and 6c(c). Section 4(a) of the CEA specifically provides,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, that it is unlawful to enter into a commodity futures contract that is not made ``on or subject to the rules of a board
of trade which has been designated by the Commission as a `contract market' for such commodity.'' 7 U.S.C. 6(a). This
prohibition does not apply to futures contracts made on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade, exchange
or market. 7 U.S.C. 6(a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 28, 1992, the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 (``1992 Act'') was signed into law. P.L. No. 102&hyph;546.
This legislation added new subsections (c) and (d) to Section 4 of the Act. New Section 4(c)(1) authorizes the Commission,
by rule, regulation, or order, to exempt any agreement, contract or transaction, or class thereof, from the exchange-trading
requirements of Section 4(a) or any other requirement of the Act other than Section 2(a)(1)(B), 7 U.S.C. 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New Section 4(c)(2) provides that the Commission may not grant an exemption from the exchange-trading requirement
of the Act unless, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the agreement, contract or transaction being exempted will be entered into solely between ``appropriate persons''
as defined in new Section 4(c)(3)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 subject to such limitations as may be deemed appropriate by the Commission, in the public interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In granting such an exemption, the Commission must also determine that the agreement, contract or transaction in
question will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Commission or any contract market to discharge
its regulatory or self-regulatory duties under the Act and that the exemption would be consistent with the public
interest and the purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In vesting the Commission with this new exemptive authority, Congress recognized the need to create legal certainty
for instruments that may contain some features similar to those of regulated exchange-traded products but that are
sufficiently different in their purpose, function or design, or other characteristics such that traditional futures
regulation may be unnecessary.

Specifically, Section 4(c)(1), 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(1), provides: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to promote responsible economic or financial innovation and fair competition, the Commission by rule, regulation,
or order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may (on its own initiative or on application of any person, including
any board of trade designated as a contract market for transactions for future delivery in any commodity under section
5 of this Act) exempt any agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) that is otherwise subject to subsection
(a) (including any person or class of persons offering, entering into, rendering advice or rendering other services
with respect to, the agreement, contract, or transaction), either unconditionally or on stated terms or conditions
or for stated periods and either retroactively or prospectively, or both, from any of the requirements of subsection
(a), or from any other provision of this Act (except section 2(a)(1)(B)), if the Commission determines that the exemption
would be consistent with the public interest.

II. The Petitions for Exemptive Relief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 16, 1993, the Commission published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of petitions for exemption submitted by the CME and CBOT pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c),
and a request for comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In its petition, submitted on April 8, 1993 (and supplemented June 18, 1993), the CME sought an exemption from most
of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations with regard to the purchase and sale of certain contracts denominated
by the CME as Rolling Spot
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 futures and options contracts (``Rolling Spot Contracts''). The CBOT's petition, submitted on June 30, 1993, requested
that the Commission establish a ``professional trading market exemption'' from most of the provisions of the Act
and regulations for trading in any instrument of the CBOT and other boards of trade, including those designated previously
as contract markets by the Commission. Under both petitions, trading in exempted instruments would have been limited
to certain participants, and trades would have been cleared through an exchange clearing system approved by the Commission.

Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c), of the applications submitted by the CME and the CBOT. Specifically, the Commission requested
comment on approximately 100 issues under the following general headings, corresponding to the determinations
that the Commission must make in order to grant an exemption under Section 4(c), 7 U.S.C. 6(c): (1) Whether the exemption
is consistent with the public interest and purposes of the Act; (2) whether the contracts to be exempted will be entered
into solely between ``appropriate persons'' as defined in Section 4(c)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3); and (3) whether
the exemption will have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Commission or any contract market to discharge
its regulatory or self-regulatory duties under the Act.

In addition, on November 23, 1993, the Commission held a roundtable discussion, during which industry experts, including
representatives of end users and dealers in over-the-counter (``OTC'') and exchange-traded derivatives, presented
their views on the exchange petitions. A number of concerns were expressed regarding the way in which the exchanges'
``professional trading market'' would operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were three general sets of commenters: those who expressed unqualified support in favor of the petitions; those
who were generally in favor of the petitions but who thought they should be modified somewhat, either by limiting the
scope of the exemptions and/or by granting the exemptions on a trial basis; and those who were generally against the
petitions. The CME and the CBOT were joined by six other exchanges in expressing their support for the proposals. The
group in favor of the exemptions also included certain futures professionals and academics. The industry's views,
however, were not uniform. Futures trade associations as well as other futures professionals comprised the group
giving their qualified support to the CME and CBOT petitions. Those opposing the petitions largely consisted of regulatory
agencies, both foreign and domestic. In addition, portions of the petitions were criticized by some investment professionals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those supporting the petitions generally believed that the exchanges are operating at a handicap in competing with
the OTC markets because of what they characterized as burdensome, costly, and unnecessary federal regulation. Removing
such regulation would, according to supporters, enhance the competitive posture of the U.S. exchanges in the world
marketplace. Supporters further asserted that professional and institutional traders do not require the same level
of regulatory protection as the small retail speculator. They argued that the Commission should treat transactions
occurring in centralized ``professional trading markets'' the same way that it did swaps, hybrids, and certain energy
transactions, all previously exempted from most or all of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some supporters commented that the exemptions would allow flexible product development, the hallmark of the OTC
market, but in a far more structured regulatory environment. According to these commenters, exchange self-regulation
over derivatives is preferable to no market regulation, the present situation in connection with OTC transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those giving the petitions qualified support generally also endorsed permitting more flexible approaches than
the current designation process as well as enhancing the exchanges' ability to respond to the needs of sophisticated
and institutional market participants and competitive demands of the international marketplace. Nonetheless,
commenters in this category expressed concerns with the petitions, and highlighted the need to ensure the integrity
of both the non-exempt as well as the exempt markets, particularly with regard to financial requirements, customer
funds protections, trade practice rules, market surveillance, exchange governance, and the integrity of the clearing
system. In addition, some of these commenters were not thoroughly convinced that the rules for preventing fraud and
manipulation proposed by the CME and CBOT would be as effective as the current procedures.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The commenters further noted the importance of maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the futures markets.
Some emphasized that public markets like the CME and CBOT imply a comprehensive regulatory environment, including
the imposition of fitness standards for commodity professionals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, two commenters suggested that the CBOT's proposed antifraud rule might exceed the Commission's jurisdictional
scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, some commenters giving the petitions qualified support believed that the absence of defining criteria
for the proposed transactions made their evaluation of the potential consequences of the exchanges' petitions difficult.
Accordingly, commenters in this group generally recommended caution_either by limiting the commodities which
could be traded on a ``professional trading market'' or by granting the exemptions on a trial basis, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters opposing the petitions, in particular other financial regulatory agencies, essentially contended
that the exemption proposals were too broad and lack sufficient justification. Specifically, according to some
commenters, the exchanges failed to make their case that approval of their proposals would be in the public interest.
They further argued that the exchanges have not presented evidence showing that the existing regulatory structure
is so harmful to competition that such broad relief is necessary in order for exchanges to compete effectively. Commenters
against the petitions contended that granting such broad exemptions may have unintended effects on market integrity,
in particular, unexpected consequences for the non-exempt markets and the safety of the clearing system.

Some commenters stated that although the exchanges have indicated that they do not intend to trade identical exempt
and non-exempt contracts, the theoretical possibility of allowing such two-tier trading would raise a number of
concerns, including the drain of liquidity from the non-exempt market and the resulting implications for price discovery,
the potential for manipulation, trading ahead, and other issues relating to the integrity of both the exempt and non-exempt
markets.

Some commenters further noted that Congress warned the Commission to use its new exemptive authority sparingly,
and not as a means of effecting wholesale deregulation of the futures markets. Commenters stated that, contrary to
the exchanges' assertions, there are distinctions between the OTC derivative markets (including the instruments
previously exempted by the Commission) and the contracts traded on the CME, CBOT, and other exchange markets. Whereas
swaps and other OTC derivatives are primarily dispersed, non-fungible, privately-negotiated, principal-to-principal
transactions in which individual credit determinations have been made about disclosed counterparties, exchange-traded
futures contracts are traded among anonymous counterparties and on an agency basis in a public market established
by a third party. Commenters in this category emphasized that an appropriate level of federal regulatory oversight
of exchange markets is necessary to maintain market integrity, and, moreover, that the need for such oversight is
not diminished by the exclusion of certain market participants since exchange regulation is designed to address
the characteristics of that market and many regulatory provisions are designed to protect the market itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, according to some commenters, the ultimate and the appropriate regulatory structure for OTC derivatives
is not settled; rather, Congress and financial regulators are reviewing the need for OTC derivatives regulation.
Some commenters asserted that the entire derivatives market requires more, not less, regulation.

IV. The Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In granting the Commission exemptive authority, Congress cautioned the Commission to use its authority ``sparingly''
and not as a way of prompting a ``wide-scale deregulation of markets falling within the ambit of the Act.''
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In light of this admonition as well as the advice of commenters, in particular that of other financial regulators,
the Commission believes that the scope of the exchanges' petitions, which requested exemptive relief from most of
the provisions of the Act and regulations for all instruments traded by sophisticated participants, is too broad.
Notwithstanding the exchanges' assertions to the contrary, the Commission's previous exemptions for swaps, hybrids,
and certain energy contracts, granted shortly after the Commission was provided with exemptive authority,
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 cannot be equated with the exchanges' requests for exemptive relief. The previous exemptions, which followed extensive
periods of consideration of the issues raised by such instruments,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 arose out of a need specifically recognized by Congress to enhance the legal certainty as to the regulatory status
of those instruments. Each such exemption related to types of transactions that the Commission had previously found
to be beyond the scope of the CEA or unsuitable for regulation thereunder because of the nature of the transaction,
the parties, the applicability of other regulatory regimes or otherwise.

The Commission exempted from most provisions of the Act and regulations the following: (1) hybrid instruments that
are not predominantly composed of a commodity interest (17 CFR Part 34; 58 FR 5580 (Jan. 22, 1993)), (2) swap transactions
meeting certain criteria (17 CFR Part 35; 58 FR 5587 (Jan. 22, 1993)), and (3) certain contracts between commercial
participants for the deferred purchase or sale of energy products (58 FR 21286 (April 20, 1993)).

Each of the Commission's exemptions for swaps, hybrids, and energy products was a culmination of a deliberate and
cautious exercise by the Commission of its regulatory authority that spanned several years. Specifically, the Commission's
consideration of an appropriate regulatory approach for swaps began in December 1987 with the publication of an Advanced
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which addressed a number of types of off-exchange instruments and which solicited
public comments on a wide range of issues. Subsequently, in July 1989, after a second notice-and-comment period,
the Commission issued a policy statement which established a safe harbor for swap agreements meeting certain specified
criteria. This was the foundation upon which the Commission ultimately adopted final rules in January 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's examination of a regulatory approach with regard to hybrid instruments also began with the same
December 1987 Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and request for comments. Based upon the comments received
and its subsequent experience, the Commission in January 1989 proposed rules to exempt certain types of hybrid instruments
meeting specified criteria, and adopted a statutory interpretation which recognized an exclusion from regulation
for other types of hybrids. Following an extensive comment period on its proposed rules, the Commission adopted final
rules in July 1989. These rules and the statutory interpretation, together with the experience gained by the Commission
in administering them, served as the basis for the proposal and ultimate adoption by the Commission in January 1993,
pursuant to its new authority, of rules exempting certain hybrid instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with respect to commercial contracts involving energy products, the Commission received inquiries concerning
the applicability of the Act to transactions of this type following the issuance of the judicial decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
Transnor (Bermuda) Limited v. BP North American Petroleum, et al.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 738 F. Supp. 1472 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). In response, the Commission in September 1990 issued a statutory interpretation
taking the position that commercial transactions of this type which met certain criteria were excluded from regulation
under the Act as ``cash forward'' contracts. Following the enactment of the 1992 Act, the Commission in November 1992
received a petition for exemptive relief concerning similar transactions. In response, the Commission published
a proposed order which would provide exemptive relief to certain persons engaged in contracts involving energy products
that meet certain criteria and, following a public comment period, adopted a final order in this regard in April 1993.

In granting exemptive authority to the Commission under new Section 4(c), the Conferees on the 1992 Act recognized
the need to create legal certainty for a number of existing categories of instruments which traded outside the forum
of a designated contract market. These instruments were noted to contain some features similar to those of regulated
exchange-traded products but are sufficiently different in their purpose, function, design or other characteristics
that, as a matter of policy, traditional futures regulation and the limitation of trading to the floor of an exchange
may be unnecessary to protect the public interest and may create an inappropriate burden on commerce. H.R. Rep. No.
978, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 80 (1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the Commission does not subscribe to the exchanges' apparent view that there are no significant distinctions
between dispersed dealer and central auction markets that would be reflected in assessing the appropriate level
and manner of regulation of transactions undertaken in either forum or that should cause the Commission, in applying
the exemptive criteria of the Act, to treat OTC and central exchange products identically. This is true irrespective
of whether further regulation of the dealer market may be found, as a result of ongoing inquiries, to be desirable.
The federal regulation of futures exchange markets dates from 1922. In 1974, Congress expressly expanded coverage
of the CEA to ``all services, rights and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future
dealt in,'' to assure that the prices generally quoted and disseminated from those contracts could be used as a fair
basis for determining consumer and producer prices.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 To reflect the public interest in the appropriate functioning of price discovery markets and to assure market integrity
and customer protection, a number of regulatory protections are currently required. These requirements reflect
the fact that exchange transactions are conducted between anonymous counterparties and support the financial integrity
of such transactions with marking-to-market, daily or more frequent cash settlement, segregation of customer funds,
capital requirements, margin, recordkeeping and inspection rules, and clearing guarantees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the fact that a centralized market is composed solely of institutional or ``sophisticated'' participants
does not obviate the need to ensure market integrity, price dissemination, and adequate protections against fraud,
manipulation, and other trading abuses by continued Commission regulation and oversight. In this regard, the term
``institutional'' may encompass customers with a wide range of financial experience, acumen and resources. The
Commission believes, moreover, that the Act and Commission regulations serve a vital function, even where such a
market includes only sophisticated participants, in that the regulatory requirements substitute for individualized
credit determinations and permit increased access to the markets by secondary participants and customers. Further,
a premise of the CEA for over 70 years has been that all traders require not only an efficient, but also a fair marketplace
in which to trade, which Congress has previously determined to be best effectuated by a regulatory framework in which
federal regulation is paramount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, notwithstanding the exchanges' arguments to the contrary, since the enactment of the CEA the exchanges
have grown and thrived, not despite, but at least in part, because of the regulatory scheme under which they operate
and the resulting public confidence in the fairness of the markets. The Commission agrees with the commenters who
stated that regulatory safeguards promote public confidence in the integrity of the markets, confidence likely
to be eroded without federal oversight. Accordingly, the Commission is not convinced that a broad exemption of the
kind requested by the exchanges is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission has in the past taken into account in fashioning its regulations, granting exemptions,
and establishing policies, whether the general public is excluded from a market or transaction or is permitted to
participate. The Commission considers the exclusion of non-sophisticated market participants as the single most
important rationale supporting the various forms of relief proposed herein. The proposed relief from certain aspects
of exchange regulation should enhance the exchanges' ability to innovate and their competitive posture. Indeed,
the Commission is cognizant, as the exchanges and other commenters noted, that its exemptive authority is ``intended
to promote responsible economic and financial innovation and fair competition.''

 In issuing its study on U.S. market competitiveness, the Commission stated that it was committed to keeping its regulatory
programs under continuous review to assure that ``consistent with our responsibilities for market integrity and
customer protection, they: (1) keep pace with changes in the marketplace; and (2) do not unnecessarily impede domestic
exchanges from evolving to remain competitive, especially with regard to the cost of compliance relative to non-U.S.
exchanges.''

To that end, the Commission recognizes that some regulatory controls, such as certain procedures for Commission
review and approval of new instruments, could be streamlined in order to facilitate the introduction of products
and the on-exchange offering of more varied contract designs. More flexibility to permit some customizing of exchange-traded
products also may attract certain institutional participants for which the efficiency of exchange markets and other
protections they afford may be preferable to off-exchange transactions where prices are often opaque and credit
risk is a more profound issue. The Commission also believes that exchange transactions traded by professional traders
may not require the full panoply of regulatory requirements. In that regard, the Commission believes that a more flexible
approach to risk disclosure for products offered to sophisticated market participants may be preferable to existing
requirements. In addition, the Commission preliminarily agrees with the commenters who suggested that certain
registration requirements could be streamlined for professional traders licensed with other financial regulators
to facilitate new entrants to the exchange markets by persons currently selling OTC products to sophisticated customers.
Finally, the Commission preliminarily believes that the long-standing traditional requirements of open and competitive
trading could be relaxed for sophisticated, eligible participants in order to facilitate the execution of large
orders, as long as appropriate post-trade transparency, customer, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other market protections from trading abuses are maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, after reviewing the exchanges' petitions and the general comments, the Commission is proposing
to test some ways of giving the exchanges flexibility and greater latitude in order to enhance their ability to devise
innovative responses both to other centralized and to less regulated, non-centralized markets. The Commission
believes that the exemptive relief that it is proposing preserves regulatory safeguards but also acknowledges that
non-centralized markets have a far lower regulatory burden and that several comparable markets of other jurisdictions
provide certain trading mechanism concessions not currently afforded the U.S. futures markets. In that regard,
the Commission proposes a new Part 36, which exempts contracts termed ``section 4(c) contract market transactions''
meeting specified criteria from certain specific requirements and regulations under the Act. There are four main
proposed limitations on the exemption: (1) The duration, (2) the scope, (3) the persons who are eligible to enter into
the transactions, and (4) the transactions which may trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions. The Commission
believes that this proposal strikes the appropriate balance between the need to detect and deter abuses and the need
for an innovative central market tailored to the needs of sophisticated and institutional market participants.
The Commission requests comments concerning the specifics of the proposed criteria for the transactions as well
as the proposed provisions from which the transactions will be exempt.

A. Duration and Scope of Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;36.1(a), the Commission proposes to implement the exemption under a three-year pilot program. The pilot
program is designed to give the exchanges and the Commission a trial period to test the operation of the exemption.
More importantly, it affords the Commission an opportunity to determine the effect of section 4(c) contract market
transactions on the integrity of the marketplace as a whole and whether continued trading under the exemption would
be in the public interest. The trial nature of the program reflects the Commission's belief that the exemption constitutes
a significant departure from the regulatory scheme under which futures and option contracts have been trading for
over 70 years. The Commission believes that the pilot program will enable the Commission to obtain sufficient data
on which to base a permanent program. In this regard, at the conclusion of the pilot program, the Commission intends
to evaluate section 4(c) contract market transactions exempted by this Part in order to determine whether to extend
the exemptive relief granted herein, and whether it would be appropriate to alter the requirements of this Part or
expand the exemptive relief provided to other transactions or markets. The Commission requests comment specifically
addressed to whether a pilot program is feasible and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;36.1(b) sets forth the scope of the exemption. It states that each board of trade on which section 4(c)
contract market transactions are traded is deemed to be a contract market and must comply with all provisions of the
Act and Commission regulations, including the requirement of a clearing facility subject to Commission oversight,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 except for those provisions which are ``specifically inconsistent'' with Part 36. Moreover, new markets that seek
to use this exemption must submit all rules relative to governance, disciplinary proceedings, financial requirements,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et cetera,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under the current provisions of Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12). Therefore, the Commission intends
that section 4(c) contract market transactions trade pursuant to the following provisions: 36.3 (trading rules),
36.4 (listing of transactions), 36.5 (reporting requirements), 36.6 (registration requirements), 36.7 (risk
disclosure), and 36.9 (fraud and manipulation). Except where specifically indicated in Part 36, the provisions
of Part 36 govern in lieu of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations that would otherwise apply to futures
and option transactions. Thus, these provisions of Part 36, explained in detail below, constitute the scope of the
exemption for section 4(c) contract market transactions; all other provisions of the Act and Commission rules, including,
among other things, segregation, net capital, supervision, bankruptcy, exchange emergency actions, availability
of reparations, and private rights of action, would continue to apply. In any submission under proposed Part 36, a
contract market should specify those provisions of the Act and Commission rules which the contract market deems to
be specifically inconsistent with the contract market rules being submitted. The Commission requests comments
concerning the scope of the exemption.

1.41(a)(3), 17 CFR 1.41(a)(3) (1994). The term ``contract market'' includes a clearing organization that clears
trades for the contract market. The Commission does not intend to alter this aspect of the markets it regulates by virtue
of this proposal.

In proposed &sect;36.1(b), the Commission does not intend to limit contract markets in section 4(c) contract market
transactions to current contract markets or exchanges. In order to qualify, such an entity would be treated similarly
to a board of trade seeking an initial designation as a contract market. In addition, under the structure of the Act,
the Commission's regulations, and this exemption, any entity wishing to offer a facility for trading section 4(c)
contract market transactions would be required to become a contract market in these transactions.

B. Appropriate Persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering the persons that may enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions, that is, ``eligible participants,''
the Commission is proposing to use a list of ``appropriate persons'' modeled on the list set forth in Section 4(c)(3)
(A) through (J) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3) (A) through (J), with revisions tailored to this particular market and
reflecting the Commission's experience in applying similar concepts in other exemptions. In this regard, the Commission
is requesting comment whether these proposed requirements should be applied to the Commission's previously-granted
exemptions as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of note is that under proposed &sect;36.1(c)(1), all eligible participants may enter into section 4(c) contract
market transactions for their own accounts; in addition, futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') and floor brokers
may trade section 4(c) contract market transactions on behalf of other eligible participants. In addition, under
proposed &sect;36.1(c)(2)(vii), the Commission is intending to limit eligible employee benefit plans to those
with total assets exceeding $5 million 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``or'' provided in Section 4(c)(3)(G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3)(G)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose investment decisions are made by a bank, trust company, insurance company, investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, or a commodity trading advisor under the CEA. In this regard, the Commission specifically seeks
comment concerning whether there is an asset level for such employee benefit plans which should qualify them as an
eligible participant irrespective of whether their investment decisions are made by a bank, trust company, insurance
company, investment adviser or commodity trading advisor. In addition, in the context of proposed &sect;36.1(c)(2)(viii),
the Commission seeks comment on whether municipalities should be included as ``eligible participants,'' and, if
so, what, if any, limitations would be appropriate in this context. Finally, the Commission is interested in comments
addressing whether the list of appropriate persons as proposed would exclude any individuals, entities, collective
investment vehicles or others who should be considered suitable to engage in section 4(c) contract market transactions,
and in particular whether Part 36 should be conformed to Part 35 in this regard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(c)(3)(K) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3)(K), also authorizes the Commission to determine other persons to
be ``appropriate persons'' for section 4(c) contract market transactions in light of their financial or other qualifications,
or if appropriate regulatory protections are applicable. The Commission is therefore proposing under &sect;36.1(c)(2)(xi)
to permit persons, including natural persons, to enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions provided
their total assets exceed $10 million. The Commission requests comments specifically addressed to whether these
thresholds are appropriate and whether any additional or different financial criteria (such as net worth standards)
should be added to any other category of ``eligible participants'' and, if so, whether part 36 should be conformed
to part 35. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing, in Rule 36.1(c)(2)(x), to include floor brokers and floor traders within the class of
``appropriate persons'' that may participate in section 4(c) contract market transactions. Furthermore, proposed
Rule 36.1(c)(1) would permit floor brokers to enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions on behalf of other
eligible participants. The Commission is not proposing separate financial standards for eligible floor brokers
and floor traders at this time based upon its understanding that each such participant would, by necessity, be a member
in good standing of the section 4(c) contract market whose transactions thereon would be guaranteed by an exchange
clearing member. The Commission seeks comment on whether it should make a requirement of a clearing member guarantee
explicit in the rule and whether it should impose separate financial requirements on floor brokers and floor traders.

C. Transactions Eligible to Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;36.2 establishes the breadth of the exemption, delineating those transactions eligible to trade
as section 4(c) contract market transactions. In that sense, proposed &sect;36.2 modifies the broad definition
of section 4(c) contract market transactions set forth in proposed &sect;36.1(c)(1). Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(1)
provides that except for a major foreign currency, the transaction must be settled either in cash, at a price that meets
the existing Commission requirements for cash-settled contracts set forth in Guideline No. 1, 17 CFR part 5, Appendix

Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(2) states that the transaction must be cleared through a clearing organization subject
to Commission oversight, a provision originally part of the CME and CBOT's petition for exemptive relief. The rules
of clearing organizations subject to Commission oversight as adjuncts to contract markets must be submitted to the
Commission pursuant to section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12).

 Additionally, as the result of section 4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6d(2), such organizations must settle accounts or
positions daily. The rules would require section 4(c) contract market transactions to be separately identified
on the books of the participant in clearing records to facilitate surveillance of these transactions.

Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(3) prohibits section 4(c) contract market transactions on the agricultural commodities
enumerated in section 1a of the Act, except for contracts on a broad-based index thereof. In this regard, the Commission
notes that it did not provide specifically for an exemption from Commission rules concerning speculative position
limits. Under Rule 150.2, 17 CFR 150.2 (1994), the Commission directly administers position limits for futures contracts
on those agricultural commodities. Commission Rule 1.61, 17 CFR 1.61 (1994), requires contract markets to adopt
speculative position limits for futures and option contracts which do not have Commission-set speculative limits.
While in theory Rule 1.61 would apply to section 4(c) contract market transactions, the exemption from that requirement,
1.61(e), 17 CFR 1.61(e) (1994), has been interpreted flexibly to permit the exchanges to substitute for speculative
position limits various position accountability rules for certain futures and option contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the exchanges have already been afforded substantial flexibility in this area. In addition, additional
flexibility in this regard would be afforded by proposed Rule 36.3 which should permit exempt contract markets to
implement trading rules more expeditiously and without formal approval by the Commission. The Commission requests
comment on whether any further relief is appropriate for section 4(c) contract market transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;36.2(a)(4), the Commission is proposing to limit section 4(c) contract market transactions to those transactions
which can ``reasonably be distinguished'' from futures or option contracts designated by the Commission for trading
on a traditional contract market at the time of application to trade a section 4(c) contract market transaction. The
distinguishing factors are described in relation to the contract's hedging function and/or pricing basis. The Commission
will base determinations as to whether section 4(c) contract market transactions are ``reasonably distinguished''
from traditional designated futures and option contracts on the same considerations that it now applies in deciding
whether proposed new futures and options contracts shall be treated as separate designation applications. Proposed
&sect;36.2(a)(4) is intended to address, among other things, the concerns expressed by some commenters regarding
the problems of a two-tier marketplace. Although the CME and CBOT have indicated that they do not intend to trade the
same contract on both a section 4(c) contract market and a traditional contract market, this provision would prevent
a section 4(c) contract market transaction from trading if a traditional contract were already trading on any existing
contract market. A section 4(c) contract market transaction could potentially be submitted for designation for
traditional trading. If so, the full 5a(a)(12) process, including publication for comment, would be followed and
further attention directed to whether delisting as a section 4(c) contract market transaction would be required.
As a consequence, the concern of side-by-side trading of identical contracts subject to different trading regimes
without further review is addressed by this proposal. General disclosure obligations nonetheless would require
purveyors of section 4(c) contract market transactions to clarify that different rules are applicable to those transactions
than for transactions traded pursuant to traditional requirements.

Under proposed &sect;36.2(a)(4), the Commission contemplates that a broad array of contracts would be eligible
for section 4(c) contract market transactions. Thus, the following are examples of potentially permissible section
4(c) contract market transactions in that they are cash-settled and can reasonably be distinguished from currently
designated futures and options contracts: (1) Newly-issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, which are cash-settled
based on either cash transaction prices or firm quotes obtained from electronic information vendors; (2) six-month
London interbank offered rates (LIBOR), which are cash-settled based on a survey of British Bankers Association
rates; and (3) two-year interest rate swaps, which are cash-settled based on a survey of swap dealers to obtain the
rates they are willing to pay or to receive for fixed-rate payments on generic two-year swaps, given a specified notional
amount.

The Commission notes that while these specific, hypothetical contracts can reasonably be distinguished from currently
designated futures and option contracts and therefore permitted to trade under these proposed rules, that may not
necessarily be true at the time a board of trade applies to trade a specific section 4(c) contract market transaction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, proposed &sect;36.2(a)(4) provides for certain specific contracts to be eligible section 4(c) contract
market transactions. First, flexible commodity options, which trade under contract market option rules, but are
not separately designated, may trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions.

Eligible swaps contracts include the contract markets of the CBOT which the Commission designated in cash-settled
three- and five-year interest rate SWAP (IR-SWAP) futures contracts on January 29, 1991. Options based on those futures
contracts were approved by the Commission on February 26, 1991. On September 4, 1992, the Commission approved amendments
submitted by the CBOT to convert the three-year IR-SWAP contracts to 10-year IR-SWAP contracts.

Finally, proposed &sect;36.2(a)(5) provides that any transaction subject to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
2, including stock index futures contracts, is not within the scope of the exemptive rules. Because of special considerations
applicable to such transactions, including the approval procedures of Section 2(a)(1)(B), the Commission believes
that such contracts may not be appropriate for exemption under the proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment on whether the proposed restrictions on section 4(c) contract market transactions
are appropriate.

D. Section 4(c) Contract Market Trading Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 36.3, which permits a board of trade to submit for Commission approval trading procedures for section
4(c) contract market transactions, is intended to facilitate trading in section 4(c) contract market transactions
which do not comply in all respects with certain Commission regulations setting forth trading standards and related
recordkeeping requirements for an open outcry double auction trading environment. In general, Section 36.3 is intended
to permit, subject to certain conditions, section 4(c) contract market transactions to trade pursuant to innovative
trading strategies which may not satisfy existing competitive trading requirements and other trading standards
relative to the exposure of orders and trades. In proposing &sect;36.3 the Commission intends to provide the flexibility
for transactions in a section 4(c) contract market to occur either on the exchange floor, off the floor, or in both locales
subject to immediate post-trade reporting and clearing requirements. The Commission regulations for which exchange
alternatives could be submitted include Regulations 1.35, 1.38(a), 1.39, 155.2, 155.3, and 155.4, 17 CFR 1.35, 1.38(a),
1.39, 155.2, 155.3 and 155.4 (1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Section 36.3 represents a substantial change in the assumptions underlying the method of trading futures
and options contracts. Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6c(a), enumerates certain trading practices which are prohibited,
namely, wash sales, cross trades, accommodation trades, and fictitious sales.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has viewed the ``common denominator'' of the abuses prohibited by Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
6c(a), as the ``use of trading techniques that give the appearance of submitting trades to the open market'' while
in reality ``negating the risk or price competition incident to such a market.''

The Commission has shown some flexibility in the methods it has permitted to implement this competitive execution
requirement. Historically, execution of orders in the futures industry has been conducted by open outcry on the floor
of an exchange. The Commission has indicated, however, that other methods are acceptable under the Act. In this regard,
in 1989, the Commission approved trading on GLOBEX, an electronic computerized trading system for trading futures
and options contracts after regular hours. Under GLOBEX, trading is generally conducted on computer terminals through
a competitive auction process pursuant to an algorithm, under which orders at the best prices would be executed first.
Each terminal provides an equal opportunity for obtaining order execution.

The principal statutory basis for Regulation 1.39 is Section 4b(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b (as amended 1992), which
addresses simultaneous buying and selling orders of different principals. The provision states that such orders
can be executed ``at the market price,'' but requires that the orders be executed ``on the floor of the exchange'' and
``at public outcry across the ring.'' The Commission stated that the legislative history of this provision indicates
that its purpose was to ensure that one order was not disadvantaged to the benefit of the other order or that both orders
were not disadvantaged to the benefit of the broker. According to the Commission, since the statute did not prescribe
the way in which this was to be accomplished, the Commission had the discretion to craft an appropriate method or methods
``to provide for the protection of customers in this area,'' including the discretion to amend Rule 1.39. 56 FR at 12338.

Proposed &sect;36.3 goes beyond LOX in that it not only allows off-floor discussion prior to execution but also allows
execution without exposing the trades to the pit. In proposing a means of permitting these procedures, it is the Commission's
intention to provide a way for exchanges to develop new trading procedures and standards intended to address the needs
of their increasingly institutional market participants. The Commission did not attempt to describe whether there
should be other limits on the procedures as it had no specific proposals to change pending methodologies before it
and wanted to leave the exchanges free to develop designs consistent with the parameters set forth herein.

 This also reflects the Commission's willingness to experiment through a pilot program with rules that relax, for
certain market participants, the traditional Commission requirements for competitive trading. Specifically,
the approach taken affords those participants the opportunity to execute large transactions with greater immediacy
than might be available under existing contract market trading procedures. The Commission preliminarily believes
that by permitting section 4(c) contract market participants to trade in this manner, the futures exchanges' ability
to draw institutional participants to the more transparent exchange (as opposed to OTC) markets will be enhanced.

At the same time, however, the Commission is concerned with maintaining essential market and appropriate customer
protections. Therefore, it is proposing regulatory safeguards with which the exchanges must comply in formulating
any innovative trading procedures. Proposed &sect;36.3(b) lists those requirements which must be satisfied by
a contract market seeking to establish such rules for section 4(c) contract market transactions. In this connection,
the Commission requests comment as to whether additional or different requirements should apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, transactions generally must satisfy Commission recordkeeping and audit trail requirements. Proposed paragraph
(b)(1) of Rule 36.3 requires the contract market to provide for record maintenance and retention consistent with
Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31 (1994). Under proposed &sect;36.3(b)(2), the audit trail for such transactions must
meet the trade register, trade timing, and contract market oversight requirements in Regulations 1.35(e), (g),
and (i), 17 CFR 1.35(e), (g), and (i) (1994), respectively. In addition, the recordkeeping requirements set forth
in Regulation 1.38(b), 17 CFR 1.38(b) (1994), for noncompetitive trades and the audit trail documentation required
under the other provisions of Regulation 1.35, 17 CFR 1.35 (1994), must be satisfied to the extent they are applicable
to the subject trading procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A contract market must demonstrate in a clear and convincing manner that these and any other regulations referenced
in paragraph (b) that it believes are inapplicable to its proposed trading procedures are, in fact, inapplicable.

For example, Regulation 1.35, 17 CFR 1.35 (1994), provides for two orders, an office order (1.35(a&hyph;1)(1)) and
a floor order (1.35(a&hyph;1)(2)(i)). A contract market's proposed procedures may render the requirement for a
floor order inapplicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Commission is proposing to maintain customer protection standards. Commission Regulations 155.2,
155.3, and 155.4, 17 CFR 155.2, 155.3 and 155.4 (1994), set forth customer protection trading standards for floor
brokers, FCMs, and introducing brokers (``IBs'') respectively. Under proposed &sect;36.3(b)(3), the contract
market's proposed procedures must comply with these provisions to the extent they are applicable.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, Regulation 155.2, 17 CFR 155.2 (1994), sets forth standards for floor brokers. If, however, under proposed
section 4(c) contract market trading rules, a function analogous to that of a floor broker does not exist, that rule
would not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, the transactions must be transparent. The Commission is proposing in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of Rule
36.3 certain requirements for the reporting and identifying of section 4(c) market transactions after they are executed.
Specifically, in addition to the trade recordation requirements listed above, the transactions are to be reported
immediately to the floor of the exchange and are to be disseminated immediately on the relevant market floor, trading
screen, and/or vendor services through the exchange's market quotation system. Records must be maintained of the
time of execution to this end.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The information to be so reported must include, at a minimum, price, quantity, and contract. To the extent that a proposal
for section 4(c) contract market transactions might provide for trading when the exchange floor is closed, the Commission
would still require the immediate report and dissemination of that transaction information. Brokers engaging in
such transactions will need to have supervisory procedures in place reasonably designed to achieve such post-trade
transparency. The Commission believes that these proposed requirements to report and specifically identify section
4(c) contract market transactions will provide the public with notice of the way in which the prices in this market
have been reached. As such, persons relying on these prices for price basing purposes will have the opportunity to
take that information into account. The Commission requests comment on these requirements.

records.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, the Commission is proposing requirements intended to ensure the financial integrity of the transactions.
Proposed paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 36.3 requires section 4(c) contract market trading rules to provide that section
4(c) contract market transactions be reported to clearing and be cleared by the contract market on the same schedule
as required for trades subject to Regulations 1.38 and 1.39. Should there be no such schedule, then the report to clearing
must be immediate. The Commission requests comment as to whether clearing procedures should be further articulated
in that case. In this connection, the Commission notes that the clearing arrangements would be subject to Commission
oversight and that proposed clearing rules would require prior Commission review under Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12), and Regulation 1.41, 17 CFR 1.41 (1994). The section 4(c) contract market clearing organization
would have an affirmative duty under the Act and Commission regulations to enforce its rules, and would be subject
to recordkeeping, document retention, and other applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to NYSE market surveillance staff, block trades are not separately identified as such on the exchange's
audit trail/time and sales register. However, NYSE would be able to ascertain whether a trade is a block trade by contacting
the transacting members, each of whom must keep a record reflecting which of its trades are blocks. Interestingly,
while not separately identifying block trades in its audit trail, NYSE and its vendors do have a separate ``block trade''
ticker which runs throughout the day reflecting size and price of block trades alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment on whether to require the dissemination of separate pricing information for block
trades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed paragraph (c), any submission made hereunder for proposed section 4(c) contract market transactions
must describe fully the contract market procedures and systems that will assure compliance with Sections 4b and 4c(a)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6c(a), with respect to prohibitions on abuse of customer orders, including frontrunning
of such orders, misuse of information, and wash sales and fictitious trades. This provision reflects, among other
things, the Commission's continuing concern that customer orders receive appropriate priority and that trading
between markets or locations does not cause distortions in prices or provide advantages to one class or user of the
markets over others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this connection, proposed paragraph (g) of Rule 36.3 states that trades entered into in compliance with section
4(c) contract market trading rules shall not be in violation of Sections 4b(a)(iv), 4b(b) or 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
6b(D), 6b or 6c(a), ``based solely on having been executed noncompetitively.'' Failure to comply explicitly with
such contract market rules will render the conduct involved subject to Commission action under Sections 4b and 4c(a)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6c(a), and Regulations 1.38 and 1.39, 17 CFR 1.38 and 1.39 (1994), in addition to any other
applicable provisions of the Act and Regulations.

the Commission to review and approve the applicant's core rules regarding, among other things, clearing, governance,

Section 2(a)(8)(B)(ii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4a(g), allows forty-five days for the Department of the Treasury and the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to comment on any application by a board of trade for designation as
a contract market involving transactions for the future delivery of any security issued or guaranteed by the United
States or any agency thereof. In light of the ten-day time frame for new filings and amendments, the Commission intends
to waive Section 2(a)(8)(B)(ii) for section 4(c) contract market transactions. The Commission requests comment
on waiving this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This limited, ten-day advance notice period for new filings and for amendments to existing terms and conditions is
designed to remove potential impediments to the development of new products which are eligible for the proposed section
4(c) contract market transactions. The Commission believes that a streamlined approach will not only give the exchanges
flexibility but also will permit them to launch new products rapidly to meet the competitive demands of the marketplace
and to take advantage of opportunities in a fast-changing market. This procedure is limited to certain cash-settled
contracts in order to avoid issues related to delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed ten-day notification requirement for section 4(c) contract market transactions does not
contemplate the same level of prior Commission review and approval of terms and conditions as is required by Commission
Rule 1.41(b), 17 CFR 1.41(b) (1994), for contracts traded on traditional contract markets, the Commission has continuing
authority to ensure that section 4(c) contract market transactions remain consistent with the public interest and
the purposes of the Act. In this regard, proposed &sect;36.8 provides that the Commission can suspend or revoke an
exemption if it fails to meet these requirements.

The Commission is proposing that contract markets, FCMs, and large traders who conduct section 4(c) contract market
transactions comply with certain reporting requirements similar to those currently in effect for persons trading
in non-exempt commodity futures and/or options. These requirements are being proposed in lieu of the requirements

1. Reporting Requirements for Contract Markets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing in &sect;&sect;36.5 (c)(1) and (e) that contract markets operating pursuant to this
section provide information daily to the Commission and to the public concerning total open interest, transactions,
and prices for each commodity or type of contract similar to that required under Rule 16.01 for non-exempt futures
and options. This information is intended to give the Commission an overview of the size and development of these markets
and provide potential participants with important information concerning the depth and breadth of the markets as
well as the opportunity to compare transaction prices against other markets trading the same commodity. In addition,
in &sect;36.5(c)(2), the Commission is proposing that contract markets provide open interest and transaction information
for each clearing member similar to that required under Rule 16.00, 17 CFR 16.00 (1994). This information is necessary
for market surveillance, providing needed input into the Commission's financial monitoring system for clearing
member FCMs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Last, in &sect;36.5(c)(3), the Commission is proposing that contract markets supply information concerning large
traders conducting section 4(c) contract market transactions, but only on call by the Commission. In order to ensure
that the financial integrity protections currently provided by using such reports are maintained, the Commission
anticipates that contract markets trading section 4(c) contract market transactions will by rule require members
to file daily reports concerning accounts carried by large traders similar to the information now provided by FCMs,
clearing members, and foreign brokers under Rules 16.02, 17.00, and 17.02, 17 CFR 16.02, 17.00, and 17.02 (1994),
for large traders in non-exempt futures and options. The Commission will rely on contract markets to define, subject
to Commission approval, position levels at which a trader is considered large. Under this proposal, the Commission
would monitor the development of the markets to determine if and when it would require that the contract markets submit
large trader reports. If these exempt contract markets develop rapidly, the Commission may require large trader
reports on a daily basis to augment the information it currently receives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing that all information, with the exception of account identification forms, be provided
in machine-readable form using a format and coding structure approved in writing by the Commission or its designee.
Contract markets currently provide option and futures data pursuant to similar requirements.

2. Reporting Requirements for FCMs, Introducing Brokers and Traders
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to incorporate into &sect;36.5 the provisions of Commission Rules 15.05 and Part 21,
17 CFR 15.05 and Part 21 (1994). Section 15.05 states that any FCM who makes or causes to be made any futures or option
contract for the account of any foreign broker or foreign trader, and any IB who introduces such an account to an FCM
is deemed to be the agent of the foreign broker or the foreign trader for purposes of accepting delivery and service
of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker or the foreign trader with respect
to any futures or option contracts maintained in such accounts carried by the FCM.

17 CFR 21.02 and 21.02a (1994)) or, in the case of special market situations (&sect;21.03, 17 CFR 21.03 (1994)), when
information is needed about all, rather than only reportable, traders in a market. The Commission believes that it
is important to retain this authority with respect to participants operating under Part 36 so that the Commission
can make informed decisions and take appropriate action as special situations warrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also proposing that eligible participants in section 4(c) contract market transactions be subject
to requirements similar to those contained in &sect;&sect;18.00, 18.04, and 18.05, 17 CFR 18.00, 18.04, and 18.05
(1994), for large futures and options traders trading in the non-exempt market. The requirements proposed in &sect;36.5(f)
paragraphs (2) (i) and (ii) would require large traders to file, on call by the Commission, information concerning
their positions and transactions in the subject market as well as identifying and other information contained on
CFTC Form 40. Proposed &sect;36.5(f)(1) would require large traders to maintain books and records concerning section
4(c) contract market transactions and commercial activities that the trader hedges in the commodity underlying
such transactions. Reports concerning these transactions and activities would have to be furnished on request to
the Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice.

G. Special Temporary License, Registration or Principal Listing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is also proposing, in &sect;36.6, to allow special procedures that would be available to a person associated
with an FCM or IB who limits his or her activities to certain specified instruments. If this rule were to be adopted,
the Commission would expect to set forth in an Appendix A to Part 36 those instruments to which the special registration
procedures would apply. An instrument would be included in such an Appendix A only upon petition by a contract market
demonstrating that it is not contrary to the purpose of the Act and the registration rules promulgated thereunder
or to the public interest to permit special temporary license, registration or principal listing procedures for
persons licensed with another federal financial regulatory authority and involved only with that instrument. Although
to obtain a temporary license, such persons would have to certify that they are not subject to statutory disqualification
under Section 8a(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a(2), the National Futures Association (``NFA'') could, for example, waive
the fingerprint requirement. Further, the Commission notes that although proficiency testing requirements are
governed by NFA Rules 401 and 402 and interpretive notices related thereto, such a contract market petition could
also address whether alternative proficiency testing requirements would be appropriate. Registration, of course,
could continue to be denied under Sections 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a(3) or 12a(4). If the Commission were
to approve the contract market petition, NFA could then adopt and submit for Commission approval special registration
procedures to govern those persons involved only with the particular instrument that is the subject of the petition.
The Commission, nonetheless, wishes to make clear that a contract market seeking special registration procedures
with respect to persons limiting their activities to a particular new instrument may consult with NFA and develop
such procedures to be submitted in conjunction with the contract market application for simultaneous consideration
by the Commission. Such NFA rules could vary depending upon the instrument involved and would be considered by the
Commission on a case-by-case basis. The Commission would expect to include in Appendix A to Part 36 those instruments
covered by the pending petitions of the CBOT and the CME to which Part 36 applies. This authority would be comparable
to that already established under Part 3 of the Commission's regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

in particular their practicability.

H. Risk Disclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing, in &sect;36.7, to permit accounts to be opened for section 4(c) contract market transactions
without furnishing an eligible participant with the basic risk disclosure statements applicable generally to non-exempt
futures and option contracts under Commission Rules 1.55, 1.65, 33.7, and 190.10, 17 CFR 1.55, 1.65, 33.7, and 190.10
(1994), or the Commission's newly-adopted generic risk disclosure statement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
46
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These basic risk disclosure statements are intended to provide a brief description of some of the risks attendant
to futures and options trading and are designed to be understood by all customers. Since section 4(c) contract market
transactions would be entered into only by sophisticated or high net worth persons or those engaged in the futures
industry, and since the products themselves may be different from traditional futures and option contracts, the
Commission believes that it may be appropriate to substitute for standard disclosure statements such disclosure
as may be appropriate to the customer's expertise and financial capacity, tailored to the particular product. Therefore,
in lieu of requiring a specific statement or format, the proviso to proposed &sect;36.7(a) would require an FCM or,
in the case of an introduced account, an IB, to furnish an eligible participant with disclosure appropriate to the
particular instrument and the eligible participant prior to the eligible participant's entry into the first section
4(c) contract market transaction involving a particular instrument.

59 FR 34376 (July 5, 1994). This statement currently can be used in the U.S., in the United Kingdom, in Ireland and in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, the Commission notes that Rule 1.55(f), 17 CFR 1.55(f) (1994), currently states that furnishing the
required disclosure statement under that rule does not relieve an FCM or IB from any other disclosure obligation it
may have under applicable law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission further notes that exchanges with non-traditional trading systems have required, on their own initiative,
special risk disclosures applicable to such systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
48
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission further notes that in order to qualify for the exemption of swap agreements under Part 35 of its rules,
an agreement must be entered into by an eligible swap participant, the definition of which is closely followed by proposed
Rule 36.1(c)(2), and there are no specific disclosure requirements under Part 35 of the Commission's rules, 17 CFR
Part 35 (1994).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
49
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission therefore preliminarily believes that it is striking the appropriate balance in proposed Rule 36.7
with respect to disclosure in light of the eligible participants and products involved. The Commission requests
comment concerning the risk disclosure requirements for section 4(c) contract market transactions.

The Commission notes that proposed &sect;36.7(b), which provides that ``[t]his section does not relieve a futures
commission merchant or introducing broker from any other disclosure obligations it may have under applicable law,''
is included as a reminder that Section 4b of the Act requires all material information to be disclosed. The fact that
other proposed sections of Part 36 do not have a similar ``catch-all'' provision should not be interpreted to mean
that the Act or Commission regulations do not apply to those sections.

Proposed &sect;36.8 mirrors the requirements for exemptive relief under Section 4(c) of the Act, namely that any

&sect;36.8 provides that, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the exemption may be suspended or revoked.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

, those provisions of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 9, 15, 13b and 13(a), that prohibit price manipulation,
and Commission Rules 33.9 and 33.10, 17 CFR 33.9 and 33.10 (1994), which prohibit fraudulent conduct and price manipulation
in connection with commodity option transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition for exemption, the CBOT included a rule specifically prohibiting fraud and manipulation relating
to professional market transactions. The CBOT petition explains:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Fraud and manipulation are the core proscriptions of the Commodity Exchange Act*&blank;*&blank;*. Rather than
engage in a hyper-technical legal effort to mesh certain exempt transactions with the requirements of the CEA's existing
fraud and manipulation provisions, the proposal contains a special antifraud and antimanipulation provision.
That approach will make certain that any party committing fraud or engaging in manipulative practices in connection
with an otherwise exempt transaction *&blank;*&blank;* would not be able to wriggle out of liability under the CEA
under some legal technicality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 43414, 43433 (August 16, 1993). The CME did not suggest the adoption of a specific fraud and manipulation rule;
nonetheless, it did not request an exemption from the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the Act and Commission
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its consideration of the petitions and the comments received thereon, the Commission is also considering whether
to adopt specific stand-alone rules prohibiting fraud and manipulation to supplement proposed &sect;36.9. In this
regard and as noted above, the exemption being proposed would relieve the exchanges and their members from some provisions
of the Act and regulations that are intended to provide prophylactic protection for customers. In the absence of these
protections, it may be appropriate to apply broader antifraud and antimanipulation prohibitions to effectively
control certain abusive conduct, such as trading ahead of customer orders in any form and failure to disclose material
information. As a result, the Commission is proposing, in &sect;36.9(a), a free-standing antifraud rule for section
4(c) contract market transactions modeled after Commission Rule 33.10, 17 CFR 33.10 (1994). The Commission specifically
requests comments concerning whether it should adopt such a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also requesting comment concerning whether those provisions of the Act and rules thereunder reserved
in the manipulation provision, &sect;36.9(b), are adequate in this regard or whether the Commission should also
adopt an additional free-standing antimanipulation rule. Should commenters believe that a free-standing antimanipulation
rule is warranted, comment is requested concerning whether a rule prohibiting manipulation or attempted manipulation
of the price of any section 4(c) contract market transaction or of any commodity in interstate commerce or any contract
of sale of a commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market, would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a related matter, the Commission is also seeking comment on whether Part 35 of its rules, 17 CFR Part 35 (1994), which
provides an exemption for certain swap transactions, should be amended to include specific stand-alone prohibitions
of fraud and price manipulation like those discussed above.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 While Section 4b of the Act has provided an adequate tool to address fraud in traditional futures contract trading,
and Section 4o (which is also reserved in Part 35) addresses the giving of advice, questions have been raised about
the efficacy of these provisions as applied to certain of the transactions included in the ambit of Part 35. An amendment
to Part 35 in this regard would eliminate any such questions and could also provide desirable consistency in the legal
standards applicable to both section 4(c) contract market transactions and exempt swap transactions. Comment is
requested concerning the type of antifraud and antimanipulation rules that the Commission should adopt if it determines
to do so.

The Commission believes that to the extent that firms defined as small businesses under section 3 of the Small Business
Act could offer or be offered section 4(c) contract market transactions, the proposed rules would not add any legal,
accounting, consulting or expert costs. No one is required to trade section 4(c) contract market transactions. The
proposed rules would merely provide exemptive relief for those trading such transactions. The determination of
whether a section 4(c) contract market transaction would qualify for the proposed exemption requires minimal analysis
of data that will be readily accessible to the offeror. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, certifies pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
that the proposed rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Nonetheless,
the Commission invites comment from any firm which believes that these proposed rules would have a significant economic
impact on its operations.

, the EPA is announcing a 3-month stay and reconsideration of certain portions of the ``National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject
to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks'' (collectively known as the ``hazardous organic NESHAP'' or the
``HON''). The EPA is issuing the stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7606(d)(7)(B), which
provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is a proposal to extend the compliance date for certain compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers to allow the time necessary for installation of controls. Changes are also being proposed to the applicability
of control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. This action also proposes a temporary extension
of the applicable compliance dates beyond the 3 months of the stay, but only as necessary to complete reconsideration
(including appropriate regulatory action) of the rule in question.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the EPA promulgated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (``NESHAP'') for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing
industry (SOCMI), and for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks portion of the rule. These regulations
were promulgated as subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly referred to as the hazardous organic NESHAP,
or the HON. The final rule required existing sources to comply with subpart H beginning October 24, 1994 for some groups
of SOCMI processes and for processes subject to subpart I. These compliance dates were the same as the proposed compliance
dates and were consistent with the agreement on the negotiated rule for equipment leaks. The final rule required existing
sources to comply with subpart G no later than April 22, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments on the proposed rule included a substantial number of requests for a compliance schedule for subpart
H similar to the 3-year schedule provided under subpart G. Several commenters argued that the 6-to-18-month compliance
period in proposed subpart H did not take into consideration the implementation problems that could arise during
installation of required equipment. A few commenters thought that proposed subpart H did not permit applications
for compliance extensions. The EPA did not revise the compliance schedule as requested because the commenters did
not provide any information that would justify establishing a source-category-wide compliance schedule similar
to that provided in subpart G. Due to the lack of detailed information on equipment changes and installation schedules,
the EPA thought that case-by-case compliance extensions would be sufficient to address any implementation problems
that might arise. In issuing the final rule, the EPA added a provision, &sect;63.182(a)(6), to clarify that individual
extensions of compliance may be requested for installation of equipment required by subpart H.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second major area of public comment concerned the proposed definition of product accumulator vessel and its overlap
with the definitions for process vents and storage vessels. Major concerns expressed included: (1) The proposed
definition did not distinguish between product accumulator vessels and process vents, storage vessels or other
in-process vessels; (2) multiple standards (process vents under subpart G and equipment leaks under subpart H) would
apply to the same vent; and (3) product accumulator vessels, which are point sources, would be regulated under provisions
that were intended for fugitive emissions (i.e., equipment leaks). These commenters suggested eliminating the
inconsistencies by: (1) Deleting the subpart H requirements for product accumulator vessels and regulating them
as process vents or storage vessels under subpart G; or (2) allowing sources to select whether to comply with the requirements
of subpart G or subpart H. Several commenters representing the non-SOCMI processes subject to subpart H also suggested
deleting requirements for product accumulator vessels for those processes from subpart H. A few of these commenters
thought that the EPA had added these provisions to the negotiated rule after the conclusion of the negotiations. The
commenters preferred regulating such vessels under future MACT standards for the appropriate source category.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the April 22, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 19440), the EPA concluded that, of the equipment included in the definition of ``product accumulator vessels,''
only surge control vessels and bottoms receivers were outside the scope of process vents, storage vessels, and wastewater.
Therefore, the term ``product accumulator vessel'' was removed from subpart H, and replaced with ``surge control
vessels and bottoms receivers.'' This change was intended to clarify the applicability of the rules and was not a change
in the substance or effect of the negotiated rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the final rule was issued, it has become apparent that compliance with the provisions of &sect;63.164 and &sect;63.170
involves more equipment modifications and changes than originally believed. Additionally, the EPA has determined
that an administrative process needs to be added to subparts F and I to establish these case-by-case compliance extensions.
A petition for reconsideration has been submitted to the EPA requesting reconsideration of the compliance dates
for compressors, &sect;63.164, and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, &sect;63.170.

II. Summary of and Rationale for Proposed Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposal is to revise the compliance dates for compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers to provide sufficient time to make the equipment changes necessary for compliance with the provisions
of &sect;63.164 and &sect;63.170. It is proposed to add new paragraphs &sect;63.100 (k)(4) through (k)(7) and &sect;63.103(g)
to subpart F to revise the compliance dates for existing sources and to document the use of the compliance extensions.
Similar changes are also being proposed for subpart I, as new paragraphs &sect;63.190 (e)(3) through (e)(5). This
action also proposes a revised &sect;63.170 to address issues that have arisen over technical feasibility of these
control provisions and confusion over the distinction between surge control vessels, on the one hand, and process
vents or storage vessels, on the other hand. This action also proposes to add paragraph (k)(8) to &sect;63.100 and
paragraph (h) to &sect;63.103 providing a compliance extension for processes that plan to eliminate the use of or
production of HAP.

1. Compliance Schedule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance with the provisions of &sect;63.170 requires that the surge control vessel or bottoms receiver be routed
to the process or to a control device. Since the rule was issued, the EPA has received numerous inquiries regarding
the feasibility of complying in the specified compliance period given the nature of the process changes required
for either of the compliance options. Based on this information and review of the rulemaking record, the EPA has concluded
that the nature of the equipment changes required is similar to the changes required for compliance with the provisions
for process vents, storage vessels, etc. subject to subpart G. The scope of the equipment changes is, thus, more complex
than was originally envisioned when the 6-month compliance date was selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new information that the EPA has received demonstrates that at many facilities major equipment modifications
or replacements are necessary in order to comply with the standard. The process changes involved include rerouting
of a vent stream to a control device or to the process; replacement of a surge control vessel operated at atmospheric
pressure with another that can be operated at a pressure greater than atmospheric; replacement, removal or addition
of other equipment; and process redesign. Such process changes take more than a few months to effect, especially considering
planning, approval of permits, and in some cases approval by the Food and Drug Administration or other government
entities. All these changes require the same degree of engineering design and evaluation that the controls required
for process vents and storage vessels require. Furthermore, from the range of situations reported, it appears that
the need for additional time to implement the required equipment changes is not limited to specific processes or kinds
of equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of new information received since publication of the final rule, the EPA has concluded that the compliance
date for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers should be the same as that for process vents and other equipment
subject to subpart G, i.e., April 22, 1997. Due to the widespread need for the additional time to design, purchase,
install, and permit new equipment, the EPA proposes to revise the compliance date to April 22, 1997 for all sources
subject to the provisions of &sect;63.170. This proposed language is presented in &sect;63.100(k)(7) of subpart
F and &sect;63.190(e)(6) of subpart I.

In addition to the concern with the achievability of the compliance dates, the EPA has received numerous inquiries
regarding the definition of surge control vessels and the distinction between surge control vessels (and bottoms
receivers) and storage vessels. The EPA has concluded from these discussions that this confusion is partially attributable
to the fact that the present definition for surge control vessel is too broad and implies that any vessel that is not
a storage vessel, e.g., knockout pot, is a surge control vessel. A revised definition for ``surge control vessel''
is being proposed to clarify that the term is limited to vessels that are within the process unit to provide in-process
storage, mixing or management of flow rates or volumes to assist in production of a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even with this revised definition, the EPA recognizes that considerable overlap will remain between vessels used
for storage of materials, storage vessels, and equipment that meets the definition of surge control vessels or bottoms
receivers. This is expected because the equipment is frequently indistinguishable in terms of structure, size,
materials of construction, and materials stored. In many cases, these items of equipment may be distinguished only
after reviewing process diagrams to determine whether the chemicals in the vessel will undergo further processing
steps at the chemical manufacturing process unit. The EPA is aware that in some cases surge control vessels and other
unit operations have been regulated as storage vessels although the function of the particular vessels was not for
storage of feed materials or product. This classification probably occurred because the equipment is physically
indistinguishable from other containers used for storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To minimize the confusion over appropriate categorization of equipment, the EPA believes it would be most appropriate
to apply the same control criteria to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers that are applied to storage vessels
in subpart G. This approach should provide a workable solution to the problem by eliminating the remaining differences
between the two categories of equipment and should avoid creating unforeseen problems. An additional consideration
in this decision was that this approach would involve only minimal changes to the present text of the rule. Given the
length and complexity of the HON as a whole, the EPA thinks such a change would be understood more readily and with fewer
implementation delays. If surge control vessels and bottoms receivers were addressed in subpart G, substantial
redrafting would be required throughout subpart G. Therefore, the EPA considered this alternative to have a greater
potential for creating more issues and confusion than if the problem were addressed in subpart H. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the storage vessel control criteria is also considered appropriate for the following reasons. First, it
would take considerable time, perhaps as much as 1 to 2 years, to gather the necessary information and establish separate
control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. Second, information presently available
to the EPA indicates that surge control vessels and bottoms receivers have been regulated as storage vessels in a number
of cases. Third, the range of physical characteristics and operating conditions of surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers appears to substantially overlap that of storage vessels. Although the EPA does not have quantitative
data on the characteristics and controls of surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, EPA considers the storage
vessel information to provide the best available data on the characteristics of surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers. Therefore, the EPA believes the MACT floor analysis and selection of the standard analysis for storage
vessels are adequate for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers.

B. Compressors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of &sect;63.164 require the use of mechanical seals equipped with a barrier-seal system and controlled
degassing of the barrier fluid or enclosure of the compressor seal area and venting of emissions through a closed-vent
system to a control device. The standard also allows designation of a compressor as being subject to a 500 ppm performance
standard. These provisions are consistent with the provisions in existing equipment leak standards in 40 CFR parts
60 and 61. Because no public comments were received that identified categories of compressors or types of changes
that justified compliance times longer than the 6 to 18 months provided in the proposed rule, the EPA concluded that
case-by-case extensions would be sufficient to address any implementation problems that might arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the final rule was issued, the EPA has received new information that indicates it is infeasible for some sources
subject to the October 24, 1994 compliance date to comply with the compressor provisions in the allotted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6-month compliance period. In the development of the equipment leak rule, the EPA treated control of compressors
as requiring similar lead times and control measures as those required for control of pumps. It has since been determined
that significant differences exist in the time required to make the necessary equipment changes for compressors.
In particular for some compressors, compliance with the provisions of &sect;63.164 requires replacement of an existing
mechanical seal system or identification of an alternative barrier fluid system. Because compressors are individually
designed for each process and for the expected range of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, chemicals
in the process, etc.), selection of replacement seal or barrier fluid systems requires case-by-case engineering
evaluation and equipment specification. Replacement of a seal system or barrier fluid system for a compressor could
involve significant capital outlay and always requires careful planning and evaluation to ensure continued proper
operation of the compressor. For projects of this nature, the time required to conduct and complete such an assessment,
write equipment specifications, bid and purchase the equipment is roughly 1 year. Actual installation of the replacement
seal or barrier fluid system reportedly can be completed within 1 week. Thus, the EPA believes that 1 year is the minimum
feasible period for installation of required equipment. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to revise the compliance
date for compressors at process units subject to the October 24, 1994 and January 23, 1995 compliance dates to April
24, 1995. The proposed language is presented in new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(4) in subpart F and &sect;63.190(e)(3)
in subpart I.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has also determined that provisions need to be added to subparts F and I to provide a mechanism for owners or operators
to request case-by-case compliance extensions for delays due to unavailability of parts. Since replacement seal
systems and barrier fluid systems are designed for the compressor and the unit, it is possible that the vendor company
may not be able to provide the replacement system on schedule and there would be no other vendor who could quickly provide
the parts. When the EPA established the compliance date for the compressor provisions, the possible need for such
a compliance extension was not recognized. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to allow application for a compliance
extension in cases where replacement of the seal system or barrier fluid system is required and additional time is
necessary due to unavailability of parts. The proposed language is presented in new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(5)
to subpart F and paragraph &sect;63.190(e)(4) to subpart I. The EPA expects that this compliance extension provision
will be used only in those rare cases where, despite proper planning and scheduling by the owner or operator, the replacement
seal or barrier fluid system is not available on time. The EPA expects that with the proposed revisions to the compliance
date the vast majority of compressors will not need compliance extensions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reevaluating the compliance period provided in the rule for compressors, the EPA also reconsidered whether it
was appropriate to allow compliance extensions in cases where a process unit shutdown is necessary to permit installation
of the replacement seal system or barrier fluid system. Typically, in a shutdown of a process unit with a compressor,
the entire system is depressurized and the equipment is cleared of process fluids. Even with good air pollution control
practices, such a process unit shutdown could involve substantially more emissions than if the compressor were allowed
to operate with seals that do not meet the technical specifications of the standard. Whether delaying installation
of replacement seals or barrier fluid systems is environmentally beneficial depends on the particular circumstances
of each case as well as the length of the delay. Therefore, after evaluating the tradeoffs, the EPA concluded that compliance
extensions until the next scheduled process unit shutdown should be allowed in certain circumstances. The EPA also
judged that, based on estimates of the expected tradeoffs in emissions reduction, all compressors should be in compliance
with the requirements of &sect;63.164 no later than April 22, 1996. These proposed changes to the compliance dates
are presented in paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(5) of subpart F and &sect;63.190(e)(5). The EPA wants to emphasize that
these proposed compliance extensions would be available only in cases where a process unit shutdown is necessary
to allow installation of a new seal system or a new barrier fluid system or requires changes to the existing barrier
fluid system.

The EPA is proposing to allow compliance extensions for processes that plan to eliminate the use or production of HAP
from their process. Subpart I presently provides, in &sect;63.190(e), additional time for such process changes.
The proposed new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(8) would be added to subpart F to address an oversight in the drafting
of the final rule.

, the EPA is announcing, pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), reconsideration of the equipment leak provisions
of the HON dealing with compressors and with surge control vessels and bottoms receivers (40 CFR 63.164, 63.170).
In that action the EPA is also announcing a 3-month partial stay of those provisions during the reconsideration. However,
the EPA may not be able to complete reconsideration of, and any appropriate curative regulatory action to, the rule
within the 3-month period expressly provided by Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). If the EPA does not complete the
reconsideration and rulemaking in this timeframe, then it will be necessary to temporarily extend the applicable
compliance dates until the EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. By this action the EPA proposes,
pursuant to section 301(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), a temporary extension of the compliance
dates beyond the 3 months provided for Group I sources that had been required to comply with subpart H by October 24,
1994, and for sources required to comply as of January 23, 1995 or later, only as necessary to complete reconsideration
and revision of the rule in question. As the EPA expects to be able to complete reconsideration of these regulatory
provisions expeditiously, the EPA does not believe this temporary extension will, as a practical matter, affect
the compliance dates for sources in Groups III, IV, or V since completion of the rulemaking is expected before April
24, 1995. If, following consideration of public comment, the EPA takes final action to extend these compliance dates,
the dates would be extended until the effective date of the EPA's final action following reconsideration of these
rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing this temporary extension of the compliance dates in order to complete reconsideration of the
rule, as discussed above. The EPA intends to complete its reconsideration of the rule and, following the notice and
comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, take appropriate action as expeditiously as practicable.
The EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the EPA's reconsideration.

A. Surge Control Vessels and Bottoms Receivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to the compliance date and the control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers will not affect the estimated emissions reduction and control cost for the rule. In the background analyses
used to characterize emissions, emission reductions, and control costs for this rule, the EPA treated surge control
vessels and bottoms receivers as either process vents or storage vessels. This approach was taken due to the lack of
sufficient data to characterize surge control vessels and bottoms receivers and the EPA's view that this equipment
could be best characterized as a storage vessel. Consequently, the proposed revisions to the compliance date and
the requirements of &sect;63.170 have no effect on the emission reductions or cost estimates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Compressors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to the compliance date for compressors provisions are estimated to have a negligible effect
on the emissions reduction due to the equipment leak control requirements. Emissions from compressors contribute
only a small portion of the estimated emissions from equipment leaks because there are very few compressors located
in SOCMI process units. Information from earlier EPA studies also shows that the majority of compressors in SOCMI
already meet most, if not all, of the equipment specifications in &sect;63.164. Moreover, because of the nature of
the equipment changes and the long lead time, the EPA believes the proposed revisions will not result in delays of installation
of required controls. These proposed revisions to subpart H are not expected to affect the estimated cost of compliance
with the rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's changes to the NESHAP would have a minor impact on the information collection burden estimates made previously.
The added provisions provide a mechanism to request compliance extensions and are not required reports. Therefore,
the ICR has not been revised.

The HON rule promulgated on April 22, 1994 was considered ``significant'' under Executive Order 12866 and a regulatory
impact analysis (RIA) was prepared. The amendments proposed today would revise compliance dates to provide the time
necessary for installation of controls and do not add any additional control requirements. The EPA believes that
these proposed amendments would have a negligible impact on the results of the RIA and the change is considered to be
within the uncertainty of the analysis. For the reasons discussed in section III, the impacts on emissions reduction
are also believed to be negligible.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 20, 1994, the President signed into law Pub. L. 103&hyph;382, the ``Improving America's Schools Act of
1994,'' amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Title I of the ESEA reauthorizes, for
a five-year period, programs currently under Chapter 1 of Title I of the ESEA. Programs under Title I are designed to
help disadvantaged children meet high academic standards and include programs operated by local educational agencies
in high-poverty schools (Part A), Even Start family literacy programs (Part B), programs for migratory children
(Part C), and prevention and intervention programs for children and youth who are neglected, delinquent, or at risk
of dropping out (Part D).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to encourage broad State and local flexibility in implementing programs under Title I. In
particular, the Department intends to issue regulations only where absolutely necessary_for example, where the
statute requires a regulation or where a regulation would provide flexibility for States, school districts, and
schools. The Department will also provide nonbinding guidance, including through a Policy Manual, respecting legal
and policy issues under the Title I programs. This nonregulatory guidance can serve to inform parents, schools, school
districts, States, and other affected parties of the flexibility that exists under the statute, including multiple
approaches that may be available in carrying out the statute's requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Secretary invites advice and recommendations from interested parties_including Federal, State,
and local administrators, parents, teachers, and members of local boards of education_concerning issues on which
regulations may be necessary or with respect to which nonregulatory guidance would be helpful to clarify statutory
ambiguities and to provide for flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Negotiated Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1601 of Title I requires that, before publishing any proposed regulations to implement programs under Title
I, the Assistant Secretary will establish a negotiated rulemaking process on issues involving a minimum of two key
provisions in the statute_``schoolwide programs'' and ``standards and assessment.'' Therefore, the Assistant
Secretary specifically invites comments on these two provisions, including whether and where regulations are necessary
and nonregulatory guidance would be helpful. The appendix to this notice describes the two statutory provisions
in greater detail and raises questions for consideration. Commenters should use this discussion to guide their thinking.
The discussion, however, is not intended to restrict the issues that commenters may address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Secretary will select individuals to participate in the negotiated rulemaking sessions to be held
in Washington, DC from among the individuals or groups providing advice and recommendations. The Secretary will
publish a separate notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 providing details about the negotiated rulemaking process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Invitation to Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This request for comments is designed to elicit the views of interested parties, particularly Federal, State, and
local administrators, parents, teachers, and members of local boards of education on regulatory issues under Title
I. In addition to inviting specific comments on schoolwide programs and standards and assessment, the Assistant
Secretary invites comments on other potential regulatory issues concerning provisions under Title I. Since the
Department intends to minimize regulations and support flexibility, the Assistant Secretary also seeks recommendations
concerning where guidance might be necessary. The Assistant Secretary requests that each commenter identify his
or her role in education and the perspective from which he or she views the educational system_either as a representative
of an association, agency, or school (public or private), or as an individual teacher, student, parent, or private
citizen. The Assistant Secretary urges each commenter to be specific regarding his or her recommendations, including
identifying the particular section of Title I pertinent to the comment.

Appendix_Questions for Consideration on Schoolwide Programs and Standards and Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Listed below are discussions and related questions for consideration on two Title I provisions_schoolwide programs
and standards and assessment_that are required by statute to be addressed during the negotiated rulemaking process.
The Assistant Secretary specifically invites comments on these questions but welcomes other comments, as well,
including whether regulations are necessary and whether nonregulatory guidance would be helpful.

Schoolwide Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1114 of Title I, a local educational agency (LEA) may use funds received under Part A of Title I, in combination
with other Federal, State, and local funds, to upgrade the entire educational program in schools in which not fewer
than 50 percent of the children enrolled are from low-income families or that are located in school attendance areas
in which not fewer that 50 percent of the children are from low-income families. (The poverty threshold is 60 percent
for the 1995&hyph;96 school year and decreases to 50 percent in subsequent school years.) A schoolwide program school
must conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of the performance of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 children in the school in relation to the State's content and performance standards and implement schoolwide reform
strategies that provide opportunities for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 children in the school to meet those standards.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_Under section 1114(b)(1)(B)(iv), each school operating a Title I schoolwide program must address the needs of all
children in the school, particularly children who are members of the target population of any program included in
the schoolwide program, and determine if those needs have been met.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to ensure that schoolwide program schools develop a comprehensive
plan that results in a coherent rather than fragmented instructional program while addressing the needs of specific
target populations?

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_For the Migrant Education Program (MEP), under section 1306(b)(3), a schoolwide program school must address the
needs of migratory children, identified through a Statewide migrant comprehensive plan required under section
1306(a), that result from the effects of the children's migratory lifestyle or that are needed to permit them to participate
effectively in school. Unlike the Part A program, a State MEP establishes a set of service priorities to govern the
expenditure of MEP funds within the State.

_Section 1114(b)(1)(H) requires a schoolwide program to ensure that students experiencing difficulty mastering
any of the standards required by section 1111(b) during the course of the school year are provided with effective,
timely additional assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_The provision for schoolwide programs is predicated on the assumption that a well-coordinated, comprehensive
schoolwide program that combines all available Federal resources to improve the effectiveness of the entire instructional
program in the school will help 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
 at-risk students in the school reach the State's challenging academic content and performance standards better
than fragmented, categorical programs aimed at specific target populations. Thus, section 1114(a)(4)(A) authorizes
the Secretary, through publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, to exempt schoolwide programs from statutory or regulatory provisions of any noncompetitive, formula grant program
or any discretionary grant program administered by the Department (with the exception of grant funds allocated under
the Individuals with Disabilities Act), if the intent and purposes of such other programs are met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to clarify this provision, particularly in the context of overall
school reform envisioned by schoolwide programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards and Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1111, each State must develop or adopt challenging content standards and student performance standards
that will be used by the State, its LEAs, and its schools to carry out Part A programs. These standards must include challenging
content standards in academic subjects that specify what children are expected to know and be able to do, contain coherent
and rigorous content, and encourage the teaching of advanced skills. The standards must also include challenging
student performance standards that are aligned with the State's content standards, describe two levels of high performance_proficient
and advanced_to determine how well children are mastering the State's content standards, and describe a third level
of performance_partially proficient_to provide complete information about the progress of lower-performing
children toward achieving the proficient and advanced levels of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State must also develop or adopt a set of high-quality assessments, including assessments in at least mathematics
and reading or language arts, that will be used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of each Title
I LEA and school in enabling children served under Part A and each State and local operating agency under Part C to meet
the State's student performance standards. Among other things, these assessments must be the same assessments used
to measure the performance of all children if the State measures the performance of all children, be aligned with the
State's content and performance standards, be used for purposes for which they are valid and reliable, and assess
progress in the academic subjects in which the State has adopted content and performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State has content and performance standards and assessments for all students developed under the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act or another process, the State must use those standards and assessments, modified if necessary,
to meet these requirements. If a State has not adopted State content and performance standards or assessments for
all students, the State must develop standards and assessments for students served under Part A and, where feasible,
Part C (according to section 1304(c)(5)) in subjects determined by the State, but including at least mathematics
and reading or language arts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(1), States are not required to submit their content and performance standards to the
Secretary. However, a State must demonstrate in its State plan that it has developed challenging content and performance
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to clarify what information a State must submit to enable the
Secretary to evaluate this portion of the State plan? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(7), a State that does not yet have the required assessments may propose to use a transitional
set of yearly Statewide assessments that will measure the performance of complex skills and challenging subject
matter. For any year during which a State uses transitional assessments, the State must devise a procedure for identifying
LEAs and schools in need of improvement that relies on accurate information about the educational progress of each
Title I LEA and school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department clarify the provisions governing transitional assessments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to promote high quality assessment systems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(3), a State's assessments must be administered at some time during grades 3&hyph;5,
grades 6&hyph;9, and grades 10&hyph;12. Under section 1116(c)(1)(B)(ii), a targeted assistance school (i.e.,
one that is not operating a schoolwide program) may be reviewed for accountability purposes on the progress of those
students that have been or are served under Part A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, is necessary to address accountability provisions for Title I schools that do not serve the
grade levels covered by the State's assessments or for schools in which Title I services are not provided at those grade
levels? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1111 requires that States use challenging standards and high-quality assessments in examining the
effectiveness of the Part A program at the school, LEA, and State levels. For the MEP, section 1304(c)(5) requires
that the effectiveness of State programs and their local projects will be assessed, where feasible, using the same
approaches and standards that will be used to assess the performance of students, schools, and LEAs under Part A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide on how to assess the effectiveness of State Migrant Education
programs, their local projects, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LEAs under Part A, that serve children who move across State lines? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1111(b)(2) requires that a State plan demonstrate what constitutes ``adequate yearly progress''
of Title I LEAs and schools toward enabling children to meet the State's performance standards. The statute further
specifies that States must define ``adequate yearly progress,'' consistent with guidelines established by the
Secretary, that results in continuous and substantial yearly improvement of each LEA and school sufficient to achieve
the goal of all children served under Part A meeting the State's proficient and advanced levels of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidelines should the Secretary establish? Should the guidelines be contained in regulations or in nonregulatory
guidance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(3)(I), a State's set of student assessments must ``enable results to be disaggregated''
within each State, LEA, and school for several categories of children. Likewise, under section 1114(b)(2)(A)(v),
a schoolwide program plan must provide ``for the collection of data on the achievement and assessment results of students''
disaggregated by the same categories. However, a schoolwide program must publicly report disaggregated data only
if statistically sound. Finally, section 1116(a)(4) requires an LEA to publicize the results of its annual review
of schools served under Part A in individual school performance profiles that include statistically sound disaggregated
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What clarification, if any, should the Department provide on the various provisions in Part A concerning disaggregation
of data? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Given the requirement of section 1111(b)(3)(E) that assessments involve multiple measures of student performance,
what guidance, if any, should the Department provide to help clarify how schools, LEAs, and SEAs review results to
determine whether adequate progress is being made?

Surplus Commodities

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Donations of commodities to needy households were initiated in 1981 as part of efforts to reduce stockpiles of government-owned
commodities. These donations responded to concern over the costs to taxpayers of storing vast quantities of foods,
while at the same time there were persons in need of food assistance. The Emergency Food Assistance Program was codified
in Title II of Public Law 98&hyph;8, the Emergency Food Assistance Act (EFAA) of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 612c note). Surplus
foods made available for distribution under the EFAA are limited to amounts determined by the Secretary to be in excess
of the quantities needed to carry out other programs, including Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) sales obligations
and domestic food assistance programs. The Secretary of Agriculture anticipates that 72 million pounds of surplus
butter will be acquired by the CCC under its price-support activities and made available for distribution through
TEFAP during Fiscal Year 1995. Although butter is the only surplus commodity expected to be available for TEFAP, the
Department may offer additional commodities, or a different amount of butter, depending on agricultural production,
market conditions and the distribution of donated foods to other domestic outlets.

Purchased Commodities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, the supply of available surplus commodities has been drastically reduced. These reductions are
the result of changes in the agricultural price-support programs which have brought supply and demand into better
balance, and accelerated donations and sales. Congress responded to the reduced availability of surplus commodities
with section 104 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;435, which added sections 213 and 214 to
the EFAA. Those sections require the Secretary to annually purchase, process, and distribute commodities for household
consumption in addition to those surplus commodities otherwise provided under TEFAP. In section 110 of the Hunger
Prevention Act, Congress also requires the Secretary to purchase, process and distribute commodities for soup kitchens
and food banks. USDA purchases commodities for these programs based in part on annual reports completed by distributing
agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Fiscal Year 1995, $25 million has been appropriated for purchasing, processing and distributing additional
commodities for household use. The Department anticipates purchasing for distribution to households through TEFAP
during Fiscal Year 1995 peanut butter, rice, dehydrated potatoes, and the following canned foods: green beans, peaches,
pears and tomatoes. The amounts of each item purchased will depend on the prices USDA must pay, as well as the quantity
of each item requested by the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Fiscal Year 1995, $40 million has been appropriated to purchase, process, and distribute commodities for further
distribution to soup kitchens and food banks. For such outlets, the Department anticipates the purchase of dehydrated
potatoes, frozen ground beef, frozen cut-up chicken, turkey roasts, and the following canned foods: green beans,
peaches, pears, tomatoes, and beef. The amounts of each item purchased will depend on the prices USDA must pay.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interagency group of governments responsible for implementing the President's Forest Plan in Deschutes Province
is forming an official advisory committee to obtain advice from involved agencies and interested publics. The committee
will provide advice regarding implementation of a comprehensive ecosystem management strategy for federal land
within the Deschutes Province. The Deschutes Province is bordered on the north by the Columbia River between Bonneville
and just north of Wasco. From Wasco, it follows the divide between the John Day and the Deschutes Rivers south to the
Mill Creek Wilderness on the Ochoco National Forest. It follows the northern edge of the Mill Creek Wilderness east
through the Ochoco Mountains along the southern boundary of the Bridge Creek Wilderness. From there it continues
east for approximately two miles then heads southeast to Wolf Mountain continuing along the ridge west of the John
Day River to the northernmost part of the Snow Mountain Ranger District (Ochoco National Forest). From there it switches
to a southwestern direction along the divide between areas draining into the Deschutes and those draining into Malheur
Lake down to Glass Butte. From Glass Butte it follows east through China Hat and almost to Newberry Crater where it turns
to the southwest to Spring Butte and Walker Mountain. From Walker Mountain it swings south to Chemult then heads west
up to Mt. Thielsen and the Cascades Crest. From there it follows along the Cascades Crest to the Columbia River. The
Deschutes Province includes the following hydrologic units: Middle Columbia-Hood, Lower Deschutes, Trout, Upper
Deschutes, Lower Crooked, Upper Crooked, Beaver-South Fork and the Little Deschutes. The 7.6 million acre Deschutes
Province has approximately 1,631,200 acres falling within the range of the northern spotted owl including 1,144,500
acres of National Forest System land and 40 acres of DOD ownership.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Phoenix District Office, and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Tonto National
Forest, are preparing a joint Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for proposed expansion of mine facilities of
Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation (CMMC). The mine is located near the Towns of Globe and Miami, in Gila County, Arizona.
CMMC has submitted a proposed Operating Plan (to be processed by BLM as a Mining Plan of Operations (MPO) and by USFS
as a Plan of Operations (POO). The plan proposes to expand the facilities at the existing mine and has been filed with
the BLM and the USFS, as required under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and Title V of the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976. The BLM and USFS have responsibility for analysis, review, and approval of the mining
plan. Preparation of the EIS will follow the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Code of Federal Regulations,
title 40, subpart 1500.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new MPO/POO proposes construction of three new leach facility areas referred to as: (1) The Oxhide leach facility,
(2) the BL leach facility, and (3) the GMC leach facility, together with the required ancillary facilities. The leach
facility areas will be used for the purpose of placement and subsequent leaching of copper-bearing ore mined from
reserves located entirely on lands owned by CMMC. The leach facilities will be constructed partially on federal lands
managed by the USFS and the BLM, and partially on lands solely owned by CMMC (see acreages in ``Supplementary Information
Section'' below). Ore placed on the leach pads will be treated with sulfuric acid leach solution. Copper bearing leach
solutions captured from leach pads will be processed into high quality cathode copper in existing solvent extraction
and electrowinning plants. In addition, an overburden deposition area (called Barney Overburden Site, or Barney
OB) is planned. The overburden deposition area will be constructed to accommodate uneconomic material removed from
the active mining operation. With the proposed expansion it is anticipated that the Oxhide, BL and GMC leach facilities
and Barney OB will operate for the life of the mining operations, which is estimated to be 16 to 20 years.

CMMC owns and operates a large open-pit mine and leach operation in the Globe-Miami mining district. The CMMC complex
in Miami also includes a smelter and a rod plant. Approximately 950 people are employed at the Cyprus Miami facility.
Additional surface area is needed for leach pads and associated facilities to ensure the continued and uninterrupted
production of high quality copper cathodes. The mine is located near the Towns of Globe and Miami, Arizona about 65
miles east of Phoenix on State Highway 60.

Planned activities would take place on a combination of public and private surface and mineral lands. The public lands
include lands managed both by the Tonto National Forest and BLM Phoenix District. Total new disturbance for the Oxhide
pad would be 386 acres (with 329 acres managed by USFS and 5 acres managed by BLM). Total new disturbance for the BL pad
would be 470 acres (with 184 acres managed by BLM and 203 acres managed by USFS). Total new disturbance for the GMC pad
would be 236 acres (114 acres managed by BLM). Total new disturbance for the Barney OB site would be 216 acres (52 acres
managed by BLM and 32 acres managed by USFS). Two stormwater impoundments would be created upstream of the BL pad site
in Little Pinto Canyon and Webster Gulch. Total acres of private and public disturbance for all facilities would be
1,308 acres. Total acres of public land disturbed by all sites would be 919 acres (564 acres managed by USFS and 355 acres
managed by BLM).

The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be developed by a third party contractor who has been approved by the
BLM and USFS. The contractor will use an interdisciplinary team to develop the document. The BLM and USFS will have
the joint responsibility for the content of the EIS. The comment period for the draft EIS is anticipated to be in the
summer of 1995. The comment period for the final EIS is anticipated to be the winter of 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation
in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS must structure their participation in their review
of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

To assist the USFS and BLM in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the
proposed project should be as specific as possible. Comments may address issues and concerns or the potential alternatives
to be considered in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 13, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Granite Mountain Timber
Sales, which included the Little Granite, Pebble and Baldy Timber Sales, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 27227). The notice of intent was revised on April 15, 1993 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 19646), in which the Baldy Timber Sale was dropped, and timelines for completion were extended. A Notice of Availability
for the draft EIS was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49996). Because of the current emphasis on fire recovery, watershed analysis and the Eastside
Ecosystem Management Project, the notice of intent is being cancelled, and no final EIS will be issued for the project.
The Forest expects to issue a new notice of intent to prepare an EIS for the project area in Spring of 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NASS is updating the weights and changing the construction of its indexes of prices received and paid by farmers. In
conjunction with the new index procedures, additional changes to the prices received and paid data series will be
made as itemized below. All changes will take effect beginning in January 1995 with data published in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Agricultural Prices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prices received and paid indexes are used in computing the parity prices that NASS is required by statute to publish
monthly (7 U.S.C. 1301(a)(1)(c)). The base or fixed weights used in constructing the indexes have become outdated
as the mix of commodities farmers produce and input items they purchase have changed and are expected to continue to
change over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major changes to the weights and construction of the price indexes and to the prices received and paid data series are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A 1990&hyph;92 reference and base period will replace the current 1977 reference and 1971&hyph;73 base period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Five-year moving average weights will replace the current fixed 1971&hyph;73 base period weights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Monthly marketing weights that reflect seasonal marketing patterns will be added for prices received commodities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The 36-month (1990&hyph;92) average prices used as base period prices for the prices received indexes will be
weighted by monthly volumes of farmers' sales. The current base period (1971&hyph;73) prices are simple averages.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The new indexes will be constructed by multiplying the ratios of the current prices to the base period prices by
the moving average weights (adjusted for seasonal marketing patterns for the prices received indexes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Crop coverage will be expanded in the prices received indexes, largely for fruits, vegetables, greenhouse/nursery
products, and specialty crops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Prices Paid Surveys for feed, fuels, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, retail seeds, and farm machinery will
be conducted annually in April. The prices paid indexes will still be updated quarterly based on changes in appropriate
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) component indexes. Prices Paid Surveys for autos and trucks, building materials,
farm supplies, motor supplies, and marketing containers will be discontinued. BLS component indexes will be used
to measure price changes for these and other input items. Feeder livestock price surveys will continue quarterly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Separate prices paid indexes for crop and livestock farms will be computed and published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The 1910&hyph;14=100 price indexes required by statute (7 U.S.C. 1301(a)(1)(c)) for computing parity prices
will be determined based on the changes in the new 1990&hyph;92=100 indexes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in January 1995, the new 1990&hyph;92 indexes will be published monthly in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agricultural Prices 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for prices received and quarterly for prices paid. The new 1990&hyph;92 based indexes will be constructed back to
1975. The revised 1910&hyph;14 indexes and the new 1990&hyph;92 indexes covering the 1975&hyph;93 period will be
published in a separate release by the end of January 1995. The old 1977 indexes, except for the fresh market fruit and
vegetable and seasonally adjusted prices received indexes, will be available upon request during 1995 but discontinued
thereafter. The fresh market fruit and vegetable indexes and the seasonally adjusted indexes now published for fresh
market fruits, fresh market vegetables, potatoes and dry beans, dairy products, and poultry and eggs will be discontinued
in January 1995. Prices paid estimates for building materials, farm and motor supplies, and new autos and trucks will
no longer be published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in the construction of the indexes will simplify updating the component items and reference periods while
maintaining appropriate weights. The new index procedures will provide long-term comparability in computing future
index numbers, reduce respondent burden, and better utilize existing Government data. The overall changes will
not have a significant effect on the levels of the prices received and prices paid indexes, and, therefore, will have
very little effect on the levels of parity prices.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Through Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships, ``SURFing the Physics Lab: A Partnership for AMO Physics''
will provide an opportunity for the Physics Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and
the National Science Foundation to join in partnership with American colleges and universities, stimulating outstanding
physics students to pursue scientific careers by exposing them to the world class atomic, molecular, optical and
radiation physicists and facilities in the NIST Physics Laboratory, and strengthening undergraduate AMO physics
curricula by forming the basis for ongoing collaborations. The NIST program director will work with physics department
chairs and directors of multi-disciplinary centers of excellence to identify outstanding undergraduates (including
graduating seniors) who would benefit from off-campus summer research in an honors academy environment. We recommend
a group of two candidates plus one alternate to be nominated by each institution, although larger or smaller groups
will be given equal consideration. The selected group of about twenty (20) students will spend approximately twelve
(12) weeks at the Physics Laboratory's Gaithersburg, MD campus, working one-on-one with NIST staff physicists;
actively engaged in projects that combine the quest for fundamental knowledge and direct applications to problems
of national importance; learning about non-academic alternatives for research careers; living science and seeing
how they can make a difference. The 12-week stipend for the summer of 1995 will be $3600. Students and NIST research
advisors will be paired based on the student's background and interests in the spring, to allow for adequate dialogue
between the students, the student's physics professors and NIST advisor about the intended project, to ensure that
the student arrives at NIST ready to contribute, and to prepare the student's physics professor for follow-up in the
fall. Good overlap of research interest will facilitate collaborations between NIST and the participating academic
partners. The students will collectively live in a nearby furnished apartment complex and participate in the many
NIST seminars and in a weekly SURFing the Physics Lab Summer Seminar Series. The students will all present a research
seminar at NIST and be encouraged to participate in a local or national scientific conference during the following
academic year. Given the significant lack of diversity in the present physics work force, we will aggressively seek
out competitive students from underrepresented groups or persons with disabilities. Costs for this program (stipend,
travel and housing) will be shared by NIST, NSF and the participating schools.

The Act of March 3, 1901, as amended (15 U.S.C. 278g&hyph;l) authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology
to expend up to 1 per centum of the funds appropriated for activities of NIST in any fiscal year, as the Director deems

Program Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The objective of this partnership will build upon a 1993 summer pilot program funded by NIST as a proof of concept and
the 1994 SURFing program partially funded by the NSF Physics Division as a Research Experience for Undergraduates
Site. Of the 40 students involved during the past two years about 40% were Hispanic Americans and 40% were African Americans,
half were women and 1 was legally blind. Between 20 to 50% of the associated student stipends, travel and housing was
provided in cost sharing by the individual participating institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIST is the nation's premiere institute for the physical sciences and, as the lead agency for technology transfer,
is providing a strong interface between government, industry, and academia; on-site researchers at NIST come from
a broad range of colleges and industries. Owing to its unique mission to support the U.S. economy by working with industry,
NIST embodies a special science culture, developed from a large and well equipped research staff that enthusiastically
blends programs that address the immediate needs of industry with longer-term research that anticipates future
needs. This occurs in few other places and enables the Physics Laboratory to offer unique research and training opportunities
for undergraduates, providing them a research-rich environment and exposure to state of the art equipment, to scientists
at work and to professional contacts that represent future employment possibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attending to the long term needs of many U.S. high-technology industries, NIST's Physics Lab conducts basic research
in the areas of quantum, electron, optical, atomic, molecular, and radiation physics. This is complemented by applied
research devoted to overcoming barriers to the next technological revolution, in which individual atoms and molecules
will serve as the fundamental building blocks of electronic and optical devices. To achieve these goals, staff develop
and utilize highly specialized equipment, such as polarized electron microscopes, scanning tunneling microscopes,
lasers, and x-ray and synchrotrons radiation sources. Research projects can be theoretical or experimental, and
will range in focus from quantum electrodynamics, through trapping atoms and choreographing molecular collisions,
to ionizing radiation. SURFers will work one-on-one with our nation's top physical scientists both from NIST and
from some of our nation's leading, high tech industries. It is anticipated that successful SURFers will move from
a position of reliance on guidance from their research advisors to one of research independence during the twelve
week period. One goal of this partnership is to provide opportunities for our nation's next generation of scientists
and engineers to engage in world class scientific research at NIST, especially in ground breaking areas of emerging
technologies. This carries with it the hope of motivating these individuals to pursue a Ph.D. in physics, and to consider
alternative research careers. SURFing the Physics Lab will attempt to forge partnerships with NSF and with post-secondary
institutions that demonstrate strong, hands-on undergraduate science curricula, especially those with a demonstrated
commitment to the education of women, minorities and students with disabilities. This program will be open to all
U.S. citizens interested in AMO physics.

Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This NIST invention describes a perflourinated ionomer membrane having improved transport characteristics. A
surfactant species is added to a polymer mixture prior to film casting. The resulting membranes have a measurably
altered membrane microstructure and improved transport characteristics over prior art membranes. This NIST invention
describes the method of producing the improved membranes. The membranes of this NIST invention are useful in a number
of separation processes, including the separation of NH

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 22, August 12 and September 2, 1994, the Committee for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices (59 F.R. 19164, 41434 and 45666) of proposed additions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and deletions from the Procurement List: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Additions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the services proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following services are hereby added to the Procurement List:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This patent concerns a revetment unit for protecting shoreline or waterway embankments from erosion caused by waves
or currents. The object of the invention is to provide a revetment unit which has simplified design and enhanced interlocking
capabilities when arranged with other identical units into a protective matrix covering. The unit is generally L-shaped,
has a low center of gravity for stability, and maximizes area covered per unit weight. The units form a matrix which
has sufficient porosity to allow drainage and prevent excessive water pressure under the units. A model revetment
formed from the units has been tested in a laboratory wave flume at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station.
The units have demonstrated a high stability coefficient when subjected to the action of water waves.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision for Realignment of Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Illinois</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations for implementing NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces
its decision to implement realignment of Naval Training Center (NTC) Great Lakes, Illinois. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the legislative requirements of the Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Public Law [P.L.]
101&hyph;510), the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC&hyph;93) recommended the closure
of NTC Orlando, Florida and NTC San Diego, California. The majority of naval training at these bases will be relocated
to NTC Great Lakes, Illinois. In addition, Naval Technical Training Center (NTTC) Treasure Island, and Combat Systems
Technical Schools Command (CSTC) Mare Island, California, will be closed pursuant to the recommendations of BRAC&hyph;93,
with some of the training at these commands relocated to NTC Great Lakes. Also associated with this section is relocation
of the Navy Recruiting Command (COMNAVCRUITCOM) from Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Draft Environmental Impact Statement was prepared for the action and distributed to Federal, State, and local agencies
and to interested individuals and groups. Public comments and Navy responses to those comments were incorporated
into the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) which was distributed to the public for a review period that
ended on October 15, 1994. This review resulted in a single letter from the Office of the Governor, Illinois State Clearinghouse,
stating that the action is not in conflict with State plans, policies, and priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The realignment will increase the number of average on-board service school students by approximately 2,088 between
1993 and 1998. The number of permanent-party naval personnel necessary to support service and apprentice school
training will increase by approximately 243 over the same period. Twenty-four construction projects are required
to accommodate the realignment at NTC Great Lakes. The projects include upgrades of existing facilities and new construction
to support new functions and increased number of students and permanent-party personnel. All associated construction
and renovation projects addressed in the FEIS will occur at NTC Great Lakes, with the exception of a family housing
project. This project will construct 240 family housing units at the Navy-owned Glenview Annex. Another BRAC&hyph;93
decision directed closure of Naval Air Station (NAS) Glenview and allowed for portions of NAS Glenview to be retained
by Navy for the family housing requirements of NTC Great Lakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act waived certain aspects of NEPA such that the environmental analysis
need not consider the no-action alternative (no realignment). Alternative means of accommodating the mandated
BRAC&hyph;93 realignment at NTC Great Lakes that were considered and included the use of existing structures and
alternative sites for construction of new facilities. Sites considered at NTC Great Lakes for the new facilities/renovations
avoided environmentally sensitive areas, then were selected based on the following functional considerations:
adequacy of existing structures for the proposed uses, availability of utilities, and proximity of the barracks
to existing and related facilities, such as classrooms and the galley. Glenview Annex is selected as the most environmentally
preferred and functionally desirable alternative considered for the family housing project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction of the new facilities will convert less than four acres of lawn area to impervious buildings and pavement
surfaces. There will be no significant impacts to surface water or wetlands. With erosion mitigation and through
sedimentation control described in the FEIS in place, any potential for localized decreases in the quality of stormwater
runoff during construction will be minimal and temporary. There will be no significant impacts to groundwater or
potable water resources as a result of the realignment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The action will cause no significant impact to ambient noise levels or air quality. Localized, temporary impacts
will occur during construction and demolition activities. Compliance with State (Title 35, Section 228) and Federal
regulations, including National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), will be achieved during
removal of asbestos-containing materials. NTC Great Lakes is located in a non-attainment area for ozone. An applicability
analysis was performed for air pollutant emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and volatile organic material (VOM) in compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and 1993 final rule for
determining conformity of federal actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans (40 CFR Parts 6, 51, and 93). The
analysis included construction-related emissions, mobile-source emissions, and stationary-source emissions
associated with the realignment. Neither NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nor VOM emissions estimates for any year of the action exceeded the de minimis levels of 25 tons per year. Therefore,
the action is presumed to conform to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and is exempted from any further requirements
of the General Conformity Rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action at NTC Great Lakes will not impact any Department of Defense Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites.
The action will not violate any conditions of the NTC Great Lakes Waste Management Plan or the Spill Prevention Control
and Countermeasures Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Remedial Investigation is currently underway at Glenview Annex to determine the extent of contamination at an IRP
site (former fire fighting training area) where it intersects the eastern portion of the family housing site. Also,
based on a review of historic aerial photographs as part of the BRAC cleanup plan for the closure of NAS Glenview, the
previous existence of three ordnance magazines and a trap/skeet range may exist on a portion of the new family housing
area. Contaminated soils that exceed regulatory levels will be remediated prior to construction in accordance with
applicable federal and state requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in population from the action will be small in comparison with the existing populations in Lake County
and the Chicago metropolitan area, and will not result in significant impacts to facilities or services on-base or
in the region. The additional economic activity from the action will result in a net positive effect on the local economy.
The action will not significantly impact existing land uses at NTC Great Lakes, in the City of North Chicago, or the
Village of Lake Bluff. The action will provide a net increase of 206 new family housing units at the Glenview Annex family
housing area because 34 units of existing family housing will be replaced. The additional vehicular traffic generated
by the action will not be significant and the cumulative impact is anticipated to be less than 1990 levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action will increase the number of school-aged children by an estimated 312 students, with an estimated 122 students
being dispersed throughout the local communities as a result of naval personnel living off-base. The remaining 190
students are expected to reside in the NAS Glenview family housing. Based on current distribution of naval personnel
living off-base, the 122 additional students will attend schools in the communities surrounding NTC Great Lakes
and the impacts to individual schools will be minimal. Of the 190 students expected to reside at NAS Glenview, it is
estimated that 38 students will attend District 225 schools and the remaining 152 students will attend District 34
schools. District 225 officials consider school capacity to be sufficient and financial impacts to be negligible.
District 34 has indicated that an additional 152 students would have a negative impact on district facilities and
finances, and could require six to seven new classrooms. The school district should receive Federal Impact Aid reimbursement
for lost property taxes for each family residing at Glenview Annex. This will serve to equalize the contribution from
Glenview Annex residents with those of the local community for education support. Additionally, it is expected that
the conversion of much of the currently non-taxable NAS Glenview property to commercial, industrial, office, and
other taxable property will have a positive impact on District 34 revenues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utilities at NTC Great Lakes and at the NAS Glenview family housing site have adequate capacity to serve the additional
personnel at both sites. NTC is allowed to discharge up to 10.5 million gallons per day (mgd) to the local wastewater
treatment authority, and the realignment will bring the total NTC discharge to 2.8 mgd. The wastewater treatment
facility serving Glenview Annex has 180 mgd excess capacity, and will be able to accommodate the additional 0.2 mgd
discharge from the Navy family housing units. Police and fire protection services are also adequate to serve the needs
of the new facilities. An expansion of the medical and dental facilities at NTC Great Lakes is programmed to meet the
needs of the additional incoming students and staff population. On-base community and recreational services and
facilities are adequate to serve the needs of the larger population at both NTC Great Lakes and the NAS Glenview family
housing area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action will result in no significant impacts to plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered by either
federal or state agencies. Potential impacts to cultural resources at NTC Great Lakes have been evaluated in compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Renovations will be undertaken for four buildings
(Building 4, 177, 178, and 179) in the National Historic District at NTC Great Lakes. However, only building 4 is a contributing
property of major significance within the historic district. All modifications to this building will be approved
by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA) during the early phases of project design. The IHPA has determined
that no significant historic, architectural, or archeological resources are located in the Glenview Annex project
area.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In January 1991, the then Secretary of Energy announced that the Department would prepare a programmatic environmental
impact statement (PEIS) examining alternatives for the reconfiguration of the nuclear weapons complex (the Complex).
The framework for the Reconfiguration PEIS was described in the January 1991 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration Study
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Reconfiguration Study), a detailed examination of alternatives for the future Complex. Because of the significant
changes in the world since January 1991, especially with regard to projected future requirements for the United States'
nuclear weapons stockpile, the Department has concluded that the framework described in the Reconfiguration Study
does not exist today. Contributing factors to this conclusion include public comments at the September-October
1993 PEIS scoping meetings, the fact that no new nuclear weapons production is required for the foreseeable future,
budget constraints, and the Department's decision to prepare a separate PEIS on Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable
Fissile Nuclear Materials. As a result of these changed circumstances, the Department is proposing to separate the
Reconfiguration PEIS into two PEISs: (1) a Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS to be completed in November 1995; and
(2) a Stockpile Stewardship and Management PEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Stockpile stewardship includes activities required to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability,
and performance of nuclear weapons in the absence of underground testing, and to be prepared to test weapons if directed
by the President. Stockpile management activities include maintenance, evaluation, repair or replacement of weapons
in the existing stockpile. To define a new stockpile stewardship and management proposal, the Department is reviewing
its nuclear weapons complex stockpile stewardship and management activities. This review will take into account
the latest information concerning current and projected future stockpile requirements. To assist the Department
in defining a new proposal, the Department intends to hold a public meeting in early 1995 to receive comments on how
to conduct the scoping process for the Stockpile Stewardship and Management PEIS, and to have preliminary discussions
on potential alternatives. This will be followed by public scoping meetings later in 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the meantime, the Department will continue to evaluate alternatives for tritium supply and recycling in a Tritium
Supply and Recycling PEIS. While the focus of this PEIS will be on alternatives for a long-term, assured supply of tritium,
the PEIS also will include an assessment of the environmental and institutional impacts associated with using one
or more commercial light water reactors for tritium production as a contingency in the event of a national emergency.
Specific commercial reactors will not be identified in this PEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to provide the public with an update regarding DOE's intentions for National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) review of elements of the future Complex, and to request comments on the Tritium Supply and Recycling
PEIS proposal. An Implementation Plan (IP) for the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS will be issued after comments
on this notice have been received and considered. The IP will explain more fully the scope of the Tritium Supply and
Recycling PEIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In January 1991, the goal of the Reconfiguration program was, as it is now, to make the Complex smaller, less diverse,
and less costly to operate. At the time, the projected production levels were much smaller than historic levels, but
much larger than they are today. The document that provided the framework for the original proposal was the January
1991 Reconfiguration Study. That document was the result of many months of effort by a task force which thoroughly
reviewed the status and capabilities of the weapons complex against projected future requirements. As a result of
that effort, the Department envisioned that the future Complex would consist of fewer sites, and that missions might
be relocated to achieve consolidation, greater efficiency, and significant long-term cost savings. Indeed, as
a result of the Secretary's decision last year approving the nonnuclear consolidation proposal (which had been separated
from the original Reconfiguration PEIS effort), weapons complex functions will be terminated at three sites and
significant cost savings will be achieved within a short period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Reconfiguration PEIS was to establish the locations for the future weapons complex missions. It
was envisioned that, once future mission locations were established through the PEIS process, project-specific
environmental analyses would follow the PEIS and cover in detail the projects necessary to implement the PEIS decisions
at each site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the Reconfiguration PEIS scope, potential relocation and consolidation of the ``nuclear'' missions of the
complex (i.e., plutonium and uranium component fabrication and processing, weapons assembly and disassembly,
tritium supply and recycling, and fissile materials storage) were being analyzed. In order to relocate any of these
missions at the assumed levels of production, major new construction would have been required, entailing significant
(billions of dollars) ``up-front'' cost with a ``pay-back'' period significantly longer than for nonnuclear consolidation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the end of the Cold War, the projected long hiatus in the need for new nuclear weapons production, and the budget
constraints that are anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future, the framework presented in the January
1991 Reconfiguration Study no longer fits current circumstances or supports any realistic proposal for reconfiguration
of the nuclear weapons complex. Therefore, the Department intends to separate the Reconfiguration proposal into
two parts, and will prepare a PEIS on each part. The first PEIS is the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, which will address
the need for tritium. The second is the Stockpile Stewardship and Management PEIS, which will address the rest of the
complex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist in the development of a Stockpile Stewardship and Management proposal, the Department intends to involve
stakeholders in early 1995 through a meeting in advance of formal scoping. The goal of this approach is to enable stakeholders
to have an active role in developing the Stockpile Stewardship and Management proposal, rather than reacting to a
proposal developed solely by the Department. The Department expects to develop a proposal after this initial meeting,
and to issue a Notice of Intent before public scoping meetings later in 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department currently has no capability for the production of tritium, which decays at a rate of approximately
five percent per year, and which is required for every active weapon in the stockpile. Current projections indicate
that new tritium is required to be available in the 2011&hyph;2015 time frame. Depending upon the alternative selected,
it could take up to fifteen years or more for a tritium source, once selected, to begin producing tritium. Not only is
planning for a new, assured tritium supply required to begin now to meet projected stockpile requirements, but the
Department must meet a statutory deadline of March 1, 1995, to issue a PEIS addressing tritium supply alternatives.
Therefore, the Department intends to separate the tritium supply and recycling alternatives from the future Stockpile
Stewardship and Management proposal. The following discussion outlines the history of the Reconfiguration program,
and the current proposal for tritium supply and recycling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Original Reconfiguration Plan (February 1991 to July 1993) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
An NOI to prepare a PEIS for Reconfiguration of the Nuclear Weapons Complex was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5590). That NOI proposed to study the options presented in the Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration
Study (DOE/DP&hyph;0083) of January 1991. A series of 15 public scoping meetings were held around the country to solicit
comments regarding the Reconfiguration proposal. At that time, alternatives for a new tritium supply facility were
being evaluated in a separate New Production Reactor (NPR) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In November 1991,
however, in response to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions which delayed the need for a new tritium supply facility,
the then Secretary of Energy announced that the analysis of NPR alternatives would be incorporated into the Reconfiguration
PEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An IP for the Reconfiguration PEIS was published in February 1992. The IP summarized the comments received during
scoping, including incorporation of the NPR analysis into Reconfiguration, described the scope of the Reconfiguration
program, the alternatives that were to be evaluated, and the methodology for preparing the PEIS.

Program Changes (July 1993 to April 1994) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the publication of the original IP in February 1992, additional major reductions in the nuclear weapons stockpile
resulted in significant program changes. As a result of these changes, a revised NOI for the PEIS was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39528). Changes in the scope of the Reconfiguration PEIS reflected the fact that the future Complex
could be smaller and more integrated than previously envisioned, and placed increased importance on stewardship
of existing special nuclear materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the public scoping period from July&hyph;October 1993, many members of the public questioned why the Department
planned to analyze new nuclear weapon facilities in general, and new nuclear weapon component fabrication facilities
in particular, given the lack of requirements for new nuclear weapons and an otherwise limited workload. There was
a perception among many members of the public that evaluation of new facilities in the PEIS indicated an intention
to construct those facilities in a predetermined time frame. Based upon this feedback, and a resulting reevaluation
of known and projected requirements for weapons complex work for the next decade, the Department believes that the
lack of any foreseeable need for new nuclear weapons, together with higher priority budget needs (both for the Department
and the Nation), make it unnecessary and inappropriate to consider most types of new weapons production facilities,
except for tritium facilities, at this time. Moreover, the Department has been directed, both by the President and
the Congress, to establish a program for maintaining the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile
without nuclear testing. This new program, entitled Stockpile Stewardship, is expected to require new diagnostic
facilities and capabilities. As described above, efforts to formulate a new proposal for Stockpile Stewardship
and Management will be initiated in 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a new, separate project has been initiated by the Secretary of Energy to consider alternatives for: (1)
long-term storage of separated fissile nuclear materials (primarily plutonium and highly enriched uranium), whether
stored for defense purposes or surplus to defense needs; and (2) disposition of surplus fissile nuclear materials.
The environmental impacts associated with these options are being analyzed in the Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable
Fissile Nuclear Materials PEIS, currently in preparation. The establishment of that project has further reduced
the scope of the previously-envisioned Reconfiguration PEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Current Proposal for Tritium Supply and Recycling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal for tritium supply and recycling includes the evaluation of technology and siting alternatives. The
Department intends to identify a preferred technology and siting alternative in the Draft Tritium Supply and Recycling
PEIS. Four different technologies to supply tritium in a new facility will be assessed in the PEIS: Heavy Water Reactor
(HWR); Modular High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (MHTGR); Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) [both a large reactor
design and a smaller reactor design]; and Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, five candidate sites are being considered for new tritium facilities: the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory (INEL); the Nevada Test Site (NTS); the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) in Tennessee; the Pantex Plant near
Amarillo, Texas; and the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tritium recycling mission includes removing, separating, and purifying tritium gas contained in tritium reservoirs
from returned weapons, receiving new tritium from the tritium supply plant, blending the recycled tritium and the
new tritium, and loading the tritium mixture into new or used reservoirs for shipment to the Pantex Plant for weapons
assembly operations. Currently, tritium recycling is conducted at SRS. If a new tritium supply facility were to be
located at SRS, tritium recycling would stay at SRS and be upgraded. If a tritium supply facility were constructed
elsewhere, either a new tritium recycling facility would be collocated with it and the facilities at SRS phased out
(thus terminating the defense mission at SRS), or the tritium recycling facilities at SRS would be upgraded. No-action
alternatives for each of the sites where tritium facilities may be located will provide a baseline for comparison
of the environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department intends to include, in the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, an assessment of the environmental
and institutional impacts associated with using one or more commercial light water reactors for tritium production
as a contingency in the event of a national emergency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the purpose of the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS is focused on assessing the reasonable alternatives for
a government-owned, long-term, assured supply of tritium, programmatic NEPA coverage of this contingency option,
which would only be needed in the event of a national emergency, would ensure that the public is informed of the Department's
overall planning for meeting tritium requirements_both contingency (until a long-term, assured source is on line)
and long-term. This analysis would be generic and would not identify any specific commercial reactors that might
be used if such an option were ever required to be implemented.

Public Involvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's initiatives for further public involvement in the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS are intended
to provide the public complete, accurate, and timely information, and to facilitate effective participation in
the NEPA process. The initiatives include a series of fact sheets describing various aspects of the Tritium Supply
and Recycling PEIS as well as other program activities. These fact sheets will be mailed to those on the program mailing
list throughout the remainder of 1994 and 1995. To provide substantial opportunities for feedback to the Department,
the initiatives include the use of a toll-free telephone number; placement of program information, including this
notice, on an electronic bulletin board to enable comments and feedback to be transmitted electronically; and a speakers
bureau to fulfill requests for DOE officials to speak with the public. In addition, once the Tritium Supply and Recycling
draft PEIS is published, the public will be invited to review and comment on the document. During the comment period,
the Department will conduct a series of interactive workshops to provide further explanation of information in the
document and to provide the public with an opportunity to present comments, questions, and concerns, and to discuss
them with DOE officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is in the process of updating the mailing list for the Tritium Supply and Recycling program and the Stockpile Stewardship
and Management program. A fact sheet on this notice, along with a mailback response form, is being sent to all those
on the current Reconfiguration mailing list. The purpose of the mailback response form is to allow individuals and
organizations to indicate their continuing interest in receiving information regarding either the Tritium Supply
and Recycling program or the Stockpile Stewardship and Management program. Interested parties wishing to remain
on the mailing list for either the Tritium Supply and Recycling program or the Stockpile Stewardship and Management
program must complete and return the mailback response form or call 1&hyph;800&hyph;776&hyph;2765 with the same
request.

The Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS will identify and analyze direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts resulting
from the tritium supply and recycling alternatives. These include potential impacts from constructing and operating
the proposed facilities, including: impacts to air quality, water resources, plants and animals, land use, historic
resources, archaeological sites; socioeconomic impacts; impacts associated with generating radiological and
nonradiological wastes; impacts associated with transporting radioactive materials; and the potential consequences
of both normal and accidental radiological and nonradiological releases on the public and worker health and safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on October 13, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243&hyph;1902,
filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;20&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216(b) of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.216(b)) for authorization to abandon the South Stevens
Point Meter Station located in Portage County, Wisconsin, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;480&hyph;000,
pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANR is seeking abandonment authority because the station consists of two, 8-inch orifice meters which are oversized
for the present volume demand. ANR proposes to abandon the South Stevens Point Meter Station because to use the station
would require unnecessary and expensive downsizing to provide accurate measurement. In Docket No. CP94&hyph;713&hyph;000,
ANR proposes to construct a new interconnection (Rosholt Interconnection) to provide continued service to Wisconsin
Public Service Corporation (Public Service). ANR will continue to provide service through the South Stevens Point
Meter Station until the new Rosholt Interconnection is in place and in service. ANR states that the abandonment will
not result in any interruption of service. Public Service is the only customer served by this meter station. The cost
of the facilities to be abandoned is approximately $61,000.

Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas
77001, filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for authority to abandon by sale to Anadarko
Gathering Company (AGC) a portion of Panhandle's pipeline and compressor facilities located in Seward, Morton and
Stevens Counties, Kansas and Texas County, Oklahoma, and located west of its Liberal Compressor Station, and to abandon
by transfer to Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), its subsidiary, 10 units of a compressor station
located in Morton County, Kansas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Panhandle states that, in a further effort to improve the jurisdictional pipeline operations of the facilities located
west of its Haven, Kansas Compressor Station, the abandonment proposed herein would enable Panhandle to streamline
its jurisdictional operations, to reduce its existing transportation rates and to assure producers and shippers
that gathering services in the future would not only continue to be available but would be provided on a more efficient
and competitive basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle proposes to abandon by sale to AGC approximately 126 miles of pipeline, ranging in size of 6-inch to 26-inch
in diameter, 7 compressor stations, and 8 measuring and regulating stations, as more fully described in Exhibits
Z-1 and Z-2 of its application. Panhandle states that the facilities would be sold at the book value of the facilities,
$22,700,000. Panhandle also states that, in addition to the purchase price, AGC has also agreed to pay Panhandle $4.0
million to cover environmental-related costs and $1.3 million to cover the costs associated with the modifications
to the Elkhart Station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is indicated that Panhandle states that the purchase of its Hugoton Area facilities by AGC, who currently has a gathering
system in a portion of the Hugoton Area, the HUGS System, would eliminate the need for the further construction by AGC
of duplicative facilities and would allow Panhandle to continue its effort to utilize and operate its system in the
most efficient manner and in an effort to continue providing the best service it can to its customers. Panhandle further
states that the authorization of the abandonment would serve the public interest by reducing jurisdictional rate
base and related cost of service, thereby having an impact on Panhandle's current Field Zone transmission rates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle also proposes to abandon by transfer to Field Services 10 units at the Elkhart Compressor Station located
in Morton County, Kansas. Panhandle indicates that, if the remaining units at the station were not transferred to
Field Services, they would become a non-contiguous isolated compressor station in the middle of gathering systems
operated by AGC and Field Services. Panhandle states that these facilities would be transferred to Field Services
at the net book value of those facilities, $1,472,440.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Anadarko Gathering Company (AGC), 17001 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas 77251,
filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP95&hyph;22&hyph;000, as supplemented on October 17, 1994,
requesting that the Commission declare that AGC's proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of certain natural
gas gathering systems and other facilities currently owned by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) would
not subject AGC or any portion of its facilities or services to the jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all
as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGC seeks a declaratory order finding that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facilities described in its petition that AGC wishes to acquire from Panhandle will be gathering facilities
exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AGC will not be a ``natural gas company'' pursuant to Section 2 of the Natural Gas Act by virtue of its proposed
acquisition, ownership, and operation of such facilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The gathering services to be performed by AGC will be non-jurisdictional gathering services exempt from the
Commission's jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AGC's rates, and charges for gathering services will not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant
to Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGC states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko). AGC indicates that
it would acquire facilities directly from Panhandle as well as facilities currently owned by Panhandle but proposed
in Docket No. CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000 to be transferred to Panhandle Field Services Company, Panhandle's affiliate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is indicated that recently Panhandle and AGC (APC) concluded negotiations concerning the sale to AGC of Panhandle's
Hugoton System. It is indicated that AGC's affiliate, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) produces approximately
76 percent of the natural gas connected to the subject facilities. AGC states that, subsequent to the transfer of facilities
by Panhandle, it would upgrade the subject facilities to maximize productive capacities of the wells connected to
the system. AGC also indicates that it would offer continuity of service to all existing gathering customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is argued that the facilities to be transferred to AGC meet the physical and non-physical criteria for determining
gathering as set forth in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Farmland Industries, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23 FERC &para; 61.063 (1983), as modified by subsequent Commission orders. AGC states that the vast majority of the
1,147 miles of pipe are short in length and range from 2 to 26 inches in diameter, with 71 percent being 10 inches or less
in diameter. AGC indicates that of the 29 percent of the facilities 12 inches in diameter or larger, all but 31 miles
of the pipe are located behind field booster stations. AGC also indicates that the 31 miles of pipe on the discharge
side of the Hugoton Compressor Station still serve to aggregate area gas production. Also, AGC submits that all of
the facilities are located upstream of the Liberal Compressor Station, which it indicates is the central point in
the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, AGC states that virtually all of the gathering systems are web-like or rib-like in configuration, with
the facilities being located in a production area forming a network of short-length pipelines originating at wells
and connecting to aggregation points. It is also indicated that the gathering facilities contain a total of 57 field
booster compressor stations. AGC indicates that the suction pressures of the booster stations range from 30 to 375
psig, with 46 of the 57 stations having a suction pressure of less than 100 psig. AGC also states that wells are located
all along the facilities. With respect to the operating pressure of the lines, a review of the operational pressures
reveals that 87 percent of the pipelines operate below 100 psig, 10 percent operate above 100 psig but less than 450
psig, and 31 miles of pipe operate at above 450 psig. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the non-physical criteria, AGC notes that Anadarko, its affiliate is primarily engaged in the exploration
and production of natural gas and petroleum, with a working interest in 833 wells attached to the subject facilities.
AGC also indicates that substantial effort would be expended to upgrade the gathering facilities to maximize the
efficient production on natural gas benefitting both producers with wells connected to the gathering facilities
and consumers consistent with the objectives of the NGA, Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and the Commission's Order
No. 636. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGC requests that its petition be consolidated with Panhandle's abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;21&hyph;000
which involves the abandonment by sale to Anadarko of a portion of the facilities at issue in AGC's petition.

Field Services seeks a declaratory order finding that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Panhandle's South Elkhart Station and related facilities in Morton County, Kansas are facilities to be used
for the gathering of natural gas and therefore exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b)
of the Natural Gas Act;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is indicated that recently Panhandle and Anadarko Gathering Company (AGC) concluded negotiations concerning
the sale to AGC of Panhandle's Hugoton System. Field Services states that the sale of the Hugoton System to AGC includes
a portion of the Elkhart Compressor Station in Kansas. It is stated that Panhandle proposes to sell a part of the Elkhart
Station facilities to AGC and the remainder would be transferred to Field Services with Field Services operating
its portion of the Elkhart Station facilities in conjunction with the other gathering facilities it is acquiring
from Panhandle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also stated that, as currently configured, the Elkhart Station is located in Morton County, Kansas immediately
downstream of gathering facilities which are the subject of the Panhandle and Field Services' filings in Docket Nos.
CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;152&hyph;000, respectively. Field Services indicates that the Elkhart
Station is divided by a county road, but the two portions are currently integrated. It is also stated that, as a result
of the sale of the Panhandle Hugoton System to AGC, Panhandle proposes to split the Elkhart Station between AGC and
Field Services. It is indicated that Panhandle would transfer the portion south of the county road, consisting of
four 1,028 horsepower two-stage skid-mounted compressors and six 1,100 horsepower single-stage block-mounted
compressors, to Field Services. Field Services states that these facilities compress the gas gathered on the Elkhart
Gathering System for delivery into the 24-inch line to be transferred to AGC. Field Services states that the portion
of the facilities located north of the county road, consisting of one 3,162 horsepower four-stage compressor, would
be transferred to AGC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field Services states that, subsequent to the transfer of facilities by Panhandle, significant modifications would
be undertaken to separate completely the operation of the South Elkhart Station from the North Elkhart Station so
that the two would be operated independently and would no longer be integrated. It is also indicated that, upon the
transfer of the Panhandle Hugoton Gathering System to AGC and the transfer of the remaining gathering to Field Services,
the South Elkhart Station would not be contiguous with any other facilities owned or operated by Panhandle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field Services argues that, as a matter of law, the facilities to be transferred to Field Services are within the gathering
and production exemption of Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act because; and that, after the reconfiguration of facilities,
the sole function of the South Elkhart Station would be to boost the pressure of the gas produced behind the station
from a suction pressure of 50 psig to a pressure high enough (450 psig) so that the gas can be delivered into the 24-inch
discharge line.

Take notice that on October 20, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP74&hyph;33&hyph;015 pursuant to Section 7(c)
of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to recomplete an existing well as an injection/withdrawal well and
connect the well to the Washington Storage Field

 in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application on file which is open to the public for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL proposes to recomplete Well No. 62 as an injection/withdrawal well into the main storage reservoir and connect
the well to the Washington Storage Field with approximately 3,800 feet of 4-inch diameter pipe. TGPL states that the
proposed recompletion of Well No. 62 would not increase the injection, withdrawal, or storage capacity of TGPL's
Washington Storage Field above currently certificated levels; rather it would replace the decline in deliverability
from certain existing wells in the field that has occurred over time. TGPL states that the proposed recompletion of
Well No. 62 would restore physical operational flexibility to better serve its FERC Rate Schedule WSS storage customers.
TGPL estimates that it would cost $337,765 to recomplete Well No. 62.

Region 9 has determined that disclosure of CBI to ICF is necessary in order that they may carry out the work required
by that contract with EPA. The contract complies with all requirements of 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2)(ii), incorporated by
reference into 40 CFR 2.310(h)(2). EPA Region 9 will require that each ICF employee sign a written agreement that he
or she: (1) Will use the information only for the purpose of carrying out the work required by the contract, (2) shall
refrain from disclosing the information to anyone other than EPA without the prior written approval of each affected
business or of an EPA legal office, and (3) shall return to EPA all copies of the information (and any abstracts or extracts
therefrom) upon request from the EPA program office, whenever the information is no longer required by ICF for performance
of the work required by the contract. These non-disclosure statements shall be maintained on file with the Project
Officer. ICF employees will be trained on Superfund CBI requirements.

NOTICE OF REQUIRED DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT PROVISIONS AND OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'') as amended, (commonly
known as ``Superfund'') requires completion of enforcement activities at Superfund sites in concert with other
site events. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires that EPA provide requested information to other parties.
EPA has entered into a contract, No. 68&hyph;W9&hyph;0046, with Weston for enforcement and FOIA support services.
EPA Region 9 has determined that disclosure of CBI to Weston is necessary in order that they may carry out the work required
by that contract with EPA. The contract complies with all requirements of 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2)(ii), incorporated by
reference into 40 CFR 2.310(h)(2). EPA Region 9 will require that each Weston employee sign a written agreement that
he or she: (1) will use the information only for the purpose of carrying out the work required by the contract, (2) shall
refrain from disclosing the information to anyone other than EPA without the prior written approval of each affected
business or of an EPA legal office, and (3) shall return to EPA all copies of the information (and any abstracts or extracts
therefrom) upon request from the EPA program office, whenever the information is no longer required by Weston for
performance of the work required by the contract. These non-disclosure statements shall be maintained on file with
the Project Officer. Weston employees will be trained on Superfund CBI requirements.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid
waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply
with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribe Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency has been approving and intends to continue approving adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit
programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR.
Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements.
In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes
that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between
State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located
in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the
extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status
of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and
unpermitted MSWLF facilities.

The State of New Jersey applied for a partial determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed New
Jersey's application and certain amendments and revisions thereto, and made a tentative determination that all
portions of New Jersey's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria,
except for Subpart E relating to Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action. New Jersey plans to revise the remainder
of its permit program to assure complete compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria and gain full program approval.
New Jersey's application for partial program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has scheduled an opportunity for a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details appear below

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine
that State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs are adequate to comply with the revised Federal Criteria.
To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to propose in STIR to allow partial approvals if: (1) The Regional Administrator determines that the State/Tribal
permit program largely meets the requirements for ensuring compliance with part 258; (2) changes limited to a narrow
part(s) of the State/Tribal permit program are needed to meet these requirements; and (3) provisions not included
in the partially approved portions of the State/Tribal permit program are a clearly identifiable and a separable
subset of part 258. These requirements, if promulgated, will address the potential problems posed by the dual State/Tribal
and Federal programs that came into effect in October 1993 in those States/Tribes that only have partial approvals
of their MSWLF programs. On that date, Federal rules covering any portion of a State/Tribe's program that had not received
EPA approval became enforceable. Owners and operators of MSWLFs subject to such dual programs must be able to understand
which requirements apply and comply with them. In addition, the pieces of the Federal program that are in effect must
mesh well enough with the approved portions of the State/Tribal program to leave no significant gaps in regulatory
control of MSWLF's. Partial approval will allow the Agency to approve those provisions of the State/Tribal permit
program that meet the requirements and provide the State/Tribe time to make necessary changes to the remaining portions
of its program. As a result, owners/operators will be able to work with the State/Tribal permitting agency to take
advantage of the Criteria's flexibility for those portions of the program which have been approved.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As provided in the October 9, 1991 municipal landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October
9, 1993. Consequently, any remaining portions of the Federal Criteria that are not included in an approved State/Tribal
program apply directly to the owner/operator without the flexibility that would be present in an approved State/Tribal
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has been approving and intends to continue approving State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation
of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other
forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards
for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe
must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction.
The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section
7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring
and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved
MSWLF program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. Various components of authority and capability were submitted by
New Jersey in its application for partial program approval, and the revisions and amendments thereto. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also is requesting States/Tribes seeking partial program approval to provide a schedule for the submittal of
all remaining portions of their MSWLF permit programs. EPA notes that it intends to propose to make submission of a
schedule mandatory in STIR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not all States/Tribes will have existing permit programs through which they can ensure compliance with all provisions
of the revised Federal Criteria. Were EPA to restrict a State/Tribe from submitting its application until it could
ensure compliance with the entirety of 40 CFR part 258, many States/Tribes would need to postpone obtaining approval
of their permit programs for a significant amount of time. This delay in determining the adequacy of the State/Tribal
permit program while the State/Tribe revises its statutes or regulations could impose a substantial burden on owners
and operators of landfills because the State/Tribe would be unable to exercise the flexibility available to States/Tribes
with permit programs which have been approved as adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a State's/Tribe's regulations and statutes are amended to comply with the federal MSWLF landfill regulations,
unapproved portions of a partially approved MSWLF permit program may be approved by the EPA. The State/Tribe may submit
an amended application to EPA for review and an adequacy determination will be made using the same criteria as for the
initial application. This adequacy determination will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 summarizing the Agency's decision and the portion(s) of the State/Tribal MSWLF permit program affected and providing
an opportunity to comment for a period of 30 days. The adequacy determination will become effective sixty (60) days
following publication if no adverse comments are received. If EPA receives adverse comments on its adequacy determination,
another 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

B. State of New Jersey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1994, the State of New Jersey submitted an application for partial determination of adequacy of its solid
waste landfill permit program. Certain revisions and amendments were submitted on July 21, 1994 and September 6,
1994. The application addressed all components of 40 CFR part 258 and discussed New Jersey's enforcement authority,
provisions for citizen participation, and the current status of the universe of landfills within the State. EPA reviewed
New Jersey's application and tentatively determined that the State's program meets all requirements necessary
to qualify for a determination of partial approval of adequacy to ensure compliance with the Federal Criteria with
the exception of Subpart E_Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action. Upon appropriate adoption of revisions
to its existing ground-water regulations, it is expected that New Jersey will become eligible for full approval which
will include subpart E. On September 6, 1994, New Jersey provided a schedule as called for in its application, which
indicates that all proposed regulatory revisions are expected to be adopted by October, 1995, at which time the revised
regulations will be fully effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has the responsibility for implementing and enforcing solid
waste management regulations, including a permit program, inspection authority and enforcement activities. The
State has determined that at present, 12 regional and 2 municipal sanitary landfills are subject to all components
of the Federal Criteria. Twenty-two other existing sole source landfills as well as those landfills that closed prior
to the effective date of the Federal Criteria, while not subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 258, are still subject
to the laws and regulations of the State of New Jersey, including those pertaining to closed and unpermitted landfills.
New Jersey has identified a significant number of such sites, which may be classified as ``open dumps'' pursuant to
40 CFR part 257 and which are subject to regulation and enforcement by New Jersey under existing state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure compliance with all of the revised Federal Criteria, New Jersey needs to revise existing regulations concerning
groundwater monitoring and corrective action so that the revised regulations are aligned with part 258, subpart
E. As noted previously, New Jersey has submitted a schedule indicating that such regulatory revisions will be effective
by October, 1995. To allow Jersey to begin exercising some of the flexibility allowed in States/Tribes with adequate
permit programs, EPA is proposing to approve those portions of New Jersey's program that are ready for action today.
These include criteria for location, operation, closure and post-closure care, and financial assurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until December 14, 1994. Copies of New Jersey's
application including revisions and amendments are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated
in the

The EPA will hold a public hearing on its tentative decision. The hearing will be held on December 14, 1994 at the Public
Hearing Room, NJDEP, 401 E. State St, Trenton, NJ. Comments can be submitted orally at the hearing or in writing at the
time of the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during the public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for New
Jersey's program. EPA expects to make a final determination by January 27, 1995 and will give notice of it in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and responses to all major comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA will be considered to be in compliance with Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this notice is to announce the extension of the comment period for the ``Contaminated Sediment Management
Strategy'' (OW&hyph;FRL&hyph;5062&hyph;2) for 30 days. The comment period will close on November 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original notice, announcing the availability of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy, was published
on August 30, 1994, and the public comment period closed on October 31, 1994. Because the proposed Strategy is a unique
plan of action developed to address a significant national environmental problem, and to streamline decision-making
within and among EPA programs, the Agency is requesting comments on the Strategy. EPA is extending the public comment
period because the Agency has received requests to extend the comment period to ensure an adequate and thorough review
of the Strategy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA announced the availability of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy in the August 30, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (OW&hyph;FRL&hyph;5062&hyph;2). Contaminated sediment poses ecological and human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health risks in many watersheds throughout the United States. In these watersheds, sediment serves as a contaminant
reservoir from which fish and bottom dwelling organisms can accumulate toxic compounds and pass them up the food chain.
EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy was developed to streamline decision-making within
and among the Agency's program offices by promoting and ensuring: the use of consistent sediment assessment practices,
consistent consideration of risks posed by contaminated sediment, the use of consistent approaches to management
of contaminated sediment risks, and the wise use of scarce resources for research and technology development.

 notice. Readers are referred to that notice for additional details. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has received requests to extend the public comment period to ensure an adequate and thorough review of the
Strategy. Therefore, the comment period is extended from October 31, 1994, for 30 days, to November 30, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),
announces the opportunity for potential collaborators to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement
(CRADA) to develop a system or systems to automate sampling method development and analysis for airborne contaminants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is anticipated that all inventions which may arise from this CRADA will be jointly owned. The collaborator(s) with
whom the CRADA is made will have an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive royalty-bearing license. The
CRADA will be executed for a 2-year period with the possibility of renewal for another 2-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because CRADAs are designed to facilitate the development of scientific and technological knowledge into useful,
marketable products, a great deal of freedom is given to Federal agencies in implementing collaborative research.
The CDC may accept staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money from the other participants in a CRADA; CDC may
provide staff, facilities, equipment, and supplies to the project. There is a single restriction in this exchange:
CDC MAY NOT PROVIDE FUNDS to the other participants in a CRADA. This opportunity is available until 30 days after publication
of this notice. Respondents may be provided a longer period of time to furnish additional information if CDC finds
this necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) requires drug sponsors to submit new drug applications
(NDA's) to FDA for review and approval before marketing in the United States. FDA's review processes culminate in
a risk-benefit assessment and regulatory decision. To arrive at a substantive risk-benefit assessment and confident
regulatory decision, the agency must evaluate all information and data provided via the application supporting
safety, efficacy, and/or other claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has been assessing the use of automation technology to support and assist in premarketing review processes
and has found that technology holds the potential for enhancing review process quality and efficiencies. Consequently,
the agency supports the use of electronic submissions by the pharmaceutical industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 9, 1992 (57 FR 46565), FDA published a notice announcing that the draft guidance manual for CANDA's was available
in hard copy and electronically. The guidance manual provides general guidance to assist the pharmaceutical industry
in preparing and submitting CANDA's that are effective and capable of being evaluated. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 8, 1993 (59 FR 18218), the agency published a notice announcing the procedures for revising the draft guidance
manual, and that the revised guidance manual would be available electronically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that an accompanying paper submission of the application remains a requirement at this time. The electronic
version should correspond exactly to the paper version; where it does not, the differences are to be specified. Currently,
assessment of electronic submissions versus paper submissions is underway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``CANDA Guidance Manual'' discusses procedures of general applicability that are acceptable to the agency,
but are not legal requirements. The ``CANDA Guidance Manual'' does not bind the agency, nor does it create or confer
any rights, privileges, benefits, or obligations for or on any person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency will distribute copies free of charge since the electronic submission program is evolving and the manual
provides recommended interim guidance and procedures, and does not mandate electronic submission specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An electronic version of the guidance manual is available via Internet. Requestors should connect to the CDER FTP
server using the FTP protocol. The manual and updates are available in the sub-directory ``CANDA'' in both WordPerfect
Version 5.2 and an ASCII version. Individual chapters are also available. The file READ.ME in the CANDA sub-directory
lists the file names of the WordPerfect and ASCII versions of the entire document and each chapter.

 Since its creation, the Community Development Work Study Program has been administered by the Assistant Secretary
for Community Planning and Development. However, on September 6, 1994, the program was transferred to the Office
of University Partnerships under the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. This newly created
Office will administer HUD's ongoing grant programs to institutions of higher education as well as create initiatives
through which colleges and universities can bring their traditional missions of teaching, research, service, and
outreach to bear on the pressing local problems in their communities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In cooperation with the California Department of Fish &amp; Game, and under authority of 43 CFR 8364.1, the Clear Lake
Resource Area of the Bureau of Land Management is designating emergency vehicular closures on three parcels of recently-acquired
public lands. These parcels are known as the Leal, Kerwin, and Johnson acquisitions. All vehicular use except for
that associated with administrative access, emergencies, and valid existing rights (mining claims, pre-existing
public access, rights-of-ways/easements, etc.) will be prohibited year-round. These closures are consistent
with the Clear Lake Resource Area Management Framework Plan (MFP) Update, as well as the Cache Creek Area of Critical
Environmental Concern (ACEC) Management Plan and the Cache Creek Tule Elk Habitat Management Plan (HMP). These closures
will be in effect until the Cache Creek Coordinated Resource Management Plan (CRMP) is completed, at which time a final
determination will be made to rescind, modify, or continue with the closures as is. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These three closures are included within the Cache Creek Management Area, a unit managed primarily for wildlife and
primitive recreational values. Detailed maps of these three areas are available upon request from the Clear Lake
Resource Area office of the BLM in Ukiah, California.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Leal acquisition includes 1,475.92 acres acquired by the BLM in October 1993. These lands are located in portions
of Sections 28, 29, 32, 33, and 34 of T. 14N., R. 5W., MDM, and Sections 3 and 4 of T 13N., R. 5W, MDM. along the Lake and Colusa
county line. Prior to acquisition by the BLM, there was no public access on or through this property. These lands were
acquired primarily for wildlife and primitive recreational values. The habitats here support tule elk, blacktail
deer, wild turkey, feral pig, mountain lion, and many other species. Some key habitat improvements have been completed
and others will be implemented in the near future. These projects will further improve this area for the tule elk and
many of the other species found here. In the absence of a closure, unrestricted public vehicular use here would negate
the success and intended purpose of these projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Kerwin acquisition includes 948.72 acres acquired in January 1994. These lands are located in portions of Sections
30 and 31 of T. 14N., R. 5W., MDM (referred to as the Northern Unit), and all of Section 36 of T. 14N, R. 6W., MDM. (referred
to as the Southern Unit), all in Lake County and bisected by State Highway 20. Prior to acquisition by the BLM, an easement
granted to Lake County for public vehicular access across private lands (in the Northern Unit) was in existence along
the Walker Ridge Road, beginning at the turnoff from State Highway 20 and continuing for approximately one mile northwest
to the beginning of public lands. The Southern Unit had no previous public access available. The Kerwin property was
acquired for wildlife habitat, rare plants, and primitive recreational values. The acquired lands along the first
mile of the Walker Ridge Road (in the Northern Unit) pass through open oak-grassland and meadow habitats supporting
known populations of special status plant species. Currently vehicular access off the first mile of the Walker Ridge
Road is unrestricted for the most part, due to the open nature of the habitat. This use has resulted in documented damage
to the special status plants found here. In the Southern Unit year-round use by the tule elk has been documented. Unrestricted
vehicular use by adjacent landowners has resulted in disturbance to the elk herd, special status plants, and to soils.
Without a closure, unrestricted public vehicular use would result in further disturbance and damage to resource
values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Johnson acquisition includes 2,032.06 acres acquired in January 1994. These lands are located in portions of
Sections 8, 9, 16, 17, 21, and 28 of T. 12N., R. 4W. MDM, all in Yolo County. Prior to acquisition an easement for public
vehicular access through 3.2 miles of this property existed on Yolo County Road 40. This access was limited to Road
40 only and did not allow for any use off the road. Because this property is now public land, there are no restrictions
in place to prohibit vehicular use off the road. Much of the habitat found here is open oak-grassland and is easily accessed
from Road 40. Soils here are fragile and easily damaged by vehicle use. This property was acquired primarily for wildlife
values (including endangered species habitat) and non-motorized recreational use. In the absence of a closure,
unrestricted public vehicular use here would result in serious soils damage in the sensitive oak-grassland habitats.

Title to the non-Federal lands was accepted on July 19, 1994. The value of the Federal lands exceeded the value of the
non-Federal lands by $1,612,500.00. An equalization payment in that amount was made to the United States by Olympic
Land Corporation. The purpose of the exchange was for the United States to acquire non-Federal lands with high value
for recreation and riparian habitat.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Cavalear Companies (Applicant), is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service),
pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. The permit would authorize
the take of the Florida scrub jay, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 a threatened species, in Brevard County, Florida, for a period of 5 years. The proposed taking is incidental to construction
of 266 single family homes including the necessary infrastructure on approximately 104 acres (Project), 12 acres
of which is occupied Florida scrub jay habitat to be permanently altered. The Project is called The Cloisters, and
is located along State Road A1A, south of the Terrace Shores subdivision, in the south beaches area of Brevard County,
Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing
the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment
within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no
sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National
Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated
population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida,
it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that one Florida scrub jay family currently uses the suitable
habitat within the Project. The Applicant proposes to impact this territory by removing constituent life support
elements. Initial construction of roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore
result in death of, or injury to, scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat
alteration associated with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the loss of 12 acres of scrub jay habitat and accompanying scrub jay family,
the Applicant will purchase 24 acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County,
and provide a management endowment of $24,000.00 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed
by the Applicant include protection of active nests, if discovered, during the nesting season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and
no action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fieldstone/La Costa Associates and the City of Carlsbad have applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service),
Department of the Interior, for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The application has been assigned permit No. PRT&hyph;795759. The application includes
a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for a proposed 1,940 acre project (HCP area) in the southeastern corner of the City
of Carlsbad, San Diego County, California. Completion of the grading and construction activities associated with
the proposed project would result in direct impacts on-site to 30 of 48 known pairs of the threatened coastal California
gnatcatcher (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Polioptila californica californica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) (gnatcatcher), 507 of 944 acres of coastal sage scrub, 91 of 120 acres of southern maritime chaparral, 158 of 195 acres
of southern mixed chaparral, 254 of 307 acres of grassland, and 69 of 114 acres of riparian scrub/woodland. Approximately
18 pairs of gnatcatchers, 437 acres of coastal sage scrub, and 193 acres of associated habitats on-site will be conserved
and managed in perpetuity. In addition, 240 acres of off-site mitigation is proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicants have requested the issuance of permits (immediately or when a species is listed) under section 10(a)
of the Act that would authorize incidental take, in accordance with the terms of the HCP, of the 66 sensitive species
listed in the HCP. Of these species, the coastal California gnatcatcher is the only one that is listed as threatened
or endangered under the Act and is the only federally listed species observed on-site. In a number of cases, the species
named in the HCP have not been observed on-site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice advises the public of the availability of a draft Environmental Assessment (EA), HCP, and an Addendum
to the HCP. These documents were prepared by the applicants and their consultants. This notice is provided pursuant
to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations (40 CFR 1506.6(b)). The Service
will evaluate the application, associated documents, and comments submitted thereon to determine whether the application
meets the requirements of NEPA regulations and section 10(a) of the Act. If it is determined that the requirements
are met, a permit will be issued for the incidental take of listed species identified in the application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 9 of the Act, and implementing regulations, taking of federally listed threatened or endangered species
is prohibited. Taking, in part, is defined as harm or harassment of federally listed species, including under certain
circumstances, the destruction of habitat. Under limited circumstances, the Service may issue section 10(a)(1)(B)
permits to take listed animal species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities.
Regulations governing permits for listed species are found at Title 50 Code of Federal Regulations 17.22 and 17.32.

Fieldstone/La Costa Associates and the City of Carlsbad have applied for a 30-year permit to authorize incidental
take associated with a proposed residential development and re-alignment of Rancho Santa Fe Road in the HCP area.
The HCP area contains two geographic subareas: a 1,278 acre subarea identified as ``Rancheros-Southeast II'' and
a 662 acre subarea identified as ``Northwest,'' both occurring within the area covered by Carlsbad's citywide Habitat
Management Plan (HMP), a subarea plan under the statewide Natural Communities Conservation Program (NCCP). The
HCP area also is located within the jurisdiction of the Multiple Habitat Conservation Plan (MHCP), a subregional
plan addressing north coastal San Diego County under the NCCP. A concern has been raised regarding the consistency
of the HCP with the HMP and MHCP under the NCCP.

The HCP details project actions that may result in take of the gnatcatcher and 65 additional species proposed by the
applicant to be included in an Implementation Agreement (in preparation), and specific actions that will mitigate
such takings. Mitigation measures include dedication of the proposed on and off-site preserve areas to a ``conservation
entity'' approved by the Service, and long-term funding, management and monitoring. Other sensitive species that
occur on-site and are proposed to be included in the Implementation Agreement are the federally proposed endangered

The major alternatives under consideration during planning include: 1) no take of listed species; 2) no take of gnatcatchers;
3) take only within the Rancho Santa Fe Road project area; 4) delay of take pending completion of the HMP; 5) an off-site
mitigation strategy with unlimited take in the plan area; 6) reconfiguration of the proposed on-site conserved habitat;
7) no action; and 8) the applicants' proposal. Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 were considered financially infeasible
by the applicants. Alternative 5 was considered biologically unacceptable by the Service. Alternative 8 is still
under discussion.

Environmental and Energy Considerations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. No new regulatory requirements are imposed, directly or indirectly, on
such entities. The economic impact on small entities, if any, is not likely to be significant within the meaning of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission accepts for consideration the application filed September 30, 1994, by Canadian Pacific Limited,
Canadian Pacific (U.S.) Holdings Inc., Soo Line Corporation, and Soo Line Railroad Company (Soo) (collectively,
applicants). Soo and Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) own the Davenport, Rock Island and North Western
Railway Company (DRI) jointly. Soo seeks to acquire sole control of DRI as a prelude to merging DRI into Soo. DRI lines
east of the Mississippi River will be transferred to BN, and lines west of the Mississippi River (and BN's ownership
interest in a joint BN/Soo line) will be transferred to Soo. Soo's East Moline-Albany line (east of the Mississippi
River) will also be transferred to BN. DRI will cease to exist. Under 49 CFR part 1180, the Commission finds this to be
a minor transaction.

the issuance of any new securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 BN and Soo expect to benefit from administrative cost savings associated with eliminating DRI as a separate entity.
Applicants aver that the allocation of DRI's lines between BN and Soo reflect, in part, their operational patterns
in the Quad Cities area. They have concluded that it would be more efficient for each carrier to handle its own traffic
on the DRI lines with a contractual allocation of the cost of maintenance of the lines. Transfer of the DRI lines, they
say, will permit the efficient consolidation of former DRI switching operations with the existing operations of
BN and Soo in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 With the elimination of DRI, Soo and BN plan to establish a direct interchange in the Quad Cities area. Industries currently
switched by DRI for BN or Soo will now be served directly by those carriers. Applicants note that no shipper or industry
will lose rail service or experience any reduction in rail transportation options as a result of these transactions,
and shippers on the East Moline-Albany line currently served by one railroad will be served by two railroads. Applicants
anticipate no discontinuances or abandonments in connection with or as a result of the proposed transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Applicants contend that the transactions will not adversely impact BN or Soo employees; however, DRI's current 25-man
workforce will be abolished before or upon consummation of the proposed transactions. On July 20, 1994, DRI offered
a voluntary severance package to employees with 10 or more years of service. Management employees received a separate
severance package. Applicants recognize that, for each transaction for which approval is sought, the appropriate
level of labor protection is that set forth in

 Under 49 CFR 1180.4(b)(2)(iv), we must determine whether a proposed transaction is major, significant, minor or
exempt. The proposal here does not involve the control or merger of two or more class I railroads and has no regional
or national significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A review of the expected result of the transactions subject to this application, and the related exemptions, confirms
the minor nature of these transactions. Upon consummation BN will own and operate DRI's rail line between Davenport,
IA and East Moline, IL, over which BN and Soo already operate and over which Soo will continue to operate pursuant to
BN's grant back of trackage rights. BN will own and operate Soo's rail line between East Moline and Albany, IL, over
which Soo will also continue to operate pursuant to BN's grant back of trackage rights. Soo will own and operate the
joint BN/Soo line at Clinton, IA and the DRI line between Davenport and Clinton. Soo and BN already operate over both
lines, and BN will continue to operate over both lines pursuant to Soo's grant back of trackage rights.

Pioneer Railcorp (Pioneer), a noncarrier holding company, has filed a notice of exemption to acquire control, through
stock purchase, of Vandalia Railroad Company, a class III rail carrier that leases and operates a former Illinois
Central Gulf Railroad line, between milepost 689.83 and milepost 692.54, a distance of 2.71 miles, in Vandalia, Fayette

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Pioneer owns and controls six other nonconnecting class III rail carriers: West Jersey Railroad Co., operating in

Central Railroad Co. (formerly Natchez Trace Railroad), operating in Mississippi and Tennessee; Alabama &amp;

Pioneer states that: (1) the properties operated by these carriers do not connect each other; (2) the continuance
in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or
any other railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction
therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civil Action No. 94&hyph;0443&hyph;N&hyph;HLR was lodged with the United States District Court for the District
of Idaho. The complaint, filed on October 4, 1994, alleges that defendants Pacific Mechanical Insulators, Inc.,
Pacific Technologies, Inc., Olshan Asbestos Removal Corp. (``Olshan''), and Potlatch Corporation (``Potlatch'')
violated the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for asbestos, 40 CFR part 61, subpart M, and
Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. S 7412 during a 1989&hyph;1990 renovation of the Potlatch pulp and paper
plant in Lewiston, Idaho. The consent decrees resolve the United States' claims only against Potlatch and Olshan
and has no effect on the claims against the remaining defendants. Pursuant to the proposed consent decrees, Olshan
and Potlatch will pay civil penalties of $353,800 and $250,000 respectively and Potlach will implement a company-wide
asbestos control program.

General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, for Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;3 issued to the Toledo Edison
Company, Centerior Service Company, and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (the licensees), for operation
of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1, located in Ottawa County, Ohio.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption would relieve the licensee from the requirement of conducting a full pressure airlock leakage
test, pursuant to section III.D.2(b)(ii) of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, whenever airlocks are opened during periods
when containment integrity is not required and no maintenance has been performed on the airlock that affects its sealing
capabilities. The licensee would rely instead, on the seal leakage test described in section III.D.2(b)(iii), when
the reactor is in cold shutdown (MODE 5) or refueling (MODE 6) and when no maintenance has been performed on the airlock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee's request for exemption and the bases therefor are contained in a letter dated October 21, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption is from performance of the leakage rate test required by paragraph III.D.2(b)(ii) of 10 CFR
part 50, appendix J, which requires at least 12 hours per airlock to perform. Exemption from full pressure leakage
tests on airlocks opened during a period when containment integrity is not required would provide the licensee with
greater plant availability over the lifetime of the plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption would permit the substitution of an airlock seal leakage test (section III.D.2(b)(iii) of
appendix J of 10 CFR part 50) for the full pressure airlock test, otherwise required by section III.D.2(b)(ii) when
the airlock is opened, while the reactor is in cold shutdown or refueling mode. If the tests required by section III.D.2(b)
(i) and (iii) are current, and no maintenance performed on the airlock, then there will be adequate assurance of continued
leak tight integrity of the airlock, and this exemption will not affect containment integrity, and does not affect
the risk of facility accidents. Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not be greater than previously determined,
nor does the proposed exemption otherwise affect radiological plant effluents, nor result in any significant occupational
exposure. Likewise, the exemption does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmental
impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or non-radiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because it has been concluded that there is no significant impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternative
to the exemption will have either no environmental impact or greater environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. Such action would not reduce environmental impacts
of Davis-Besse, Unit No. 1 operations and would result in reduced operational flexibility or unwarranted delays
in power ascension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with the ``Final Environmental
Statement Related to Operation of Davis-Besse, Unit No. 1,'' dated October 1975.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the Ohio State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The
state official had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's request for exemption dated October 21,
1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street NW., Washington,
DC, and the University of Toledo Library, Documents Department, 2801 Bancroft Avenue, Toledo, Ohio 03606.

Customer Service Plan of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to Executive Order 12862 issued as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vice President's National Performance Review, the Securities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exchange Commission (SEC) developed a customer service plan. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal of the plan is to enhance investor protection through an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved investor education effort and a redirection of resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to augment the SEC's responsiveness to investor concerns and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints. The plan submitted to the Vice President on September 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8, 1994 was modified slightly on October 24, 1994. The modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SEC is responsible for protecting investors through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement of the federal securities laws and oversight and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation of the securities markets. Individual and institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors have trillions of dollars invested in securities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mutual funds in the United States and abroad. While the SEC does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not approve or guarantee any investments, it is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring that securities issuers provide full disclosure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material information to investors and that markets adhere to fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investors deal directly with the SEC through its Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Affairs, which is responsible for processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding to inquiries and complaint letters from the public. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal 1993, the SEC received over 34,700 investor complaints and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquiries. Although the SEC has no authority to provide legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation to investors, the SEC may request information from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brokerage firms and securities exchanges regarding particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems. The SEC obtains invaluable leads from investors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 18% of investigations each year have resulted, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least in part, from investor complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general public also deals directly with the SEC through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its Public Reference Rooms located in Washington, D.C., New York 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
City, and Chicago. These facilities maintain a library of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporate filings, Commission releases, and other documents for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use by the public. The SEC staff provide assistance to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in locating and obtaining information and in using the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic filing system, known as EDGAR. In fiscal 1993, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities had nearly 45,000 visitors requesting nearly 63,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents and microfiche, and over 121,000 telephone inquiries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its role of supervising the public securities markets, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SEC processes and reviews the filings of more than 13,000 entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are required to file prospectuses, annual and quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, proxy statements and other informational documents. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also acts on the rule filings of the various stock exchanges and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-regulatory organizations. Efficiency is paramount for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-sensitive filings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of its diverse customer base and the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its work to investors and the financial markets, efficient and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective customer service is a top priority at the SEC. The SEC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has undertaken several initiatives to improve its ``user- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
friendliness'' and to educate investors.

&bull;In November 1993, the SEC conducted a voluntary telephone consumer survey of up to 1,000 households to obtain
background information regarding the public's understanding of the risks involved with purchasing mutual funds
sold through banks. The survey found that 28% of those surveyed believed that all mutual funds sold through banks are
insured, and of people who have bought funds through banks, 66% believed that money market mutual funds are federally
insured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Between January and March 1994, the SEC arranged four focus groups of 10 to 20 investors each to obtain more detailed
information from individual investors of mutual funds. The first two groups addressed the SEC's concern that consumers
do not adequately understand the risks involved with investing in mutual funds sold through banks. The other two sessions
provided the SEC insight on investor's understanding of mutual fund prospectuses and the information they derive
from the prospectuses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Invest Wisely,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which provides basic information to help investors select a brokerage firm and salesperson, identify decisions
to be made before making an initial investment decision and address a problem that may arise. This brochure also helps
investors identify questions they should ask, provides background information about the securities industry,
and describes practices that may signal a problem.

Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;On March 10, 1994, Chairman Levitt announced the creation of the Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee. The
purpose of this committee is to open a channel through which the SEC can receive advice and information to help it better
address the needs of investors in their role as consumers of financial products and services. Made up of members with
diverse backgrounds and expertise, the committee will continue to explore broad, fundamental issues of concern
to investors, especially disclosure and communication of information from corporations, brokerage firms, investment
companies and investment advisers to their investors/clients. The committee also will address regulatory simplification
and examine how the SEC can be more responsive to consumer needs and effective in helping to resolve consumer problems.

Streamline Action on Rule Filings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Since taking office in July 1993, Chairman Levitt has taken significant steps to virtually eliminate the backlog
of overdue rule filings by the stock exchanges and the self-regulatory organizations (SRO). The Commission has proposed
rule amendments that would increase the number of SRO rule filings that may become effective immediately, and instituted
procedures to ensure that the Commission will take final action on other filings within a six-month period.

Reorganize the SEC's Enforcement Efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The SEC's ability to hunt down securities violations has been enhanced by placing all regional SEC offices
under the supervision of the Enforcement Division and relocating certain operations. This has streamlined the organization
and provided more efficient allocation of resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SEC plans to take further action this fall regarding education of investors and improvement of customer service,
including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The SEC will publish and distribute a second brochure, entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Invest Wisely: Mutual Funds, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to provide investors with basic information on mutual funds. The SEC plans to create a series of brochures to help investors
become better educated consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The SEC will conduct additional surveys and focus groups to develop other meaningful and useful solutions
for better education of investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The SEC will disseminate information to investors via an electronic bulletin board on Internet. Such information
will include Investor Alerts, descriptions of new or emerging types of securities fraud; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information for Investors, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
articles on a variety of specific topics; and SEC publications that presently are available only in hardcopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The SEC will establish a toll-free consumer hotline to provide investors and the general public with useful
information regarding common consumer inquiries. The topics will include how to file investor complaints; what
the SEC can and cannot do for investors; how to obtain information from public companies, brokerage firms and other
investment representatives; and how to order certain publications from the SEC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The SEC will install a new and improved Information Line in the headquarters Public Reference Room to provide
callers with access to general information about the SEC, a means to request facsimiles of the recorded general information
and the ability to transfer within the SEC to specific offices for detailed information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The SEC is providing enhanced training to its consumer affairs specialists at headquarters and in the field
offices. A special review of the consumer affairs function is underway and several recommendations have been implemented
to improve the agency's responsiveness to consumers.

Letter from Ivonne L. Nagy, Special Counsel, Legal &amp; Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Peter Geraghty, Senior
Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (October 19, 1994). In the future, the Amex intends to file under
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act a proposed rule change to permit it to use the New York Stock Exchange's Overnight Comparison
System for the Amex equities transactions.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms and Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Amex to begin using the New York Stock Exchange's Overnight
Comparison System (``OCS'') for all bond transactions executed at the Amex on and after October 21, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C)
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 21, 1994, the Amex will commence use of the New York Stock Exchange's OCS for the comparison of all Amex bond
transactions executed at the Amex. Transactions in Amex equities and options will continue to be compared and processed
through the Amex's Intra-Day Comparison System (``IDC'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change from IDC to OCS for the comparison of all Amex bond transactions will have no impact on the efficiency and
capacity of the electronic system. OCS will continue to deliver an automated, highly flexible, and efficient system
for capturing, comparing, and processing bond trades as well as providing a greater measure of uniformity between
the Amex and New York Stock Exchange marketplaces. Essentially, the same procedures presently in use for IDC will
continue to apply to OCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the proposed rule change consists of amendments to Amex Rules 700(e),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 719(b),
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>
 729,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and 731
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and the rescission of Amex Rule 731A
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 to require Amex members on and after October 21, 1994, to submit initial trade data for transactions in listed bonds
effected on the Amex through OCS for comparison. The proposal also will enable Amex members to resolve through OCS
all uncompared transactions in listed bonds effected on the Amex for ``Regular Way,'' ``Next Day,'' and ``Seller
Option'' settlement that are traded on an ``issued,'' ``when listed,'' and ``when distributed'' basis. Uncompared
transactions that cannot be resolved on T+1 will be subject to close out. However, if a transaction remains in the system
and both parties agree to the trade it will compare on T+2. In addition, OCS also will compare ``Ex-Clearing House''
bond transactions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
any transaction in which the buying and selling parties to the trade agree to physically settle the transaction between
themselves) for ``Cash,'' ``Next-Day,'' and ``Seller's Option'' settlement.

The Amex will accept initial trade data submissions in all listed bonds traded on the floor of the Amex from its clearing
member organizations and compare the data through OCS. The compared trades then will be transmitted to the National
Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') where the transactions will be printed on clearing members' contract
sheets. NSCC then will complete the clearance and settlement process. Any uncompared trade will remain in OCS for
resolution until resolved or canceled.

Cancel means to remove the transaction from the system. When there is an uncompared transaction and one party does
not acknowledge the transaction, the floor official can authorize the close out of the transaction. However, where
the transaction is acknowledged by both parties but one party does not acknowledge the transaction until T+2, the
transaction must be canceled by the late acknowledging party and must be resubmitted as an ``as of'' trade.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Expanding the Amex's on-line comparison system to include bond transactions will automate the Exchange's bond trade
comparison and resolution system and will shorten the comparison cycle from T+2 to T+1. The Amex believes the proposal
will reduce the risk exposure to investors and to Amex members and will contribute to the prompt and efficient clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. The Amex also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with
Section 6(b) of the Act and specifically with the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in that it will foster cooperation
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect
to, and facilitating transactions in securities and will protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires that the rules of the Exchange be designed to foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in securities and protect investors and the public interest. The Commission finds that the proposed
rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) in that it will expand Amex's on-line comparison system to include
bond transactions and will automate Amex's bond trade resolution system. In addition, the proposal will shorten
the comparison cycle for bond transactions from T+2 to T+1, which is consistent with the conversion to a three business
day settlement cycle.

Amex has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because it will allow Amex members to begin utilizing the New York Stock Exchange's OCS for bond transactions
as soon as possible. In addition, Amex has distributed two information circulars to its members concerning the use
of the New York Stock Exchange's OCS for bond transactions, and Amex has not received any comments. Further, the Commission
published for comment the New York Stock Exchange's proposal to implement OCS, received no comments, and subsequently
approved the proposal.

On June 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to increase from 10 to 100 the firm quote contract size minimum applicable to Designated Primary
Market Makers (``DPMs'') in classes of interest rate options for which Public Automated Routing System (``PAR'')
workstations are available. On June 17, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for comment in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 1, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change
on September 22, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 This order approves the proposal, as amended.

In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE states that the reference to ``public customer orders'' in its proposal is synonymous
with, and should be understood to mean, ``non-broker-dealer customer orders.'' In addition, Amendment No. 1 states
that the phrase ``public customer'' in Exhibit A to the CBOE's filing should read ``non-broker-dealer customer,''
thereby making the phraseology consistent with the language used in CBOE Rule 8.51.

In Amendment No. 2, the CBOE revises its proposed Regulatory Circular to clarify that it is the introduction of the
PAR workstation in combination with the existing Autoquote System that enables a DPM to revise automatically his
market in 100 lot sizes without undue risk. Thus, the revised proposed Regulatory Circular introduces an explicit
reference to the CBOE's Autoquote System.

 letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite, to Fancois Mazur, Attorney Division of Market Regulation,
Commission, dated September 22, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). In addition, Amendment No. 2 states that currently there
are seven PAR workstations installed at the CBOE: one assigned to the DPM at the post where 30-year bond interest rate
options are traded; and six assigned to floor brokers at various posts. No additional DPMs currently are scheduled
to receive PAR workstations.

II. Description of Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE proposes to require DPMs using PAR workstations to provide firm quotes of up to 100 contracts on interest rate
options for non-broker-dealer customer orders. This quote size minimum is substantially higher than the 10 contract
minimum otherwise applicable to DPMs under CBOE Rule 8.51 and prior Regulatory Circulars.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The 100 contract minimum will be operative initially only in 30-year bond interest rate options, since this is the
first class for which a PAR workstation will be assigned. The Exchange expects that the 100-contract minimum will
be extended gradually to other classes of interest rate options, as the use of PAR workstations expands to these classes.
The CBOE will issue a Regulatory Circular describing the details of its proposal.

The applicability of CBOE Rule 8.51 to DPMs is provided for in Regulatory Circular 93&hyph;31 (May 7, 1993). Prior
to the issuance of Regulatory Circular 93&hyph;31, the CBOE required DPMs to assure that each disseminated market
quotation in all expiration months for all appointed option classes be honored up to five contracts, both for broker-dealer
and non-broker-dealer customer orders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 CBOE Rule 8.80(c)(2). Pursuant to Regulatory Circular 93&hyph;31, DPMs became obligated to ensure that the disseminated
market quotation be firm for the two near-term expiration series for up to ten contracts for non-broker-dealer customer
orders only.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

crowds adopted in July 1989 in the floor-wide firm quote rule.

The Exchange believes that this change in DPM quote commitment levels will enhance the depth and liquidity of its markets
in interest rate options. Currently, much of the trading in interest rate derivatives is done in markets where quoted
or negotiated prices can be obtained in transaction sizes larger than is guaranteed at the CBOE. The Exchange believes
that increasing the firm quote size minimum should enable it to compete more effectively for order flow and trading
activity in interest rate options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange also believes that the DPMs affected by the rule change will be able to meet the higher commitment levels
without incurring undue financial risk because of the inherent efficiencies of the PAR workstations combined with
the efficiencies already existing with respect to the Exchange's Autoquote System.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 A PAR workstation is a newly-developed, automated, computer-based workstation that provides users with the ability
to execute trades, transmit trade reports, and enter other data and commands at the touch of a screen, thereby eliminating
the delay inherent in a keyboard-based system. The Exchange's Autoquote System enables DPMs to change their published
quotes almost instantaneously in response to changed market conditions, which in combination with the PAR workstations
should permit DPMs to manage the risk of quoting 100-contract markets.

As indicated above, under this proposed rule change and in accordance with CBOE Rule 8.51, affected DPMs will be obligated
to provide firm quotes for up to 100 contracts on non-broker-dealer customer orders only. Under the proposal, the
firm quote size minimum will not apply whenever a ``fast market'' is declared,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and may be suspended for any class or series on a case by case basis as determined by the CBOE's Market Performance Committee
(``MPC''). These exceptions are consistent with the firm quote commitment requirements for other options traded
on the Exchange.

Generally, CBOE Rule 6.6 provides that whenever in the judgment of any two floor officials, because of an influx of

those floor officials may declare the market in one or more classes of option contracts to be ``fast''.

III. Findings and Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the CBOE's proposal serves to facilitate transactions in securities, and
to protect investors and the public interest.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE's proposal is designed to benefit non-broker-dealer customers by increasing the size of orders for which
they can be assured executions to a minimum depth of 100 contracts for interest rate options. Although the Commission
carefully scrutinizes discriminatory order execution practices, limiting the 100 contract minimum to non-broker-dealer
customers is consistent with the purposes of the Act. The intent of the 100 contract minimum is to allow DPMs in interest
rate options to become more competitive in making markets, thereby contributing to a more free and open market and
facilitating customer orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the larger markets created by increasing the minimum firm-quote contract size could
result in tighter spreads. This in turn should contribute to a more liquid options market, to the benefit of all market
participants. Furthermore, increasing the minimum DPM quote sizes available to customer orders furthers the underlying
purposes of the CBOE's firm quote rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By limiting the applicability of the 100 minimum contract size to classes of interest rate options for which PAR workstations
are available, the CBOE's proposal addresses the need of DPMs to have flexibility in adjusting their quotes beyond
that which is provided by the Exchange's Autoquote System alone.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The ``fast market'' exception of Rule 6.6 also addresses such concerns by providing DPMs relief during fast moving
markets.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Although the CBOE Rules will continue to allow the MPC to grant exemptions from the 100 contract firm quote requirement
on a case by case basis,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission believes such exemptions should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The presence of the PAR Workstation enhances the benefits already provided by the Exchange's Autoquote System. Autoquote
changes DPMs' published quotes automatically in response to changed market conditions; the PAR workstations allow
DPMs greater quote flexibility than that provided by the CBOE's Autoquote System by itself.

The Commission believes that the CBOE rules will ensure that those DPMs required to meet the 100 contract firm quote
guarantee for interest rate options will be adequately capitalized to handle the increased guarantee. In this regard,
CBOE Rules will continue to require that member organizations subject to Rule 15c3&hyph;1 under the Act comply with
the capital requirements prescribed therein, as well as comply with certain additional requirements of the CBOE.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also notes that the CBOE's proposal will be introduced gradually, and initially will only apply to
30-year bond interest rate options. As the use of PAR workstations extends to other classes of interest rate options,
so too will the applicability of the 100 contract firm quote minimum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 2 serves to clarify the operation of the Exchange's systems as they relate
to a DPM's firm quote responsibilities. Specifically, Amendment No. 2 describes how PAR workstations, together
with the CBOE's existing Autoquote System, allow DPMs to adjust quotes with speed and flexibility. In clarifying
the operation of the Exchange's systems, Amendment No. 2 does not create any substantive changes to the CBOE's proposal.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment
No. 2 to the CBOE's proposal on an accelerated basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 2 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. All submissions should

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar to MCC's and SCCP's current interfaces with NSCC's FITS for municipal securities,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 all trade comparisons for corporate bonds and UITs will be conducted at NSCC and not at either MCC or SCCP. Under the
expanded interfaces, the earlier cutoff times for the input by MCC and SCCP participants of two-side original trade
information that were previously applicable for municipal securities trades now will be applicable to trades in
corporate bonds and unit investment trusts. MCC's cutoff time for submission by its participants of original trade
input will be 7:00 P.M. (central time) on the trade date and 4:00 P.M. (central time) on the day following the trade date
(``T+1'') for supplemental trade input. SCCP's cutoff time for submission by its participants of original trade
input will be 1:00 A.M. (eastern time) on trade date, and adjustments to original trade input must be made prior to 4:00
P.M. (eastern time) on T+1.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Because NSCC will be transmitting comparison reports to MCC and SCCP reflecting the compared trades of MCC and SCCP
participants early in the morning on T+1, MCC and SCCP will produce contract reports for their participants by 8:00
A.M. (central time) and 9:00 A.M. (eastern time), respectively, on T+1. The interface will enable MCC and SCCP participants
to take full advantage of the NSCC expansion of FITS.

 that the proposed rule changes filed by MCC and SCCP further this goal.

MCC and SCCP have requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the
thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving
the proposed rule changes because accelerated approval will allow MCC participants and SCCP participants to utilize
and to take full advantage of the benefits of the expanded FITS as soon as it is operational at NSCC. Furthermore, the
Commission has previously published notice of and approved NSCC's implementation of the enhanced FITS. NSCC's proposed
rule change did not generate any comment letters, and none are expected on MCC's and SCCP's proposals.

NSCC is amending its Rule 50, Section 9 to allow an NSCC member to whom a customer's securities account is being transferred
(``receiving member'') one business day after receipt of the customer account asset data report from NSCC to determine
whether to accept the account, to reject the account, or to request that the NSCC member who currently maintains the
account (``delivering member'') make adjustments to the account. Currently, receiving members have two business
days to respond after receiving the customer account asset data report. Where Mutual Fund Services eligible book
share mutual fund assets are to be transferred, a receiving member again will have one business day instead of two business
days after receipt of the customer account asset data report to submit detailed transfer instructions to NSCC. During
the one day review period, a delivering member is able to add, to delete, or to change an item in the securities account
being transferred. Each business day that the delivering member causes an adjustment to be made to an account will
give the receiving member one additional business day after each adjustment to accept, to reject, or to request adjustments
or in the case of mutual funds to submit transfer instructions. Currently, receiving member have two business days
after each adjustment. Additionally, the proposed rule change deletes language that treats account transfers containing
option positions differently from transfers of accounts without option positions.

II. Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that NSCC's rule change shortening
the time period for transferring accounts should result in benefits to both customers and members by increasing efficiency
in the transfer of accounts. NSCC's proposed rule change is made in conjunction with the NYSE's and the NASD's rule
changes governing their members' transfers of customer accounts; therefore, the Commission believes the proposal
fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
In addition, reducing the time for account transfers is consistent with Commission Rule 15c6&hyph;1 mandating a
three business day settlement cycle effective June 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consolidated Natural Gas Company, CNG Tower, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222&hyph;3199 (``Consolidated''),
a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment to its declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prior Commission orders in this proceeding dated November 27, 1985, March 20, 1986 and December 18, 1989 (HCAR Nos.
23925, 24053 and 25003, respectively), Consolidated was authorized to issue 364,616 shares of its common stock,
$2.75 par value (``Common Stock''), from time-to-time through December 31, 1994, to the agent for participants in
Consolidated's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (``DRP'') and to the Trustees of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (``ESOP'')
of Consolidated and its participating subsidiaries. Of the total number of shares authorized, Consolidated allocated
210,348 and 154,268 shares, respectively, to the DRP and ESOP. It is anticipated that 133,251 shares of Common Stock
allocated to the ESOP will remain unissued as of December 31, 1994. All shares allocated to the DRP have been issued.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidated proposes to continue the ESOP and, at the option of its Board of Directors (``Board''), distribute to
participants either authorized and unissued Common Stock or outstanding Common Stock purchased in the open market.
Authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock will be issued whenever additional equity capital is needed by Consolidated.
The per share price of original issue Common Stock purchased from Consolidated will be the average of the closing price
of Consolidated's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Consolidated tape for the 20 consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the date of transfer. Consolidated will use the proceeds from the sale of such shares for general
corporate purposes. Whenever additional equity capital is not needed by Consolidated, ESOP shares will be acquired
through open market purchases by the ESOP trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ESOP is noncontributory on the employee's part and is administered by trustees. No one has the right to vote any
shares acquired by the ESOP other than the participants who own such shares. The Board has the right to adjust the number
of shares reserved under the ESOP which may be issued in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants'
rights under the ESOP in the event of a stock split, reserve stock split, reorganization or similar event with respect
to which the Board determines that an equitable adjustment is appropriate. Consolidated requests authority to issue
said 133,251 shares, or such shares as may respectively remain unissued at December 31, 1994, until such numbers shall
be exhausted, but not beyond December 31, 1999. Consolidated further requests authority to adjust the number and
par value (if appropriate) of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the ESOP in the implementation of the anticipation
or anti-enlargement of rights provisions of the ESOP.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company, CNG Tower, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222&hyph;3199 (``Consolidated''),
a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment to its declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of
the Act.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prior Commission orders, dated November 27, 1985, March 20, 1986 and December 18, 1989 (HCAR Nos. 23926, 24052 and
25002, respectively), Consolidated was authorized to issue 1,500,000 shares of its common stock, $2.75 par value
(``Common Stock''), from time-to-time through December 31, 1994, to the agent for participants in Consolidated's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (``DRP''). Pursuant to those orders, 84,097 shares of Common Stock have been issued through
September 8, 1994. It is anticipated that 1,415,903 shares of Common Stock allocated to the DRP will remain unissued
as of December 31, 1994.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidated proposes to continue the DRP and, at the option of its Board of Directors (``Board''), offer participants
either authorized and unissued Common Stock or outstanding Common Stock purchased in the open market. Authorized
and unissued shares of Common Stock will be issued whenever additional equity capital is needed by Consolidated.
The per share price of original issue Common Stock purchase from Consolidated will be the closing price of Consolidated's
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Consolidated tape on the dividend payment date. Consolidated will use
the proceeds from the sale of such shares for general corporate purposes. Whenever additional equity capital is not
needed by Consolidated, DRP shares will be acquired through open market purchases by Society National Bank (``Society'')
in Cleveland, Ohio, which will continue to act as agent for stockholders participating in the DRP. Consolidated will
absorb all brokerage commissions and administrative charges, such as agent fees.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No one has the right to vote any shares acquired through the DRP other than the respective participants in the DRP who
own such shares. The Board has the right to adjust the number of shares reserved under the DRP which may be issued in order
to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights under the DRP in the event of a stock split, reverse stock
split, reorganization or similar event with respect to which the Board determines that an equitable adjustment is
appropriate. Consolidated requests authority to issue 1,415,903 shares of Common Stock, or such shares as may actually
remain unissued at December 31, 1994, to Society as agent for the DRP until such number shall be exhausted, but not beyond
December 31, 1999. Consolidated further requests authority to adjust the number and par value (if appropriate) of
shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the DRP in the implementation of the anti-dilution of rights provisions
of the DRP.

Central Power and Light Company (``CPL''), 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401, an electric utility
subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective
amendment to its application, previously filed under sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act, under sections 9(a) and 10 of
the Act and Rule 54 thereunder.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated April 13, 1989 (HCAR No. 24863), the Commission authorized CPL to lease to nonaffiliated third parties:
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Approximately 23,400 square feet of excess space on the first two floors of its corporate headquarters building,
located at 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas (``Headquarters Building''); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Approximately 17,800 square feet of excess space on the third and fourth floors, in the basement and on the roof
of the Headquarters Building; and  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Space in one of its former office buildings pending eventual sale of the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPL now proposes to lease to Enron Oil &amp; Gas Company, a nonaffiliated third party (``Enron''), approximately
34,954 square feet of excess space in Headquarters Building (``Leased Space''). CPL has entered into a Lease Agreement,
dated September 16, 1994, with Enron providing for such lease, as supplemented by a letter, dated September 22, 1994,
from CPL to Enron (``Lease''). The obligations of CPL under the Lease are subject to and conditioned upon receipt by
CPL of all required governmental and regulatory approvals, including this Commission's. The term of the Lease is
for five years, commencing on November 1, 1994 and ending on October 31, 1999, unless certain improvements to the Leased
Space have not been completed or all required governmental and regulatory approvals have not been received by November
1, 1994. In the case of such a delay, the term of the lease will commence when such improvements have been completed or
such approvals have been obtained and will end five years thereafter.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rental payments due under the Lease are $30,584.75 per month, equivalent to an annual rental rate of $10.50 per
square foot of ``net rentable area,'' as defined in the Lease. The rental payments are subject to increase in accordance
with increases in a specified Consumer Price Index and to other customary adjustments. The Lease also provides for
a grant by CPL to Enron of a ``tenant finish allowance'' of $325,072.20 or $9.30 per square foot of net rentable area
for the purpose of constructing improvements to the Leased Space. This allowance is payable as work on improvements
to the Leased Space is performed and, to the extent not expended on improvements, shall be credited to rent due under
the Lease. Under the Lease, CPL is to pay a brokerage fee to Enron Property Company, an affiliate of Enron, of $73,403.40
or 4% of the gross rental due over the term of the Lease. Such fee is payable within ten days after the date the Lease becomes
effective. CPL believes that the rental payments, the tenant finish allowance and the brokerage fee provided for
in the Lease, taken together, will result in net rental payments that are at or near market rates for space comparable
to the Leased Space.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPL has also agreed to give Enron a right of first refusal to lease any additional space on two floors of the Headquarters
Building that might become available for lease during the term of the Lease. Such provisions as to additional space
are in addition to and independent of the provisions governing the Leased Space. Any lease of such additional space
would be for the remaining unexpired term of the Lease, at an annual rental rate per square foot equal to the rate to be
paid under the Lease. The lease would also provide for a tenant finish allowance per square foot equal to the allowance
to be paid under the Lease, but proportionately reduced to reflect the portion of the term of the Lease that will have
then expired. In all other respects, the lease of such additional space would be on the same terms and conditions as
are contained in the Lease.

NU, CL&amp;P, WMECO, Holyoke, Nuclear and Rocky River are patties to the $360 million multi-bank revolving credit
facility (the ``NU System Facility''). By order dated Nov. 23, 1992 (HCAR No. 25683, creation of the facility was authorized.
By order dated Dec. 16, 1992 and May 5, 1994 (HCAR Nos. 25710 and 26046, respectively), PSNH was authorized to create
its own $125 million multi-bank revolving credit facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is also stated that North Atlantic and HEC will be entitled to borrow through the Money Pool only if and to the extent
that funds in the Money Pool attributable to contributions from Northeast are available for such borrowings. PSNH
will not be entitled to borrow funds through the Money Pool that are attributable to contributions from WMECO unless
and until the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities has issued an order authorizing WMECO to lend funds to
PSNH through the Money Pool. PSNH's participation in the Money Pool is only expected to be a back up to the PSNH Facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All borrowings from the contributions to the Money Pool, including the open account advances, will be documented
and will be evidenced on the books of each Applicant that is borrowing from or contributing surplus funds to the Money
Pool. Any Applicant contributing funds to the Money Pool may withdraw those funds at any time without notice to satisfy
its daily need for funds. Except for loans from the proceeds of external borrowings by Northeast, all loans will be
payable on demand, may be prepaid by any borrowing Applicant at any time without premium or penalty and will bear interest
for both the borrower and lender, payable monthly, equal to the daily Federal Funds Effective Rate as quoted by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Loans from the proceeds of external borrowings by Northeast will bear interest at
the same rate paid by Northeast on its borrowings, and no such loans may be prepaid unless Northeast is made whole for
any additional costs that may be incurred because of such prepayment. Northeast will be fully reimbursed for all costs
that it incurs in relation to loans made to the other Applicants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If no such short-term needs match the amount of funds that are available for the period such funds are available, the
Applicants state that the funds in the Money Pool will be invested in:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of
the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the U.S.; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any state or political subdivision thereof, provided that such obligations
are rated for investment purposes at not less than ``A'' by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (``Moody's'') or by Standard
&amp; Poors Corporation (``S&amp;P'');  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Commercial paper rated not less than ``P&hyph;1'' by Moody's or not less than ``A&hyph;1'' by S&amp;P; or  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Such other instruments as are permitted by Rule 40(a)(1) under the Act and approved by the Massachusetts Department
of Public Utilities (``DPU'') pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 164, section 17A and the regulations
thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicants (other than North Atlantic, HEC and Quinnehtuk) also request authority to secure both formal and informal
credit lines with a number of lending institutions. Formal credit lines may be subject to compensating balance and/or
fee requirements and will therefore be used only when an Applicant determines that such a credit line offers advantages
as compared with other available credit options. Compensating balance requirements will not exceed 5% of the committed
credit line amount, and fees will not exceed 0.30% per annum. Each Applicant participating in a credit line would be
able to draw funds to the exclusion of the other Applicants. The Applicants may change their credit lines and may obtain
additional lines over time. The continued availability of such credit lines is subject to the continuing review of
the lending institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Applicants (other than North Atlantic, HEC and Quinnehtuk) propose to issue Short-Term Notes pursuant
to such formal and formal lines of credit. Short-Term Notes will be issued both on a transactional basis, with a separate
note evidencing each loan, and on a so-called grid note (``Grid Note'') basis, as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Short-Term Note issued on transactional basis will be dated the date of issue, will have a maximum term of 270 days,
and will bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Such Short-Term Notes will be issued no later than December 31, 1996,
and will (except as described below) be subject to prepayment at any time at the borrower's option. From time-to-time,
an Applicant may use a different form of Short-Term Note containing customary terms to evidence its borrowings, if
necessary, to satisfy the needs of a particular lender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Short-Term Notes issued on a Grid Note basis will be issued by an Applicant to a particular lending institution at or
prior to the first borrowing under the Grid Note from that lender by the Applicant. Each repayment and reborrowing
subsequent to the first borrowing will be recorded on a schedule to the note without the necessity of issuing additional
notes. Also recorded on a schedule to the note at the time of a borrowing will be the date of the borrowing, the maturity
(which may not exceed 270 days from the date of the borrowing), the number of days the borrowing is outstanding, the
interest rate or method of determining the interest rate, the amount of interest due, and the date of payment. Except
as described below, borrowings on a Grid Note basis will be subject to prepayment at any time at the borrower's option.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interest rate on all Short-Term Notes will be determined on the basis of competitive quotations from several lending
institutions, and will either be at a fixed interest rate or at a floating interest rate determined with reference
to an agreed-upon index (such as a Lending institution's prime rate, the London InterBank Offered Rate, certificate
of deposit rates, money market rates or commercial paper rates). The interest rate in any case will not exceed two percentage
points above the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The Applicants will select the lending institution(s) from which
to make a particular short-term borrowing and determine whether to borrow at a fixed or a floating rate on the basis
of the lowest expected effective interest cost for borrowings of comparable sizes and maturities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Borrowings bearing floating interest rates will generally be subject to prepayment at the borrower's option. The
Applicants believe that many lending institutions lending funds at fixed interest rates are engaged in ``matched
funding,'' i.e., such lenders acquire for comparable maturities the funds that are lent to their borrowers. Because
the lenders would remain obligated under their own borrowings from others if the Applicants were to prepay their borrowings
in advance of their scheduled maturities, many lending institutions lending funds at fixed interest rates stipulate
that such borrowings may not be prepaid or may be prepaid only with a premium that will make the lender whole for any losses
(including lost profits) it may incur. Accordingly, in order to realize the benefits of fixed interest rates when
a fixed-rate borrowing is evaluated to be the lowest cost borrowing available, the Applicants may from time to time
agree with individual lenders that such borrowings may not be prepaid or may only be prepaid if the lender is made whole
for its losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CL&amp;P, WMECO and Northeast request authority to continue to sell Commercial Paper publicly. Such Commercial
Paper will be issued through the Depository Trust Company in the form of book entry notes in denominations of not less
than $50,000, of varying maturities, with no maturity more than 270 days after the date of issue. The Commercial Paper
will not be repayable prior to maturity. The Commercial Paper will be sold through a placement agent or agents in a co-managed
commercial paper program pursuant to a placement agent agreement at either the discount rate per annum or the interest
rate per annum prevailing at the date of issuance for commercial paper of comparable quality and of the particular
maturity sold by public utility issuers thereof. No Commercial Paper will be issued unless the issuing Applicant
believes that the effective interest cost to the Applicant will be equal to or less than the effective interest rate
at which the applicant could issue Short-Term Notes in an amount at least equal to the principal amount of such Commercial
Paper. The placement agent or agents will receive a commission for the sale of the Commercial Paper of not more than
1/8 of 1% per annum, on a discounted basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as otherwise described herein and unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, any short-term borrowings
of the Applicants outstanding at December 31, 1996 will either be repaid from internal cash resources or from the proceeds
of long-term debt or equity financing or remain outstanding if the Commission authorizes the Applicants to continue
such short-term borrowings after December 31, 1996.

The Sperry Rail, Inc., (SRIX) seeks a permanent waiver of compliance from all provisions of 49 CFR part 240, Qualification
Standards for Locomotive Engineers. The SRIX operates 37 self-propelled rail testing cars utilizing their own operators,
and a railroad employee acting as a pilot who is qualified on the physical characteristics and operating rules over
the railroad it is being operated on. The SRIX argues that their operators are well trained and would not benefit from
part 240 certification requirements. The SRIX also argues that the cost of certification would make them non-competitive
due to increased labor costs.

The Association of American Railroads (AAR) seeks an interim waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the
Railroad Freight Car Safety Standards, 49 CFR Part 215. The AAR is requesting an exemption from the requirement of
49 CFR 215.103(h) which requires the removal from service of freight car wheels that show signs of having been overheated
as evidenced by reddish brown discoloration, as it is applied to heat-treated curved-plate wheels. As a result of
a petition by the AAR (Rulemaking Petition No. 93&hyph;1), the FRA intends to initiate a rulemaking addressing the
proposal to revise 49 CFR 215.103(h) as it applies to heat-treated curved-plate (HT&hyph;CP) freight car wheels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAR indicates that it is filing this petition for an interim waiver to address the situation while the rulemaking process
proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAR requests that FRA issue a waiver providing in substance, that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR 215.103 shall not prohibit a railroad from placing or continuing in service a freight car if the only reason for
such prohibition is one or more wheels that are discolored as described in 49 CFR 215.103(h), provided:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Each such discolored wheel is heat-treated and is of curve-plate design,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Each such wheel is identified as a heat-treated curved-plate wheel in accordance with AAR interchange rules,
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The railroad has submitted to FRA and to AAR a written agreement to participate in the Data Collection Program
on Premature Wheel Failure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAR cites the following justification for the waiver request:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. HT&hyph;CP wheels are extraordinarily resistant to the development of residual tensile rim stresses which are
a precondition for wheel fracture.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The resistance of HT&hyph;CP wheels to development of residual tensile rim stress is a function of the design of
the wheels and the manufacturing processes used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In-service wheel failure data and experimental data show that HT&hyph;CP wheels have an incidence of residual
tensile rim stress and of wheel failure that is approximately the same as non-discolored HT&hyph;CP wheels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Transport Canada, the Canadian rail safety agency, does not prohibit the use of discolored curved-plate wheels
on railroad freight cars. Canadian data collected over nine years similarly show that discolored and non-discolored
HT&hyph;CP wheels fail for residual tensile rim stress related reasons at approximately the same rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. New air brake testing procedures have significantly reduced the likelihood of sticking brakes_the principal
cause of the development of residual tensile rim stress in HT&hyph;CP wheels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Removal of HT&hyph;CP wheels costs the railroad industry approximately $40 million per year, yet provides no discernible
safety benefit.

Pursuant to the provisions of the ``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C. 552b), notice is hereby given that at
10:02 a.m. on Tuesday, October 25, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation met in
closed session to consider matters relating to the Corporation's supervisory activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In calling the meeting, the Board determined, on motion of Director Jonathan L. Fiechter (Acting Director, Office
of Thrift Supervision), seconded by Mr. Stephen R. Steinbrink, acting in the place and stead of Director Eugene A.
Ludwig (Comptroller of the Currency), concurred in by Vice Chairman Andrew C. Hove, Jr., and Chairman Ricki R. Tigert,
that Corporation business required its consideration of the matters on less than seven days' notice to the public;
that no earlier notice of the meeting was practicable; that the public interest did not require consideration of the
matters in a meeting open to public observation; and that the matters could be considered in a closed meeting by authority
of subsections (c)(4), (c)(6), (c)(8), (c)(9)(A)(ii), and (c)(9)(B) of the ``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5
U.S.C. 552b) (c)(4), (c)(6), (c)(8), (c)(9)(A)(ii), and (c)(9)(B)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 52810 with a 60-day comment period (which was extended to January 13, 1994). More than 2500 comments were received
and reviewed. The following represents a summary of all major comments and a response to each. All comments were reviewed
and considered in developing the final guidelines. Changes were also made to increase clarity and readability.

 Rationale for selecting six patients per year in a given area as a criterion for risk level seems arbitrarily defined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This criterion is based on surveys conducted by CDC in conjunction with the American Hospital Association, the Society
for Health Care Epidemiology of America, and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.
These surveys suggest an increased risk of tuberculin skin test conversion in employees working in facilities admitting
six or more TB patients per year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Repeat skin testing at 3-month intervals in high-risk settings is too frequent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The high-risk setting is essentially an outbreak setting, in which there is evidence of transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this situation, it is reasonable to conduct follow-up skin testing 12 weeks (3 months) after the initial testing.
If there is no evidence of further transmission and any deficiencies in infection control practices and facilities
have been corrected, the area is no longer considered high risk, and there is no need to continue testing every 3 months.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A cluster of skin test conversions is defined as two or more conversions in one area within 3 months; however, because
of the limitations of skin testing, this may not represent true conversions due to nosocomial transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is assumed that a cluster would be investigated to determine the likelihood that it truly represents nosocomial
transmission. The situation would be classified as high risk only if this evaluation supported a conclusion that
nosocomial transmission had occurred. The recommendation will be modified to clarify this point.

 Clarified: 6 ACHs are an absolute minimum, and a level of 12 or more ACHs are recommended, especially in new construction.
Referred to table S3&hyph;1, which provides the number of air changes per hour and the minutes required for removal
efficiencies of 90.0%, 99.0%, and 99.9%. The 12 ACHs or more recommendation was arrived at by both use of this table
and NIOSH experimental data. Added discussion on the benefits of higher ventilation and recommended ideal performance
criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because smoke can be an irritant, the use of smoke tubes for continuous pressure monitoring should be replaced with
flutter strips. Daily monitoring of negative pressure is unnecessary and labor intensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Made no change in the recommended monitoring schedule. The concern over the use of smoke tubes is unfounded. Controlled
tests by NIOSH have shown that the quantity of smoke that is released is so minute that it is not measurable in the air.
The location of the patient and the length of time the patient is exposed dilute the smoke to several orders of magnitude
below an 8-hour exposure limit. It is not practical and often not effective to use flutter strips or continuous monitoring
devices as alternatives to indicate directional air movement. The air flow (due usually to the small clearance area
under a door) is insufficient to move the flutter strip. Likewise, low negative pressure, which will satisfactorily
provide adequate directional air flow into the isolation room, may not be readable on continuous monitoring devices.
Devices must be capable of reading 0.001 inch of water, the established minimum, to be effective. Clarified the overall
guidance in this area by indicating the use of smoke as the optimum test procedure and clearly stating the potential
results of flutter strips and continuous instrumentation. Used illustrations to clarify procedures for setting
negative pressure.

 HEPA filtered masks are too expensive, and no data support their use. Instituting a fit-testing program and, in general,
a respiratory protection program is too expensive. HCWs will not wear the masks. The masks are uncomfortable, impede
communication, and interfere with general patient care.

such as dust-mist and dust-fume-mist were removed. Removed the respiratory protection table and accompanying performance
characteristics in the supplement in anticipation of the new certification process. Retained the explanations
about fit, fit testing and fit checking, and the elements of a respiratory protection program. Added a statement about
ongoing research being conducted on various forms of respiratory protection.

 The performance criteria for respiratory protection for HCWs exposed to tuberculosis fail to take into consideration
the potential higher level of risk for workers in selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed on patients suspected
of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having TB at the time of death).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 26850) a Notice of Proposed Rule Making on revised certification requirements for respiratory protective
devices. The certification of air-purifying respirators under these proposed requirements would enable respirator
users to select from a broader range of certified respirators that meet the current performance criteria in this document.

 It is unclear which facilities must have a respiratory protection program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Clarified that facilities that do not have isolation rooms for TB, that do not perform cough-inducing procedures,
and refer all potential TB patients need not have a respirator program but must perform a periodic risk assessment,
have protocols for referral, and an infection control plan that is periodically reviewed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, the comments supported the concept of education for HCWs. Persons from a number of specialties noted that
educational programs should be flexible and should allow for the selection of information to be included in these
programs and that the frequency of training should be based on the risk of TB transmission in the facility or area. Some
suggested emphasis on educating physicians in the early recognition and proper treatment for persons with tuberculosis.
Because of difficulties with compliance with attendance and the time needed away from the job in the busy health care
environment, concern was expressed about the increasing requirements for mandatory annual educational training
sessions on various subjects (bloodborne pathogens, fire safety, hazardous exposure). A few persons suggested
that CDC provide standardized training materials. A few commented on the expense of the training program, including
the respirator training program.

 Most of the comments on this section were very favorable. Some persons commented that the HIV-infected HCW may not
report their infection to the facility and asked about the facility's responsibility to HCWs and to patients should
this occur. Some expressed concern about confidentiality and about the Americans with Disabilities Act.

 Reemphasized the need to tailor each program to fit the situation. The infection rate in a particular facility, the
time of year (e.g., flu season), the potential exposure of individual workers_all these need to be taken into consideration.

Annual PPD testing in areas of low prevalence is unnecessary. It is unclear which HCWs should be tested. Provide clearer
information on the number of conversions during a specified period to trigger the testing of others from the same area
or group.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two-step skin testing is not necessary for all HCWs, especially those who are transferring from hospitals and whose
PPD results are negative and those from areas where the prevalence of booster phenomenon is low or where boosting was
assessed as no problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clarified that 2-step testing is not necessary if an HCW has had a documented negative PPD result in the past 12 months
or if the institution has determined that boosting is not common in their population. Also added the potential consequences
of misinterpreting a boosted reaction as a new infection.

 antimicrobial susceptibilities should be recorded in the HCW's medical record and given to the employee if he or she
leaves the facility. The HCW can then be put on appropriate therapy if active disease develops. Persons who are PPD
positive and have not had adequate preventive therapy should be monitored at least annually.

 Requiring three consecutive negative smears before an HCW who is receiving treatment for active TB can return to work
is excessive. A person who has improved does not cough and does not produce sputum and may be kept off duty unnecessarily.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Confusion had been caused by an incorrect wording in the guidelines, that ``negative smears on consecutive days''
were required. This has been clarified. The recommendation for 3 consecutive negative smears collected on separate

Executive Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This document updates and replaces all previously published guidelines for the prevention of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transmission in health-care facilities. The purpose of this revision is to emphasize the importance of (a) the hierarchy
of control measures, including administrative and engineering controls and personal respiratory protection;
(b) the use of risk assessments for developing a written tuberculosis (TB) control plan; (c) early identification
and management of persons who have TB; (d) TB screening programs for health-care workers (HCWs); (e) HCW training
and education; and (f) the evaluation of TB infection-control programs.

Transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is a recognized risk to patients and HCWs in health-care facilities. Transmission is most likely to occur from patients
who have unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal TB, are not on effective anti-TB therapy, and have not been placed in
TB isolation. Several recent TB outbreaks in health-care facilities, including outbreaks of multidrug-resistant
TB, have heightened concern about nosocomial transmission. Patients who have multidrug-resistant TB can remain
infectious for prolonged periods, which increases the risk for nosocomial and/or occupational transmission of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Increases in the incidence of TB have been observed in some geographic areas; these increases are related partially
to the high risk for TB among immunosuppressed persons, particularly those infected with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV). Transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to HIV-infected persons is of particular concern because these persons are at high risk for developing active TB if
they become infected with the bacteria. Thus, health-care facilities should be particularly alert to the need for
preventing transmission of
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in settings in which HIV-infected persons work or receive care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supervisory responsibility for the TB infection-control program should be assigned to a designated person or group
of persons who should be given the authority to implement and enforce TB infection-control policies. An effective
TB infection-control program requires early identification, isolation, and treatment of persons who have active
TB. The primary emphasis of TB infection-control plans in health-care facilities should be achieving these three
goals by the application of a hierarchy of control measures, including (a) the use of administrative measures to reduce
the risk for exposure to persons who have infectious TB, (b) the use of engineering controls to prevent the spread and
reduce the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei, and (c) the use of personal respiratory protective equipment
in areas where there is still a risk for exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (e.g., TB isolation rooms). Implementation of a TB infection-control program requires risk assessment and development
of a TB infection-control plan; early identification, treatment, and isolation of infectious TB patients; effective
engineering controls; an appropriate respiratory protection program; HCW TB training, education, counseling,
and screening; and evaluation of the program's effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Although completely eliminating the risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in all health-care facilities may not be possible at the present time, adherence to these guidelines should reduce
the risk to persons in these settings. Recently, nosocomial TB outbreaks have demonstrated the substantial morbidity
and mortality among patients and HCWs that have been associated with incomplete implementation of CDC's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1992, the National MDR&hyph;TB Task Force published the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Action Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The publication was a response to reported nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB), including outbreaks of
multidrug-resistant TB (MDR&hyph;TB), and the increasing incidence of TB in some geographic areas. The plan called
for the update and revision of the guidelines for preventing nosocomial transmission of

). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public meetings were held in October 1992 and January 1993 to discuss revision of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1990 TB Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). CDC received considerable input on various aspects of infection control, including health-care worker (HCW)
education; administrative controls (e.g., having protocols for the early identification and management of patients
who have TB); the need for more specific recommendations regarding ventilation; and clarification on the use of respiratory
protection in health-care settings. On the basis of these events and the input received, on October 12, 1993, CDC published
in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

). During and after the 90-day comment period following publication of this draft, CDC's TB Infection-Control Guidelines
Work Group received and reviewed more than 2,500 comments.

The purpose of this document is to make recommendations for reducing the risk for transmitting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to HCWs, patients, volunteers, visitors, and other persons in these settings. The information also may serve as a
useful resource for educating HCWs about TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These recommendations update and replace all previously published CDC recommendations for TB infection control
in health-care facilities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2, 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The recommendations in this document are applicable primarily to inpatient facilities in which health care is
provided (e.g., hospitals, medical wards in correctional facilities, nursing homes, and hospices). Recommendations
applicable to ambulatory-care facilities, emergency departments, home-health-care settings, emergency medical
services, medical offices, dental settings, and other facilities or residential settings that provide medical
care are provided in separate sections, with cross-references to other sections of the guidelines if appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designated personnel at health-care facilities should conduct a risk assessment for the entire facility and for
each area* and occupational group, determine the risk for nosocomial or occupational transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and implement an appropriate TB infection-control program. The extent of the TB infection-control program may range
from a simple program emphasizing administrative controls in settings where there is minimal risk for exposure to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to a comprehensive program that includes administrative controls, engineering controls, and respiratory protection
in settings where the risk for exposure is high. In all settings, administrative measures should be used to minimize
the number of HCWs exposed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 while still providing optimal care for TB patients. HCWs providing care to patients who have TB should be informed
about the level of risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and the appropriate control measures to minimize that risk.

B. Epidemiology, Transmission, and Pathogenesis of TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prevalence of TB is not distributed evenly throughout all segments of the U.S. population. Some subgroups or persons
have a higher risk for TB either because they are more likely than other persons in the general population to have been
exposed to and infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or because their infection is more likely to progress to active TB after they have been infected (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). In some cases, both of these factors may be present. Groups of persons known to have a higher prevalence of TB infection
include contacts of persons who have active TB, foreign-born persons from areas of the world with a high prevalence
of TB (e.g., Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America), medically underserved populations (e.g., some African-Americans,
Hispanics, Asians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives), homeless persons, current or
former correctional-facility inmates, alcoholics, injecting-drug users, and the elderly. Groups with a higher
risk for progression from latent TB infection to active disease include persons who have been infected recently (i.e.,
within the previous 2 years), children less than &lt;4 years of age, persons with fibrotic lesions on chest radiographs,
and persons with certain medical conditions (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, silicosis, gastrectomy
or jejuno-ileal bypass, being "10% below ideal body weight, chronic renal failure with renal dialysis, diabetes
mellitus, immunosuppression resulting from receipt of high-dose corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy,
and some malignancies) (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is carried in airborne particles, or droplet nuclei, that can be generated when persons who have pulmonary or laryngeal
TB sneeze, cough, speak, or sing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The particles are an estimated 1&hyph;5 &mu;m in size, and normal air currents can keep them airborne for prolonged
time periods and spread them throughout a room or building (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Infection occurs when a susceptible person inhales droplet nuclei containing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and these droplet nuclei traverse the mouth or nasal passages, upper respiratory tract, and bronchi to reach the
alveoli of the lungs. Once in the alveoli, the organisms are taken up by alveolar macrophages and spread throughout
the body. Usually within 2&hyph;10 weeks after initial infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the immune response limits further multiplication and spread of the tubercle bacilli; however, some of the bacilli
remain dormant and viable for many years. This condition is referred to as latent TB infection. Persons with latent
TB infection usually have positive purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test results, but they do
not have symptoms of active TB, and they are not infectious.

have approximately a 10% risk for developing active TB during their lifetimes. This risk is greatest during the first
2 years after infection. Immunocompromised persons have a greater risk for the progression of latent TB infection
to active TB disease; HIV infection is the strongest known risk factor for this progression. Persons with latent TB
infection who become coinfected with HIV have approximately an 8%&hyph;10% risk per year for developing active TB
(

M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will become infected depends primarily on the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei in the air and the duration
of exposure. Characteristics of the TB patient that enhance transmission include (a) disease in the lungs, airways,
or larynx; (b) presence of cough or other forceful expiratory measures; (c) presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in
the sputum; (d) failure of the patient to cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; (e) presence of cavitation
on chest radiograph; (f) inappropriate or short duration of chemotherapy; and (g) administration of procedures
that can induce coughing or cause aerosolization of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(e.g., sputum induction). Environmental factors that enhance the likelihood of transmission include (a) exposure
in relatively small, enclosed spaces; (b) inadequate local or general ventilation that results in insufficient
dilution and/or removal of infectious droplet nuclei; and (c) recirculation of air containing infectious droplet
nuclei. Characteristics of the persons exposed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that may affect the risk for becoming infected are not as well defined. In general, persons who have been infected previously
with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
may be less susceptible to subsequent infection. However, reinfection can occur among previously infected persons,
especially if they are severely immunocompromised. Vaccination with Bacille of Calmette and Gu&eacute;rin (BCG)
probably does not affect the risk for infection; rather, it decreases the risk for progressing from latent TB infection
to active TB (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 is a recognized risk in health-care facilities (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
14&hyph;22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The magnitude of the risk varies considerably by the type of health-care facility, the prevalence of TB in the community,
the patient population served, the HCW's occupational group, the area of the health-care facility in which the HCW
works, and the effectiveness of TB infection-control interventions. The risk may be higher in areas where patients
with TB are provided care before diagnosis and initiation of TB treatment and isolation precautions (e.g., in clinic
waiting areas and emergency departments) or where diagnostic or treatment procedures that stimulate coughing are
performed. Nosocomial transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberclosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been associated with close contact with persons who have infectious TB and with the performance of certain procedures
(e.g., bronchoscopy [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
21,22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
]). Sputum induction and aerosol treatments that induce coughing may also increase the potential for transmission
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberclosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
23,24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Personnel of health-care facilities should be particularly alert to the need for preventing transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberclosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in those facilities in which immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV-infected persons) work or receive care_especially
if cough-inducing procedures, such as sputum induction and aerosolized pentamidine treatments, are being performed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several TB outbreaks among persons in health-care facilities have been reported recently (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
11,24&hyph;28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; CDC, unpublished data). Many of these outbreaks involved transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberclosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to both patients and HCWs. Most of the patients and some of the HCWs were HIV-infected persons in whom new infection
progressed rapidly to active disease. Mortality associated with those outbreaks was high (range: 43%&hyph;93%).
Furthermore, the interval between diagnosis and death was brief (range of median intervals: 4&hyph;16 weeks). Factors
contributing to these outbreaks included delayed diagnosis of TB, delayed recognition of drug resistance, and delayed
initiation of effective therapy_all of which resulted in prolonged infectiousness, delayed initiation and inadequate
duration of TB isolation, inadequate ventilation in TB isolation rooms, lapses in TB isolation practices and inadequate
precautions for cough-inducing procedures, and lack of adequate respiratory protection. Analysis of data collected
from three of the health-care facilities involved in the outbreaks indicates that transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberclosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decreased significantly or ceased entirely in areas where measures similar to those in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, several interventions were implemented simultaneously, and the effectiveness of the separate interventions
could not be determined.

D. Fundamentals of TB Infection Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An effective TB infection-control program requires early identification, isolation, and effective treatment
of persons who have active TB. The primary emphasis of the TB infection-control plan should be on achieving these three
goals. In all health-care facilities, particularly those in which persons who are at high risk for TB work or receive
care, policies and procedures for TB control should be developed, reviewed periodically, and evaluated for effectiveness
to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberclosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TB infection-control program should be based on a hierarchy of control measures. The first level of the hierarchy,
and that which affects the largest number of persons, is using administrative measures intended primarily to reduce
the risk for exposing uninfected persons to persons who have infectious TB. These measures include (a) developing
and implementing effective written policies and protocols to ensure the rapid identification, isolation, diagnostic
evaluation, and treatment of persons likely to have TB; (b) implementing effective work practices among HCWs in the
health-care facility (e.g., correctly wearing respiratory protection and keeping doors to isolation rooms closed);
(c) educating, training, and counseling HCWs about TB; and (d) screening HCWs for TB infection and disease.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second level of the hierarchy is the use of engineering controls to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration
of infectious droplet nuclei. These controls include (a) direct source control using local exhaust ventilation,
(b) controlling direction of airflow to prevent contamination of air in areas adjacent to the infectious source,
(c) diluting and removing contaminated air via general ventilation, and (d) air cleaning via air filtration or ultraviolet
germicidal irradiation (UVGI). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first two levels of the hierarchy minimize the number of areas in the health-care facility where exposure to infectious
TB may occur, and they reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk in those few areas where exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can still occur (e.g., rooms in which patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated and treatment
rooms in which cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures are performed on such patients). Because persons
entering such rooms may be exposed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the third level of the hierarchy is the use of personal respiratory protective equipment in these and certain other
situations in which the risk for infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be relatively higher.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Supervisory responsibility for the TB infection-control program should be assigned to a designated person
or group of persons with expertise in infection control, occupational health, and engineering. These persons should
be given the authority to implement and enforce TB infection-control policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If supervisory responsibility is assigned to a committee, one person should be designated as the TB contact
person. Questions and problems can then be addressed to this person.

1. Risk Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;TB infection-control measures for each health-care facility should be based on a careful assessment of the
risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in that particular setting. The first step in developing the TB infection-control program should be to conduct a baseline
risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in each area and occupational group in the facility (Table 1, Figure 1). Appropriate infection-control interventions
can then be developed on the basis of actual risk. Risk assessments should be performed for all inpatient and outpatient
settings (e.g., medical and dental offices). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regardless of risk level, the management of patients with known or suspected infectious TB should not vary.
However, the index of suspicion for infectious TB among patients, the frequency of HCW PPD skin testing, the number
of TB isolation rooms, and other factors will depend on whether the risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the facility, area, or occupational group is high, intermediate, low, very low, or minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The risk assessment should be conducted by a qualified person or group of persons (e.g., hospital epidemiologists,
infectious disease specialists, pulmonary disease specialists, infection-control practitioners, health-care
administrators, occupational health personnel, engineers, HCWs, or local public health personnel). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The risk assessment should be conducted for the entire facility and for specific areas within the facility
(e.g., medical, TB, pulmonary, or HIV wards; HIV, infectious disease, or pulmonary clinics; and emergency departments
or other areas where TB patients might receive care or where cough-inducing procedures are performed). This should
include both inpatient and outpatient areas. In addition, risk assessments should be conducted for groups of HCWs
who work throughout the facility rather than in a specific area (e.g., respiratory therapists; bronchoscopists;
environmental services, dietary, and maintenance personnel; and students, interns, residents, and fellows).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Classification of risk for a facility, for a specific area, and for a specific occupational group should be
based on (a) the profile of TB in the community; (b) the number of infectious TB patients admitted to the area or ward,
or the estimated number of infectious TB patients to whom HCWs in an occupational group may be exposed; and (c) the results
of analysis of HCW PPD test conversions (where applicable) and possible person-to-person transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Figure 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All TB infection-control programs should include periodic reassessments of risk. The frequency of repeat
risk assessments should be based on the results of the most recent risk assessment (Table 2, Figure 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``minimal-risk'' category applies only to an entire facility. A ``minimal-risk'' facility does not admit
TB patients to inpatient or outpatient areas and is not located in a community with TB (i.e., counties or communities
in which TB cases have not been reported during the previous year). Thus, there is essentially no risk for exposure
to TB patients in the facility. This category may also apply to many outpatient settings (e.g., many medical and dental
offices).

*Because very low-risk facilities do not admit patients who may have active TB to inpatient areas, most HCWs in such
facilities do not need routine follow-up PPD screening after baseline PPD testing is done. However, those who are
involved in the initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation of patients in the ambulatory-care, emergency, and

potentially to a patient who has active TB. These HCWs may need to receive routine periodic PPD screening. Similarly,
these HCWs may need to be included in a respiratory protection program.

Because very low-risk facilities do not admit patients suspected of having active TB, review of TB patient medical
records is not applicable. However, follow-up of patients who were identified during triage as possibly having active
TB and referred to another institution for further evaluation and management may be useful in evaluating the effectiveness
of the triage system.

Some minimal or very low-risk facilities may elect to use engineering controls (e.g., booths for cough-inducing
procedures, portable high-efficiency particulate [HEPA] filtration units, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation
units) in triage/waiting areas. In such situations, appropriate protocols for maintaining this equipment should
be in place, and this maintenance should be evaluated periodically.

The criteria used in clinical prediction rules will probably vary from facility to facility depending on the prevalence

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The ``very low-risk'' category generally applies only to an entire facility. A very low-risk facility is one
in which (a) patients with active TB are not admitted to inpatient areas but may receive initial assessment and diagnostic
evaluation or outpatient management in outpatient areas (e.g., ambulatory-care and emergency departments) and
(b) patients who may have active TB and need inpatient care are promptly referred to a collaborating facility. In such
facilities, the outpatient areas in which exposure to patients with active TB could occur should be assessed and assigned
to the appropriate low-, intermediate-, or high-risk category. Categorical assignment will depend on the number
of TB patients examined in the area during the preceding year and whether there is evidence of nosocomial transmission
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the area. If TB cases have been reported in the community, but no patients with active TB have been examined in the
outpatient area during the preceding year, the area can be designated as very low risk (e.g., many medical offices).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The referring and receiving facilities should establish a referral agreement to prevent inappropriate management
and potential loss to follow-up of patients suspected of having TB during evaluation in the triage system of a very
low-risk facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some facilities in which TB patients are admitted to inpatient areas, a very low-risk protocol may be appropriate
for areas (e.g., administrative areas) or occupational groups that have only a very remote possibility of exposure
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The very low-risk category may also be appropriate for outpatient facilities that do not provide initial assessment
of persons who may have TB, but do screen patients for active TB as part of a limited medical screening before undertaking
specialty care (e.g., dental settings). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Low-risk'' areas or occupational groups are those in which (a) the PPD test conversion rate is not greater
than that for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to

 (CDC, unpublished data); thus, areas in which six or more patients with active TB are examined or treated each year
(or occupational groups in which HCWs are likely to be exposed to six or more TB patients per year) should be classified
as ``intermediate risk.''

&bull;If no data or insufficient data for adequate determination of risk have been collected, such data should be
compiled, analyzed, and reviewed expeditiously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Community TB profile.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A profile of TB in the community that is served by the facility should be obtained from the public health department.
This profile should include, at a minimum, the incidence (and prevalence, if available) of active TB in the community
and the drug-susceptibility patterns of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isolates (i.e., the antituberculous agents to which each isolate is susceptible and those to which it is resistant)
from patients in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Case surveillance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Data concerning the number of suspected and confirmed active TB cases among patients and HCWs in the facility
should be systematically collected, reviewed, and used to estimate the number of TB isolation rooms needed, to recognize
possible clusters of nosocomial transmission, and to assess the level of potential occupational risk. The number
of TB patients in specific areas of a facility can be obtained from laboratory surveillance data on specimens positive
for AFB smears or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cultures, from infection-control records, and from databases containing information about hospital discharge
diagnoses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Drug-susceptibility patterns of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isolates from TB patients treated in the facility should be reviewed to identify the frequency and patterns of drug
resistance. This information may indicate a need to modify the initial treatment regimen or may suggest possible
nosocomial transmission or increased occupational risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Analysis of HCW PPD test screening data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Results of HCW PPD testing should be recorded in the individual HCW's employee health record and in a retrievable
aggregate database of all HCW PPD test results. Personal identifying information should be handled confidentially.
PPD test conversion rates should be calculated at appropriate intervals to estimate the risk for PPD test conversions
for each area of the facility and for each specific occupational group not assigned to a specific area (Table 2). To
calculate PPD test conversion rates, the total number of previously PPD-negative HCWs tested in each area or group
(i.e., the denominator) and the number of PPD test conversions among HCWs in each area or group (the numerator) must
be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PPD test conversion rates for each area or occupational group should be compared with rates for areas or groups
in which occupational exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is unlikely and with previous conversion rates in the same area or group to identify areas or groups where the risk for
occupational PPD test conversions may be increased. A low number of HCWs in a specific area may result in a greatly increased
rate of conversion for that area, although the actual risk may not be significantly greater than that for other areas.
Testing for statistical significance (e.g., Fisher's exact test or chi square test) may assist interpretation;
however, lack of statistical significance may not rule out a problem (i.e., if the number of HCWs tested is low, there
may not be adequate statistical power to detect a significant difference). Thus, interpretation of individual situations
is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An epidemiologic investigation to evaluate the likelihood of nosocomial transmission should be conducted
if PPD test conversions are noted (Section II.K.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The frequency and comprehensiveness of the HCW PPD testing program should be evaluated periodically to ensure
that all HCWs who should be included in the program are being tested at appropriate intervals. For surveillance purposes,
earlier detection of transmission may be enhanced if HCWs in a given area or occupational group are tested on different
scheduled dates rather than all being tested on the same date (Section II.J.3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Review of TB patient medical records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The medical records of a sample of TB patients examined at the facility can be reviewed periodically to evaluate
infection-control parameters (Table 1). Parameters to examine may include the intervals from date of admission
until (a) TB was suspected, (b) specimens for AFB smears were ordered, (c) these specimens were collected, (d) tests
were performed, and (e) results were reported. Moreover, the adequacy of the TB treatment regimens that were used
should be evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical record reviews should note previous hospital admissions of TB patients before the onset of TB symptoms.
Patient-to-patient transmission may be suspected if active TB occurs in a patient who had a prior hospitalization
during which exposure to another TB patient occurred or if isolates from two or more TB patients have identical characteristic
drug-susceptibility or DNA fingerprint patterns.

&bull;Data from the case review should be used to determine if there is a need to modify (a) protocols for identifying
and isolating patients who may have infectious TB, (b) laboratory procedures, (c) administrative policies and practices,
or (d) protocols for patient management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Observation of TB infection-control practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Assessing adherence to the policies of the TB infection-control program should be part of the evaluation process.
This assessment should be performed on a regular basis and whenever an increase occurs in the number of TB patients
or HCW PPD test conversions. Areas at high risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be monitored more frequently than other areas. The review of patient medical records provides information
on HCW adherence to some of the policies of the TB infection-control program. In addition, work practices related
to TB isolation (e.g., keeping doors to isolation rooms closed) should be observed to determine if employers are enforcing,
and HCWs are adhering to, these policies and if patient adherence is being enforced. If these policies are not being
enforced or adhered to, appropriate education and other corrective action should be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Engineering evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Results of engineering maintenance measures should be reviewed at regular intervals (Table 3). Data from
the most recent evaluation and from maintenance procedures and logs should be reviewed carefully as part of the risk
assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Development of the TB Infection-Control Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Based on the results of the risk assessment, a written TB infection-control plan should be developed and implemented
for each area of the facility and for each occupational group of HCWs not assigned to a specific area of the facility
(Table 2; Table 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The occurrence of drug-resistant TB in the facility or the community, or a relatively high prevalence of HIV
infection among patients or HCWs in the community, may increase the concern about transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and may influence the decision regarding which protocol to follow (i.e., a higher-risk classification may be selected).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Health-care facilities are likely to have a combination of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk areas or occupational
groups during the same time period. The appropriate protocol should be implemented for each area or group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Areas in which cough-inducing procedures are performed on patients who may have active TB should, at the minimum,
implement the intermediate-risk protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Periodic Reassessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Follow-up risk assessment should be performed at the interval indicated by the most recent risk assessment
(Figure 1; Table 2). Based on the results of the follow-up assessment, problem evaluation may need to be conducted
or the protocol may need to be modified to a higher- or lower-risk level.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;After each risk assessment, the staff responsible for TB control, in conjunction with other appropriate HCWs,
should review all TB control policies to ensure that they are effective and meet current needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Examples of Risk Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Examples of six hypothetical situations and the means by which surveillance data are used to select a TB control protocol
are described as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospital A. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.6%. No areas or HCW occupational groups have
a significantly greater PPD test conversion rate than areas or groups in which occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is unlikely (or than previous rates for the same area or group). No clusters of PPD test conversions have occurred.
Patient-to-patient transmission has not been detected. Patients who have TB are admitted to the facility, but no
area admits six or more TB patients per year. The low-risk protocol will be followed in all areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospital B. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.8%. The PPD test conversion rate for the medical
intensive-care unit rate is significantly higher than all other areas in the facility. The problem identification
process is initiated (Section II.K). It is determined that all TB patients have been isolated appropriately. Other
potential problems are then evaluated, and the cause for the higher rate is not identified. After consulting the public
health department TB infection-control program, the high-risk protocol is followed in the unit until the PPD test
conversion rate is similar to areas of the facility in which occupational exposure to TB patients is unlikely. If the
rate remains significantly higher than other areas, further evaluation, including environmental and procedural
studies, will be performed to identify possible reasons for the high conversion rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospital C. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 2.4%. Rates range from 0 to 2.6% for the individual
areas and occupational groups. None of these rates is significantly higher than rates for areas in which occupational
exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is unlikely. No particular HCW group has higher conversion rates than the other groups. No clusters of HCW PPD test
conversions have occurred. In two of the areas, HCWs cared for more than six TB patients during the preceding year.
These two areas will follow the intermediate-risk protocol, and all other areas will follow the low-risk protocol.
This hospital is located in the southeastern United States, and these conversion rates may reflect cross-reactivity
with nontuberculous mycobacteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospital D. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.2%. In no area did HCWs care for six or more TB
patients during the preceding year. Three of the 20 respiratory therapists tested had PPD conversions, for a rate
of 15%. The respiratory therapists who had PPD test conversions had spent all or part of their time in the pulmonary
function laboratory, where induced sputum specimens were obtained. A low-risk protocol is maintained for all areas
and occupational groups in the facility except for respiratory therapists. A problem evaluation is conducted in
the pulmonary function laboratory (Section II.K). It is determined that the ventilation in this area is inadequate.
Booths are installed for sputum induction. PPD testing and the risk assessment are repeated 3 months later. If the
repeat testing at 3 months indicates that no more conversions have occurred, the respiratory therapists will return
to the low-risk protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospital E. Hospital E is located in a community that has a relatively low incidence of TB. To optimize TB services in
the community, the four hospitals in the community have developed an agreement that one of them (e.g., Hospital G)
will provide all inpatient services to persons who have suspected or confirmed TB. The other hospitals have implemented
protocols in their ambulatory-care clinics and emergency departments to identify patients who may have active TB.
These patients are then transferred to Hospital G for inpatient care if such care is considered necessary. After discharge
from Hospital G, they receive follow-up care in the public health department's TB clinic. During the preceding year,
Hospital E has identified fewer than six TB patients in its ambulatory-care and emergency departments and has had
no PPD test conversions or other evidence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
transmission among HCWs or patients in these areas. These areas are classified as low risk, and all other areas are
classified as very low risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospital F. Hospital F is located in a county in which no TB cases have been reported during the preceding 2 years. A risk
assessment conducted at the facility did not identify any patients who had suspected or confirmed TB during the preceding
year. The facility is classified as minimal risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The criteria used in these protocols should be based on the prevalence and characteristics of TB in the population
served by the specific facility. These protocols should be evaluated periodically and revised according to the results
of the evaluation. Review of medical records of patients who were examined in the facility and diagnosed as having
TB may serve as a guide for developing or revising these protocols. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A diagnosis of TB may be considered for any patient who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting for "3 weeks)
or other signs or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., bloody sputum, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, or
fever). However, the index of suspicion for TB will vary in different geographic areas and will depend on the prevalence
of TB and other characteristics of the population served by the facility. The index of suspicion for TB should be very
high in geographic areas or among groups of patients in which the prevalence of TB is high (Section I.B). Appropriate
diagnostic measures should be conducted and TB precautions implemented for patients in whom active TB is suspected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Diagnostic Evaluation for Active TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Diagnostic measures for identifying TB should be conducted for patients in whom active TB is being considered.
These measures include obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination, PPD skin test, chest radiograph,
and microscopic examination and culture of sputum or other appropriate specimens (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6,34,35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Other diagnostic procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy or biopsy) may be indicated for some patients (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
36,37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prompt laboratory results are crucial to the proper treatment of the TB patient and to early initiation of infection
control. To ensure timely results, laboratories performing mycobacteriologic tests should be proficient at both
the laboratory and administrative aspects of specimen processing. Laboratories should use the most rapid methods
available (e.g., fluorescent microscopy for AFB smears; radiometric culture methods for isolation of mycobacteria;

-hydroxy-proprophenone [NAP] test, nucleic acid probes, or high-pressure liquid chromatography [HPLC] for species
identification; and radiometric methods for drug-susceptibility testing). As other more rapid or sensitive tests
become available, practical, and affordable, such tests should be incorporated promptly into the mycobacteriology
laboratory. Laboratories that rarely receive specimens for mycobacteriologic analysis should refer the specimens
to a laboratory that more frequently performs these tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Results of AFB sputum smears should be available within 24 hours of specimen collection (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
38
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The probability of TB is greater among patients who have positive PPD test results or a history of positive PPD
test results, who have previously had TB or have been exposed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or who belong to a group at high risk for TB (Section I.B). Active TB is strongly suggested if the diagnostic evaluation
reveals AFB in sputum, a chest radiograph suggestive of TB, or symptoms highly suggestive of TB. TB can occur simultaneously
in immunosuppressed persons who have pulmonary infections caused by other organisms (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pneumocystis carinii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium avium 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex) and should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of all patients who have symptoms compatible with
TB (Suppl. 1; Suppl. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;TB may be more difficult to diagnose among persons who have HIV infection (or other conditions associated with
severe suppression of cell-mediated immunity) because of a nonclassical clinical or radiographic presentation
and/or the simultaneous occurrence of other pulmonary infections (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. carinii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pneumonia and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. avium 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex). The difficulty in diagnosing TB in HIV-infected persons may be further compounded by impaired responses
to PPD skin tests (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
39,40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the possibly lower sensitivity of sputum smears for detecting AFB (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), or the overgrowth of cultures with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. avium 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex in specimens from patients infected with both

M. avium 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

M. tuberculosis

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Immunosuppressed patients who have pulmonary signs or symptoms that are ascribed initially to infections
or conditions other than TB should be evaluated initially for coexisting TB. The evaluation for TB should be repeated
if the patient does not respond to appropriate therapy for the presumed cause(s) of the pulmonary abnormalities (Suppl.
1; Suppl. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients with suspected or confirmed TB should be reported immediately to the appropriate public health department
so that standard procedures for identifying and evaluating TB contacts can be initiated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Initiation of Treatment for Suspected or Confirmed TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Patients who have confirmed active TB or who are considered highly likely to have active TB should be started
promptly on appropriate treatment in accordance with current guidelines (Suppl. 2) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). In geographic areas or facilities that have a high prevalence of MDR-TB, the initial regimen used may need to be enhanced
while the results of drug-susceptibility tests are pending. The decision should be based on analysis of surveillance
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;While the patient is in the health-care facility, anti-TB drugs should be administered by directly observed
therapy (DOT), the process by which an HCW observes the patient swallowing the medications. Continuing DOT after
the patient is discharged should be strongly considered. This decision and the arrangements for providing outpatient
DOT should be made in collaboration with the public health department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Management of Patients Who May Have Active TB in Ambulatory-Care Settings and Emergency Departments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Triage of patients in ambulatory-care settings and emergency departments should include vigorous efforts
to promptly identify patients who have active TB. HCWs who are the first points of contact in facilities that serve
populations at risk for TB should be trained to ask questions that will facilitate identification of patients with
signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of TB should be evaluated promptly to minimize the amount of time
they are in ambulatory-care areas. TB precautions should be followed while the diagnostic evaluation is being conducted
for these patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;TB precautions in the ambulatory-care setting should include (a) placing these patients in a separate area
apart from other patients, and not in open waiting areas (ideally, in a room or enclosure meeting TB isolation requirements);
(b) giving these patients surgical masks* to wear and instructing them to keep their masks on; and (c) giving these
patients tissues and instructing them to cover their mouths and noses with the tissues when coughing or sneezing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
*Surgical masks are designed to prevent the respiratory secretions of the person wearing the mask from entering the
air. When not in a TB isolation room, patients suspected of having TB should wear surgical masks to reduce the expulsion
of droplet nuclei into the air. These patients do not need to wear particulate respirators, which are designed to filter
the air before it is inhaled by the person wearing the mask. Patients suspected of having or known to have TB should never
wear a respirator that has an exhalation valve, because the device would provide no barrier to the expulsion of droplet
nuclei into the air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;TB precautions should be followed for patients who are known to have active TB and who have not completed therapy
until a determination has been made that they are noninfectious (Suppl. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients with active TB who need to attend a health-care clinic should have appointments scheduled to avoid
exposing HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocompromised persons to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This recommendation could be accomplished by designating certain times of the day for appointments for these patients
or by treating them in areas where immunocompromised persons are not treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ventilation in ambulatory-care areas where patients at high risk for TB are treated should be designed and
maintained to reduce the risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) and special areas (e.g., treatment or TB isolation rooms in ambulatory areas)
should be ventilated in the same manner as described for similar inpatient areas (Sections II.E.3, II.F; Suppl. 3).
Enhanced general ventilation or the use of air-disinfection techniques (e.g., UVGI or recirculation of air within
the room through high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filters) may be useful in general-use areas of facilities
where many infectious TB patients receive care (Section II.F; Suppl. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ideally, ambulatory-care settings in which patients with TB are frequently examined or treated should have
a TB isolation room(s) available. Such rooms are not necessary in ambulatory-care settings in which patients who
have confirmed or suspected TB are seen infrequently. However, these facilities should have a written protocol for
early identification of patients with TB symptoms and referral to an area or a collaborating facility where the patient
can be evaluated and managed appropriately. These protocols should be reviewed on a regular basis and revised as necessary.
The additional guidelines in Section II.H should be followed in ambulatory-care settings where cough-inducing
procedures are performed on patients who may have active TB.

E. Management of Hospitalized Patients Who Have Confirmed or Suspected TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Initiation of Isolation for TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;In hospitals and other inpatient facilities, any patient suspected of having or known to have infectious TB
should be placed in a TB isolation room that has currently recommended ventilation characteristics (Section II.E.3;
Suppl. 3). Written policies for initiating isolation should specify (a) the indications for isolation, (b) the person(s)
authorized to initiate and discontinue isolation, (c) the isolation practices to follow, (d) the monitoring of isolation,
(e) the management of patients who do not adhere to isolation practices, and (f) the criteria for discontinuing isolation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In rare circumstances, placing more than one TB patient together in the same room may be acceptable. This practice
is sometimes referred to as ``cohorting.'' Because of the risk for patients becoming superinfected with drug-resistant
organisms, patients with TB should be placed in the same room only if all patients involved (a) have culture-confirmed
TB, (b) have drug-susceptibility test results available on a current specimen obtained during the present hospitalization,
(c) have identical drug-susceptibility patterns on these specimens, and (d) are on effective therapy. Having isolates
with identical DNA fingerprint patterns is not adequate evidence for placing two TB patients together in the same
room, because isolates with the same DNA fingerprint pattern can have different drug-susceptibility patterns.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed TB should be evaluated for potential infectiousness according
to the same criteria as are adults (i.e., on the basis of symptoms, sputum AFB smears, radiologic findings, and other
criteria) (Suppl. 1). Children who may be infectious should be placed in isolation until they are determined to be
noninfectious. Pediatric patients who may be infectious include those who have laryngeal or extensive pulmonary
involvement, pronounced cough, positive sputum AFB smears, or cavitary TB or those for whom cough-inducing procedures
are performed (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The source of infection for a child with TB is often a member of the child's family (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Therefore, parents and other visitors of all pediatric TB patients should be evaluated for TB as soon as possible.
Until they have been evaluated, or the source case is identified, they should wear surgical masks when in areas of the
facility outside of the child's room, and they should refrain from visiting common areas in the facility (e.g., the
cafeteria or lounge areas). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;TB patients in intensive-care units should be treated the same as patients in noncritical-care settings.
They should be placed in TB isolation and have respiratory secretions submitted for AFB smear and culture if they have
undiagnosed pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If readmitted to a health-care facility, patients who are known to have active TB and who have not completed
therapy should have TB precautions applied until a determination has been made that they are noninfectious (Suppl.
1).

2. TB Isolation Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Patients who are placed in TB isolation should be educated about the mechanisms of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
transmission and the reasons for their being placed in isolation. They should be taught to cover their mouths and noses
with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, even while in the isolation room, to contain liquid drops and droplets before
they are expelled into the air (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
46
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Efforts should be made to facilitate patient adherence to isolation measures (e.g., staying in the TB isolation
room). Such efforts might include the use of incentives (e.g., providing them with telephones, televisions, or radios
in their rooms or allowing special dietary requests). Efforts should also be made to address other problems that could
interfere with adherence to isolation (e.g., management of the patient's withdrawal from addictive substances
[including tobacco]). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients placed in isolation should remain in their isolation rooms with the door closed. If possible, diagnostic
and treatment procedures should be performed in the isolation rooms to avoid transporting patients through other
areas of the facility. If patients who may have infectious TB must be transported outside their isolation rooms for
medically essential procedures that cannot be performed in the isolation rooms, they should wear surgical masks
that cover their mouths and noses during transport. Persons transporting the patients do not need to wear respiratory
protection outside the TB isolation rooms. Procedures for these patients should be scheduled at times when they can
be performed rapidly and when waiting areas are less crowded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Treatment and procedure rooms in which patients who have infectious TB or who have an undiagnosed pulmonary
disease and are at high risk for active TB receive care should meet the ventilation recommendations for isolation
rooms (Section II.E.3; Suppl. 3). Ideally, facilities in which TB patients are frequently treated should have an
area in the radiology department that is ventilated separately for TB patients. If this is not possible, TB patients
should wear surgical masks and should stay in the radiology suite the minimum amount of time possible, then be returned
promptly to their isolation rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The number of persons entering an isolation room should be minimal. All persons who enter an isolation room
should wear respiratory protection (Section II.G; Suppl. 4). The patient's visitors should be given respirators
to wear while in the isolation room, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disposable items contaminated with respiratory secretions are not associated with transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, for general infection-control purposes, these items should be handled and transported in a manner that
reduces the risk for transmitting other microorganisms to patients, HCWs, and visitors and that decreases environmental
contamination in the health-care facility. Such items should be disposed of in accordance with hospital policy and
applicable regulations (Suppl. 5).

3. The TB Isolation Room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;TB isolation rooms should be single-patient rooms with special ventilation characteristics appropriate
for the purposes of isolation (Suppl. 3). The primary purposes of TB isolation rooms are to (a) separate patients who
are likely to have infectious TB from other persons; (b) provide an environment that will allow reduction of the concentration
of droplet nuclei through various engineering methods; and (c) prevent the escape of droplet nuclei from the TB isolation
room and treatment room, thus preventing entry of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
into the corridor and other areas of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To prevent the escape of droplet nuclei, the TB isolation room should be maintained under negative pressure
(Suppl. 3). Doors to isolation rooms should be kept closed, except when patients or personnel must enter or exit the
room, so that negative pressure can be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Negative pressure in the room should be monitored daily while the room is being used for TB isolation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) recommend a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for TB isolation and treatment rooms. This ventilation rate is
based on comfort and odor control considerations. The effectiveness of this level of airflow in reducing the concentration
of droplet nuclei in the room, thus reducing the transmission of airborne pathogens, has not been evaluated directly
or adequately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ventilation rates of >6 ACH are likely to produce an incrementally greater reduction in the concentration of bacteria
in a room than are lower rates (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
50&hyph;52
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, accurate quantitation of decreases in risk that would result from specific increases in general ventilation
levels has not been performed and may not be possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of reducing the concentration of droplet nuclei, TB isolation and treatment rooms in existing health-care
facilities should have an airflow of "6 ACH. Where feasible, this airflow rate should be increased to "12 ACH by adjusting
or modifying the ventilation system or by using auxiliary means (e.g., recirculation of air through fixed HEPA filtration
systems or portable air cleaners) (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.5.a) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
53
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). New construction or renovation of existing health-care facilities should be designed so that TB isolation rooms
achieve an airflow of "12 ACH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms used to treat patients who have known or suspected infectious
TB should be exhausted to the outside in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The air
should not be recirculated into the general ventilation. In some instances, recirculation of air into the general
ventilation system from such rooms is unavoidable (i.e., in existing facilities in which the ventilation system
or facility configuration makes venting the exhaust to the outside impossible). In such cases, HEPA filters should
be installed in the exhaust duct leading from the room to the general ventilation system to remove infectious organisms
and particulates the size of droplet nuclei from the air before it is returned to the general ventilation system (Section
II.F; Suppl. 3). Air from TB isolation and treatment rooms in new or renovated facilities should not be recirculated
into the general ventilation system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Although not required, an anteroom may increase the effectiveness of the isolation room by minimizing the
potential escape of droplet nuclei into the corridor when the door is opened. To work effectively, the anteroom should
have positive air pressure in relation to the isolation room. The pressure relationship between the anteroom and
the corridor may vary according to ventilation design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Upper-room air UVGI may be used as an adjunct to general ventilation in the isolation room (Section II.F; Suppl.
3). Air in the isolation room may be recirculated within the room through HEPA filters or UVGI devices to increase the
effective ACH and to increase thermal efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Health-care facilities should have enough isolation rooms to appropriately isolate all patients who have
suspected or confirmed active TB. This number should be estimated using the results of the risk assessment of the health-care
facility. Except for minimal-and very low-risk health-care facilities, all acute-care inpatient facilities should
have at least one TB isolation room (Section II.B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Grouping isolation rooms together in one area of the facility may reduce the possibility of transmitting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to other patients and may facilitate care of TB patients and the installation and maintenance of optimal engineering
(particularly ventilation) controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Discontinuation of TB Isolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;TB isolation can be discontinued if the diagnosis of TB is ruled out. For some patients, TB can be ruled out when
another diagnosis is confirmed. If a diagnosis of TB cannot be ruled out, the patient should remain in isolation until
a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious. However, patients can be discharged from the health-care
facility while still potentially infectious if appropriate postdischarge arrangements can be ensured (Section
II.E.5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The length of time required for a TB patient to become noninfectious after starting anti-TB therapy varies
considerably (Suppl. 1). Isolation should be discontinued only when the patient is on effective therapy, is improving
clinically, and has had three consecutive negative sputum AFB smears collected on different days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hospitalized patients who have active TB should be monitored for relapse by having sputum AFB smears examined
regularly (e.g., every 2 weeks). Nonadherence to therapy (i.e., failure to take medications as prescribed) and the
presence of drug-resistant organisms are the two most common reasons why patients remain infectious despite treatment.
These reasons should be considered if a patient does not respond clinically to therapy within 2&hyph;3 weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Continued isolation throughout the hospitalization should be strongly considered for patients who have
MDR-TB because of the tendency for treatment failure or relapse (i.e., difficulty in maintaining noninfectiousness)
that has been observed in such cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Discharge Planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Before a TB patient is discharged from the health-care facility, the facility's staff and public health authorities
should collaborate to ensure continuation of therapy. Discharge planning in the health-care facility should include,
at a minimum, (a) a confirmed outpatient appointment with the provider who will manage the patient until the patient
is cured, (b) sufficient medication to take until the outpatient appointment, and (c) placement into case management
(e.g., DOT) or outreach programs of the public health department. These plans should be initiated and in place before
the patient's discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients who may be infectious at the time of discharge should only be discharged to facilities that have isolation
capability or to their homes. Plans for discharging a patient who will return home must consider whether all the household
members were infected previously and whether any uninfected household members are at very high risk for active TB
if infected (e.g., children &lt;4 years of age or persons infected with HIV or otherwise severely immunocompromised).
If the household does include such persons, arrangements should be made to prevent them from being exposed to the TB
patient until a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious.

1. General Ventilation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section deals only with engineering controls for general-use areas of health-care facilities (e.g., waiting-room
areas and emergency departments). Recommendations for engineering controls for specific areas of the facility
(e.g., TB isolation rooms) are contained in the sections encompassing those areas. Details regarding ventilation
design, evaluation, and supplemental approaches are described in Supplement 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Health-care facilities should either (a) include as part of their staff an engineer or other professional
with expertise in ventilation or (b) have this expertise available from a consultant who is an expert in ventilation
engineering and who also has hospital experience. These persons should work closely with infection-control staff
to assist in controlling airborne infections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ventilation system designs in health-care facilities should meet any applicable federal, state, and local
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The direction of airflow in health-care facilities should be designed, constructed, and maintained so that
air flows from clean areas to less-clean areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Health-care facilities serving populations that have a high prevalence of TB may need to supplement the general
ventilation or use additional engineering approaches (i.e., HEPA filtration or UVGI) in general-use areas where
TB patients are likely to go (e.g., waiting-room areas, emergency departments, and radiology suites). A single-pass,
nonrecirculating system that exhausts air to the outside, a recirculation system that passes air through HEPA filters
before recirculating it to the general ventilation system, or upper air UVGI may be used in such areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. HEPA filtration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEPA filters may be used in a number of ways to reduce or eliminate infectious droplet nuclei from room air or exhaust
(Suppl. 3). These methods include placement of HEPA filters (a) in exhaust ducts discharging air from booths or enclosures
into the surrounding room; (b) in ducts or in ceiling- or wall-mounted units, for recirculation of air within an individual
room (fixed recirculation systems); (c) in portable air cleaners; (d) in exhaust ducts to remove droplet nuclei from
air being discharged to the outside, either directly or through ventilation equipment; and (e) in ducts discharging
air from the TB isolation room into the general ventilation system. In any application, HEPA filters should be installed
carefully and maintained meticulously to ensure adequate functioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturers of in-room air cleaning equipment should provide documentation of the HEPA filter efficiency
and the efficiency of the device in lowering room air contaminant levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. UVGI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For general-use areas in which the risk for transmission of
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is relatively high, UVGI lamps may be used as an adjunct to ventilation for reducing the concentration of infectious
droplet nuclei (Suppl. 3), although the effectiveness of such units has not been evaluated adequately. Ultraviolet
(UV) units can be installed in a room or corridor to irradiate the air in the upper portion of the room (i.e., upper-room
air irradiation), or they can be installed in ducts to irradiate air passing through the ducts. UV units installed
in ducts should not be substituted for HEPA filters in ducts that discharge air from TB isolation rooms into the general
ventilation system. However, UV units can be used in ducts that recirculate air back into the same room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To function properly and decrease hazards to HCWs and others in the health-care facility, UV lamps should be installed
properly and maintained adequately, which includes the monitoring of irradiance levels. UV tubes should be changed
according to the manufacturer's instructions or when meter readings indicate tube failure. An employee trained
in the use and handling of UV lamps should be responsible for these measures and for keeping maintenance records. Applicable
safety guidelines should be followed. Caution should be exercised to protect HCWs, patients, visitors, and others
from excessive exposure to UV radiation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Personal respiratory protection should be used by (a) persons entering rooms in which patients with known
or suspected infectious TB are being isolated, (b) persons present during cough-inducing or aerosol-generating
procedures performed on such patients, and (c) persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls
are not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei (Suppl. 4). These other settings
include transporting patients who may have infectious TB in emergency transport vehicles and providing urgent surgical
or dental care to patients who may have infectious TB before a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious
(Suppl. 1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
should meet the following standard performance criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The ability to filter particles 1 &mu;m in size in the unloaded* state with a filter efficiency of "95% (i.e., filter
leakage of &gt;5%), given flow rates of up to 50 L per minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
*Some filters become more efficient as they become loaded with dust. Health-care settings do not have enough dust
in the air to load a filter on a respirator. Therefore, the filter efficiency for respirators used in health-care settings
must be determined in the unloaded state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively fit tested in a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of &gt;10%
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
54,55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The ability to fit the different facial sizes and characteristics of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the
respirators available in at least three sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in accordance with standards established by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) and good industrial hygiene practice, by HCWs each time they put on their respirators
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited number of selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed
on patients suspected of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having had active TB at the
time of death) where the estimated risk for transmission of
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be such that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard performance criteria is appropriate. In
such circumstances, a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria and compatible with patient-care
delivery (e.g., more protective negative-pressure respirators; powered air-purifying particulate respirators
[PAPRs]; or positive-pressure air-line, half-mask respirators) should be provided by employers to HCWs who are
exposed to
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information on these and other respirators is in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and in Supplement 4 of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In some settings, HCWs may be at risk for two types of exposure: (a) inhalation of
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (b) mucous membrane exposure to fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In these settings, protection
against both types of exposure should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may
have infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW should serve two functions: (a) It should protect the surgical
field from the respiratory secretions of the HCW, and (b) it should protect the HCW from infectious droplet nuclei
that may be expelled by the patient or generated by the procedure. Respirators with exhalation valves and most positive-pressure
respirators do not protect the sterile field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Health-care facilities in which respiratory protection is used to prevent inhalation of
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are required by OSHA to develop, implement, and maintain a respiratory protection program (Suppl. 4). All HCWs who
use respiratory protection should be included in this program. Visitors to TB patients should be given respirators
to wear while in isolation rooms, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Facilities that do not have isolation rooms and do not perform cough-inducing procedures on patients who may
have TB may not need to have a respiratory protection program for TB. However, such facilities should have written
protocols for the early identification of patients who have signs or symptoms of TB and procedures for referring these
patients to a facility where they can be evaluated and managed appropriately. These protocols should be evaluated
regularly and revised as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Surgical masks are designed to prevent the respiratory secretions of the person wearing the mask from entering
the air. To reduce the expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air, patients suspected of having TB should wear surgical
masks when not in TB isolation rooms. These patients do not need to wear particulate respirators, which are designed
to filter the air before it is inhaled by the person wearing the respirator. Patients suspected of having or known to
have TB should never wear a respirator that has an exhalation valve, because this type of respirator does not prevent
expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air.

H. Cough-Inducing and Aerosol-Generating Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. General Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures that involve instrumentation of the lower respiratory tract or induce coughing can increase the likelihood
of droplet nuclei being expelled into the air. These cough-inducing procedures include endotracheal intubation
and suctioning, diagnostic sputum induction, aerosol treatments (e.g., pentamidine therapy), and bronchoscopy.
Other procedures that can generate aerosols (e.g., irrigation of tuberculous abscesses, homogenizing or lyophilizing
tissue, or other processing of tissue that may contain tubercle bacilli) are also covered by these recommendations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull; Cough-inducing procedures should not be performed on patients who may have infectious TB unless the procedures
are absolutely necessary and can be performed with appropriate precautions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All cough-inducing procedures performed on patients who may have infectious TB should be performed using
local exhaust ventilation devices (e.g., booths or special enclosures) or, if this is not feasible, in a room that
meets the ventilation requirements for TB isolation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs should wear respiratory protection when present in rooms or enclosures in which cough-inducing procedures
are being performed on patients who may have infectious TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After completion of cough-inducing procedures, patients who may have infectious TB should remain in their
isolation rooms or enclosures and not return to common waiting areas until coughing subsides. They should be given
tissues and instructed to cover their mouths and noses with the tissues when coughing. If TB patients must recover
from sedatives or anesthesia after a procedure (e.g, after a bronchoscopy), they should be placed in separate isolation
rooms (and not in recovery rooms with other patients) while they are being monitored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Before the booth, enclosure, or room is used for another patient, enough time should be allowed to pass for at
least 99% of airborne contaminants to be removed. This time will vary according to the efficiency of the ventilation
or filtration used (Suppl. 3, Table S3&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;If performing bronchoscopy in positive-pressure rooms (e.g., operating rooms) is unavoidable, TB should
be ruled out as a diagnosis before the procedure is performed. If the bronchoscopy is being performed for the purpose
of diagnosing pulmonary disease and that diagnosis could include TB, the procedure should be performed in a room that
meets TB isolation ventilation requirements.

&bull;Patients should be screened for active TB before prophylactic therapy with aerosolized pentamidine is initiated.
Screening should include obtaining a medical history and performing skin testing and chest radiography. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Before each subsequent treatment with aerosolized pentamidine, patients should be screened for symptoms
suggestive of TB (e.g., development of a productive cough). If such symptoms are elicited, a diagnostic evaluation
for TB should be initiated.

I. Education and Training of HCWs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All HCWs, including physicians, should receive education regarding TB that is relevant to persons in their particular
occupational group. Ideally, training should be conducted before initial assignment, and the need for additional
training should be reevaluated periodically (e.g., once a year). The level and detail of this education will vary
according to the HCW's work responsibilities and the level of risk in the facility (or area of the facility) in which
the HCW works. However, the program may include the following elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 including information concerning the hierarchy of TB infection-control measures and the written policies and procedures
of the facility. Site-specific control measures should be provided to HCWs working in areas that require control

J. HCW Counseling, Screening, and Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A TB counseling, screening, and prevention program for HCWs should be established to protect both HCWs and patients.
HCWs who have positive PPD test results, PPD test conversions, or symptoms suggestive of TB should be identified,
evaluated to rule out a diagnosis of active TB, and started on therapy or preventive therapy if indicated (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). In addition, the results of the HCW PPD screening program will contribute to evaluation of the effectiveness of
current infection-control practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Counseling HCWs Regarding TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Because of the increased risk for rapid progression from latent TB infection to active TB in HIV-infected or
otherwise severely immunocompromised persons, all HCWs should know if they have a medical condition or are receiving
a medical treatment that may lead to severely impaired cell-mediated immunity. HCWs who may be at risk for HIV infection
should know their HIV status (i.e., they should be encouraged to voluntarily seek counseling and testing for HIV antibody
status). Existing guidelines for counseling and testing should be followed routinely (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
56
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Knowledge of these conditions allows the HCW to seek the appropriate preventive measures outlined in this document
and to consider voluntary work reassignments. Of particular importance is that HCWs need to know their HIV status
if they are at risk for HIV infection and they work in settings where patients who have drug-resistant TB may be encountered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All HCWs should be informed about the need to follow existing recommendations for infection control to minimize
the risk for exposure to infectious agents; implementation of these recommendations will greatly reduce the risk
for occupational infections among HCWs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
57
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All HCWs should also be informed about the potential risks to severely immunocompromised persons associated with
caring for patients who have some infectious diseases, including TB. It should be emphasized that limiting exposure
to TB patients is the most protective measure that severely immunosuppressed HCWs can take to avoid becoming infected
with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. HCWs who have severely impaired cell-mediated immunity and who may be exposed to
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may consider a change in job setting to avoid such exposure. HCWs should be advised of the option that severely immunocompromised
HCWs can choose to transfer voluntarily to areas and work activities in which there is the lowest possible risk for
exposure to
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This choice should be a personal decision for HCWs after they have been informed of the risks to their health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Employers should make reasonable accommodations (e.g., alternative job assignments) for employees who
have a health condition that compromises cell-mediated immunity and who work in settings where they may be exposed
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. HCWs who are known to be immunocompromised should be referred to employee health professionals who can individually
counsel the employees regarding their risk for TB. Upon the request of the immunocompromised HCW, employers should
offer, but not compel, a work setting in which the HCW would have the lowest possible risk for occupational exposure
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Evaluation of these situations should also include consideration of the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities
Act of 1990* and other applicable federal, state, and local laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;All HCWs should be informed that immunosuppressed HCWs should have appropriate follow-up and screening for
infectious diseases, including TB, provided by their medical practitioner. HCWs who are known to be HIV-infected
or otherwise severely immunosuppressed should be tested for cutaneous anergy at the time of PPD testing (Suppl. 2).
Consideration should be given to retesting, at least every 6 months, those immunocompromised HCWs who are potentially
exposed to
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because of the high risk for rapid progression to active TB if they become infected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information provided by HCWs regarding their immune status should be treated confidentially. If the HCW requests
voluntary job reassignment, the confidentiality of the HCW should be maintained. Facilities should have written
procedures on confidential handling of such information.

2. Screening HCWs for Active TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other signs
or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, or fever), should
be evaluated promptly for TB. The HCW should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded or
until the HCW is on therapy and a determination has been made that the HCW is noninfectious.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The risk assessment should identify which HCWs have potential for exposure to
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the frequency with which the exposure may occur. This information is used to determine which HCWs to include in
the skin-testing program and the frequency with which they should be tested (Table 2).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;If HCWs are from risks groups with increased prevalence of TB, consideration may be given to including them
in the skin-testing program, even if they do not have potential occupational exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, so that converters can be identified and preventive therapy offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Administrators of health-care facilities should ensure that physicians and other personnel not paid by,
but working in, the facility receive skin testing at appropriate intervals for their occupational group and work
location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;During the pre-employment physical or when applying for hospital privileges, HCWs who have potential for
exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Table 2), including those with a history of BCG vaccination, should have baseline PPD skin testing performed (Suppl.
2). For HCWs who have not had a documented negative PPD test result during the preceding 12 months, the baseline PPD
testing should employ the two-step method; this will detect boosting phenomena that might be misinterpreted as a
skin-test conversion. Decisions concerning the use of the two-step procedure for baseline testing in a particular
facility should be based on the frequency of boosting in that facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs who have a documented history of a positive PPD test, adequate treatment for disease, or adequate preventive
therapy for infection, should be exempt from further PPD screening unless they develop signs or symptoms suggestive
of TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PPD-negative HCWs should undergo repeat PPD testing at regular intervals as determined by the risk assessment
(Section II.B). In addition, these HCWs should be tested whenever they have been exposed to a TB patient and appropriate
precautions were not observed at the time of exposure (Section II.K.3). Performing PPD testing of HCWs who work in
the same area or occupational group on different scheduled dates (e.g., test them on their birthdays or on their employment
anniversary dates), rather than testing all HCWs in the area or group on the same day, may lead to earlier detection
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All PPD tests should be administered, read, and interpreted in accordance with current guidelines by specified
trained personnel (Suppl. 2). At the time their test results are read, HCWs should be informed about the interpretation
of both positive and negative PPD test results. This information should indicate that the interpretation of an induration
that is 5&hyph;9 mm in diameter depends on the HCW's immune status and history of exposure to persons who have infectious
TB. Specifically, HCWs who have indurations of 5&hyph;9 mm in diameter should be advised that such results may be considered
positive for HCWs who are contacts of persons with infectious TB or who have HIV infection or other causes of severe
immunosuppression (e.g., immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When an HCW who is not assigned regularly to a single work area has a PPD test conversion, appropriate personnel
should identify the areas where the HCW worked during the time when infection was likely to have occurred. This information
can then be considered in analyzing the risk for transmission in those areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In any area of the facility where transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is known to have occurred, a problem evaluation should be conducted (Section II.K), and the frequency of skin testing
should be determined according to the applicable risk category (Section II.B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PPD test results should be recorded confidentially in the individual HCW's employee health record and in an
aggregate database of all HCW PPD test results. The database can be analyzed periodically to estimate the risk for
acquiring new infection in specific areas or occupational groups in the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Evaluation and Management of HCWs Who Have Positive PPD Test Results or Active TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All HCWs with newly recognized positive PPD test results or PPD test conversions should be evaluated promptly
for active TB. This evaluation should include a clinical examination and a chest radiograph. If the history, clinical
examination, or chest radiograph is compatible with active TB, additional tests should be performed (Section II.C.2).
If symptoms compatible with TB are present, the HCW should be excluded from the workplace until either a) a diagnosis
of active TB is ruled out or b) a diagnosis of active TB was established, the HCW is being treated, and a determination
has been made that the HCW is noninfectious (Suppl. 2). HCWs who do not have active TB should be evaluated for preventive
therapy according to published guidelines (Suppl. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If an HCW's PPD test result converts to positive, a history of confirmed or suspected TB exposure should be obtained
in an attempt to determine the potential source. When the source of exposure is known, the drug-susceptibility pattern
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isolated from the source should be identified so that the correct curative or preventive therapy can be initiated
for the HCW with the PPD test conversion. The drug-susceptibility pattern should be recorded in the HCW's medical
record, where it will be available if the HCW subsequently develops active TB and needs therapy specific for the drug-susceptibility
pattern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All HCWs, including those with histories of positive PPD test results, should be reminded periodically about
the symptoms of TB and the need for prompt evaluation of any pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Routine and follow-up chest radiographs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Routine chest radiographs are not required for asymptomatic, PPD-negative HCWs. HCWs with positive PPD test
results should have a chest radiograph as part of the initial evaluation of their PPD test; if negative, repeat chest
radiographs are not needed unless symptoms develop that could be attributed to TB (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
58
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, more frequent monitoring for symptoms of TB may be considered for recent converters and other PPD-positive
HCWs who are at increased risk for developing active TB (e.g., HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocompromised
HCWs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Workplace restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Active TB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs with pulmonary or laryngeal TB pose a risk to patients and other HCWs while they are infectious, and they
should be excluded from the workplace until they are noninfectious. The same work restrictions apply to all HCWs regardless
of their immune status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Before the HCW who has TB can return to the workplace, the health-care facility should have documentation from
the HCW's health-care provider that the HCW is receiving adequate therapy, the cough has resolved, and the HCW has
had three consecutive negative sputum smears collected on different days. After work duties are resumed and while
the HCW remains on anti-TB therapy, facility staff should receive periodic documentation from the HCW's health-care
provider that the HCW is being maintained on effective drug therapy for the recommended time period and that the sputum
AFB smears continue to be negative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs with active laryngeal or pulmonary TB who discontinue treatment before they are cured should be evaluated
promptly for infectiousness. If the evaluation determines that they are still infectious, they should be excluded
from the workplace until treatment has been resumed, an adequate response to therapy has been documented, and three
more consecutive sputum AFB smears collected on different days have been negative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs who have TB at sites other than the lung or larynx usually do not need to be excluded from the workplace if
a diagnosis of concurrent pulmonary TB has been ruled out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Latent TB infection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs receiving preventive treatment for latent TB infection should not be restricted from their usual work
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs with latent TB infection who cannot take or who do not accept or complete a full course of preventive therapy
should not be excluded from the workplace. These HCWs should be counseled about the risk for developing active TB and
instructed regularly to seek prompt evaluation if signs or symptoms develop that could be caused by TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
K. Problem Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Epidemiologic investigations may be indicated for several situations. These include, but are not limited to, (a)
the occurrence of PPD test conversions or active TB in HCWs; (b) the occurrence of possible person-to-person transmission
of M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; and (c) situations in which patients or HCWs with active TB are not promptly identified and isolated, thus exposing
other persons in the facility to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The general objectives of the epidemiologic investigations in these situations are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To determine the likelihood that transmission of and infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has occurred in the facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To determine the extent to which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been transmitted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To identify those persons who have been exposed and infected, enabling them to receive appropriate clinical management;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To identify factors that could have contributed to transmission and infection and to implement appropriate interventions;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) To evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions that are implemented and to ensure that exposure to and transmission
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 have been terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exact circumstances of these situations are likely to vary considerably, and the associated epidemiologic investigations
should be tailored to the individual circumstances. The following sections provide general guidance for conducting
these investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Investigating PPD Test Conversions and Active TB in HCWs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Investigating PPD test conversions in HCWs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPD test conversions may be detected in HCWs as a result of a contact investigation, in which case the probable source
of exposure and transmission is already known (Section II.K.3.), or as a result of routine screening, in which case
the probable source of exposure and infection is not already known and may not be immediately apparent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a skin-test conversion in an HCW is identified as part of routine screening, the following steps should be considered
(Figure 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The HCW should be evaluated promptly for active TB. The initial evaluation should include a thorough history,
physical examination, and chest radiograph. On the basis of the initial evaluation, other diagnostic procedures
(e.g., sputum examination) may be indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If appropriate, the HCW should be placed on preventive or curative therapy in accordance with current guidelines
(Suppl. 2) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A history of possible exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be obtained from the HCW to determine the most likely source of infection. When the source of infection is known,
the drug-susceptibility pattern of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isolate from the source patient should be identified to determine appropriate preventive or curative therapy regimens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
outside the facility, no further epidemiologic investigation to identify a source in the facility is necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the history does not suggest that the HCW was exposed and infected outside the facility but does identify
a probable source of exposure in the facility, contacts of the suspected source patient should be identified and evaluated.
Possible reasons for the exposure and transmission should be evaluated (Table 4), interventions should be implemented
to correct these causes, and PPD testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be performed immediately and repeated after
3 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no additional PPD test conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the investigation can be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If additional PPD test conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the possible reasons for exposure and transmission
should be reassessed, the appropriateness of and degree of adherence to the interventions implemented should be
evaluated, and PPD testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after another 3 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no additional PPD test conversions are detected on the second round of follow-up testing, the investigation can
be terminated. However, if additional PPD conversions are detected on the second round of follow-up testing, a high-risk
protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational group, and the public health department or other
persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the history does not suggest that the HCW was exposed to and infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
outside the facility and does not identify a probable source of exposure in the facility, further investigation to
identify the probable source patient in the facility is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interval during which the HCW could have been infected should be estimated. Generally, this would be the interval
from 10 weeks before the most recent negative PPD test through 2 weeks before the first positive PPD test (i.e., the
conversion). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory and infection-control records should be reviewed to identify all patients or HCWs who have suspected
or confirmed infectious TB and who could have transmitted 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to the HCW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this process does identify a likely source patient, contacts of the suspected source patient should be identified
and evaluated, and possible reasons for the exposure and transmission should be evaluated (Table 4). Interventions
should be implemented to correct these causes, and PPD testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after 3 months.
However, if this process does not identify a probable source case, PPD screening results of other HCWs in the same area
or occupational group should be reviewed for additional evidence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
transmission. If sufficient additional PPD screening results are not available, appropriate personnel should
consider conducting additional PPD screening of other HCWs in the same area or occupational group.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
If this review and/or screening does not identify additional PPD conversions, nosocomial transmission is less likely,
and the contact investigation can probably be terminated. Whether the HCW's PPD test conversion resulted from occupational
exposure and infection is uncertain; however, the absence of other data implicating nosocomial transmission suggests
that the conversion could have resulted from (a) unrecognized exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
outside the facility; (b) cross-reactivity with another antigen (e.g., nontuberculous mycobacteria); (c) errors
in applying, reading, or interpreting the test; (d) false positivity caused by the normal variability of the test;
or (e) false positivity caused by a defective PPD preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this review and/or screening does identify additional PPD test conversions, nosocomial transmission is more
likely. In this situation, the patient identification (i.e., triage) process, TB infection-control policies and
practices, and engineering controls should be evaluated to identify problems that could have led to exposure and
transmission (Table 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no such problems are identified, a high-risk protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational
group, and the public health department or other persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such problems are identified, appropriate interventions should be implemented to correct the problem(s), and
PPD skin testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after 3 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no additional PPD conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the investigation can be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If additional PPD conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the possible reasons for exposure and transmission
should be reassessed, the appropriateness of and adherence to the interventions implemented should be evaluated,
and PPD skin testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after another 3 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no additional PPD test conversions are detected on this second round of follow-up testing, the investigation can
be terminated. However, if additional PPD test conversions are detected on the second round of follow-up testing,
a high-risk protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational group, and the public health department
or other persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Investigating cases of active TB in HCWs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an HCW develops active TB, the following steps should be taken: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The case should be evaluated epidemiologically, in a manner similar to PPD test conversions in HCWs, to determine
the likelihood that it resulted from occupational transmission and to identify possible causes and implement appropriate
interventions if the evaluation suggests such transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Contacts of the HCW (e.g., other HCWs, patients, visitors, and others who have had intense exposure to the HCW)
should be identified and evaluated for TB infection and disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2). The public health department
should be notified immediately for consultation and to allow for investigation of community contacts who were not
exposed in the health-care facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The public health department should notify facilities when HCWs with TB are reported by physicians so that
an investigation of contacts can be conducted in the facility. The information provided by the health department
to facilities should be in accordance with state or local laws to protect the confidentiality of the HCW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Investigating Possible Patient-to-Patient Transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Surveillance of active TB cases in patients should be conducted. If this surveillance suggests the possibility of
patient-to-patient transmission of M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(e.g., a high proportion of TB patients had prior admissions during the year preceding onset of their TB, the number
of patients with drug-resistant TB increased suddenly, or isolates obtained from multiple patients had identical
and characteristic drug-susceptibility or DNA fingerprint patterns), the following steps should be taken: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Review the HCW PPD test results and patient surveillance data for the suspected areas to detect additional
patients or HCWs with PPD test conversions or active disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Look for possible exposures that patients with newly diagnosed TB could have had to other TB patients during
previous admissions. For example, were the patients admitted to the same room or area, or did they receive the same
procedure or go to the same treatment area on the same day? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the evaluation thus far suggests transmission has occurred, the following steps should be taken: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Evaluate possible causes of the transmission (e.g., problem with patient detection, institutional barriers
to implementing appropriate isolation practices, or inadequate engineering controls) (Table 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ascertain whether other patients or HCWs could have been exposed; if so, evaluate these persons for TB infection
and disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Notify the public health department so they can begin a community contact investigation if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Investigating Contacts of Patients and HCWs Who Have Infectious TB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a patient who has active TB is examined in a health-care facility and the illness is not diagnosed correctly, resulting
in failure to apply appropriate precautions, or if an HCW develops active TB and exposes other persons in the facility,
the following steps should be taken when the illness is later diagnosed correctly: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To identify other patients and HCWs who were exposed to the source patient before isolation procedures were
begun, interview the source patient and all applicable personnel and review that patient's medical record. Determine
the areas of the facility in which the source patient was hospitalized, visited, or worked before being placed in isolation
(e.g., outpatient clinics, hospital rooms, treatment rooms, radiology and procedure areas, and patient lounges)
and the HCWs who may have been exposed during that time (e.g., persons providing direct care, therapists, clerks,
transportation personnel, housekeepers, and social workers). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The contact investigation should first determine if 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transmission has occurred from the source patient to those persons with whom the source patient had the most intense
contact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Administer PPD tests to the most intensely exposed HCWs and patients as soon as possible after the exposure
has occurred. If transmission did occur to the most intensely exposed persons, then those persons with whom the patient
had less contact should be evaluated. If the initial PPD test result is negative, a second test should be administered
12 weeks after the exposure was terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Those persons who were exposed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and who have either a PPD test conversion or symptoms suggestive of TB should receive prompt clinical evaluation and,
if indicated, chest radiographs and bacteriologic studies should be performed (Suppl. 2). Those persons who have
evidence of newly acquired infection or active disease should be evaluated for preventive or curative therapy (Suppl.
2). Persons who have previously had positive PPD test results and who have been exposed to an infectious TB patient
do not require a repeat PPD test or a chest radiograph unless they have symptoms suggestive of TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In addition to PPD testing those HCWs and patients who have been exposed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because a patient was not isolated promptly or an HCW with active TB was not identified promptly, the investigation
should determine why the diagnosis of TB was delayed. If the correct diagnosis was made but the patient was not isolated
promptly, the reasons for the delay need to be defined so that corrective actions can be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Coordination With the Public Health Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;As soon as a patient or HCW is known or suspected to have active TB, the patient or HCW should be reported to the
public health department so that appropriate follow-up can be arranged and a community contact investigation can
be performed. The health department should be notified well before patient discharge to facilitate follow-up and
continuation of therapy. A discharge plan coordinated with the patient or HCW, the health department, and the inpatient
facility should be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The public health department should protect the confidentiality of the patient or HCW in accordance with state
and local laws.

&bull;Health-care facilities and health departments should coordinate their efforts to perform appropriate contact
investigations on patients and HCWs who have active TB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;The public health department may be able to assist facilities with planning and implementing various aspects
of a TB infection-control program (e.g., surveillance, screening activities, and outbreak investigations). In
addition, the state health department may be able to provide names of experts to assist with the engineering aspects
of TB infection control.

M. Additional Considerations for Selected Areas in Health-Care Facilities and Other Health-Care Settings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains additional information for selected areas in health-care facilities and for other health-care
settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Selected Areas in Health-Care Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Operating rooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Elective operative procedures on patients who have TB should be delayed until the patient is no longer infectious.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If operative procedures must be performed, they should be done, if possible, in operating rooms that have anterooms.
For operating rooms without anterooms, the doors to the operating room should be closed, and traffic into and out of
the room should be minimal to reduce the frequency of opening and closing the door. Attempts should be made to perform
the procedure at a time when other patients are not present in the operative suite and when a minimum number of personnel
are present (e.g., at the end of day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Placing a bacterial filter on the patient endotracheal tube (or at the expiratory side of the breathing circuit
of a ventilator or anesthesia machine if these are used) when operating on a patient who has confirmed or suspected
TB may help reduce the risk for contaminating anesthesia equipment or discharging tubercle bacilli into the ambient
air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;During postoperative recovery, the patient should be monitored and should be placed in a private room that
meets recommended standards for ventilating TB isolation rooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may
have infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW must protect the field from the respiratory secretions
of the HCW and protect the HCW from the infectious droplet nuclei generated by the patient. Valved or positive-pressure
respirators do not protect the sterile field; therefore, a respirator that does not have a valve and that meets the
criteria in Section II.G should be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Autopsy rooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because infectious aerosols are likely to be present in autopsy rooms, such areas should be at negative pressure
with respect to adjacent areas (Suppl. 3), and the room air should be exhausted directly to the outside of the building.
ASHRAE recommends that autopsy rooms have ventilation that provides an airflow of 12 ACH (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), although the effectiveness of this ventilation level in reducing the risk for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TB precautions may be appropriate in a number of other types of health care settings. The specific precautions that
are applied will vary depending on the setting. At a minimum, a risk assessment should be performed yearly for these
settings; a written TB infection-control plan should be developed, evaluated, and revised on a regular basis; protocols
should be in place for identifying and managing patients who may have active TB; HCWs should receive appropriate training,
education, and screening; protocols for problem evaluation should be in place; and coordination with the public
health department should be arranged when necessary. Other recommendations specific to certain of these settings
follow.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When EMS personnel or others must transport patients who have confirmed or suspected active TB, a surgical
mask should be placed, if possible, over the patient's mouth and nose. Because administrative and engineering controls
during emergency transport situations cannot be ensured, EMS personnel should wear respiratory protection when
transporting such patients. If feasible, the windows of the vehicle should be kept open. The heating and air-conditioning
system should be set on a nonrecirculating cycle.

e. Dental settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the symptoms for which patients seek treatment in a dental-care setting are not likely to be caused by infectious
TB. Unless a patient requiring dental care coincidentally has TB, it is unlikely that infectious TB will be encountered
in the dental setting. Furthermore, generation of droplet nuclei containing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
during dental procedures has not been demonstrated (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
62
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Therefore, the risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in most dental settings is probably quite low. Nevertheless, during dental procedures, patients and dental workers
share the same air for varying periods of time. Coughing may be stimulated occasionally by oral manipulations, although
no specific dental procedures have been classified as ``cough-inducing.'' In some instances, the population served
by a dental-care facility, or the HCWs in the facility, may be at relatively high risk for TB. Because the potential
exists for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in dental settings, the following recommendations should be followed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A risk assessment (Section II.B) should be done periodically, and TB infection-control policies for each
dental setting should be based on the risk assessment. The policies should include provisions for detection and referral
of patients who may have undiagnosed active TB; management of patients with active TB, relative to provision of urgent
dental care; and employer-sponsored HCW education, counseling, and screening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;While taking patients' initial medical histories and at periodic updates, dental HCWs should routinely ask
all patients whether they have a history of TB disease and symptoms suggestive of TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients with a medical history or symptoms suggestive of undiagnosed active TB should be referred promptly
for medical evaluation of possible infectiousness. Such patients should not remain in the dental-care facility
any longer than required to arrange a referral. While in the dental-care facility, they should wear surgical masks
and should be instructed to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Elective dental treatment should be deferred until a physician confirms that the patient does not have infectious
TB. If the patient is diagnosed as having active TB, elective dental treatment should be deferred until the patient
is no longer infectious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If urgent dental care must be provided for a patient who has, or is strongly suspected of having, infectious
TB, such care should be provided in facilities that can provide TB isolation (Sections II.E and G). Dental HCWs should
use respiratory protection while performing procedures on such patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any dental HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other
signs or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, and fever),
should be evaluated promptly for TB. The HCW should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded
or until the HCW is on therapy and a determination has been made that the HCW is noninfectious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In dental-care facilities that provide care to populations at high risk for active TB, it may be appropriate
to use engineering controls similar to those used in general-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) of medical facilities
that have a similar risk profile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Home-health-care settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs who provide medical services in the homes of patients who have suspected or confirmed infectious TB should
instruct such patients to cover their mouths and noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Until such patients
are no longer infectious, HCWs should wear respiratory protection when entering these patients' homes (Suppl. 4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Precautions in the home may be discontinued when the patient is no longer infectious (Suppl. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs who provide health-care services in their patients' homes can assist in preventing transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Cough-inducing procedures performed on patients who have infectious TB should not be done in the patients'
homes unless absolutely necessary. When medically necessary cough-inducing procedures (e.g., AFB sputum collection
for evaluation of therapy) must be performed on patients who may have infectious TB, the procedures should be performed
in a health-care facility in a room or booth that has the recommended ventilation for such procedures. If these procedures
must be performed in a patient's home, they should be performed in a well-ventilated area away from other household
members. If feasible, the HCW should consider opening a window to improve ventilation or collecting the specimen
while outside the dwelling. The HCW collecting these specimens should wear respiratory protection during the procedure
(Section II.G). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs who provide medical services in their patients' homes should be included in comprehensive employer-sponsored
TB training, education, counseling, and screening programs. These programs should include provisions for identifying
HCWs who have active TB, baseline PPD skin testing, and follow-up PPD testing at intervals appropriate to the degree
of risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients who are at risk for developing active TB and the HCWs who provide medical services in the homes of such
patients should be reminded periodically of the importance of having pulmonary symptoms evaluated promptly to permit
early detection of and treatment for TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Medical offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the symptoms of active TB are symptoms for which patients are likely to seek treatment in a medical office.
Furthermore, the populations served by some medical offices, or the HCWs in the office, may be at relatively high risk
for TB. Thus, it is likely that infectious TB will be encountered in a medical office. Because of the potential for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transmission, the following recommendations should be observed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A risk assessment should be conducted periodically, and TB infection-control policies based on results of
the risk assessment should be developed for the medical office. The policies should include provisions for identifying
and managing patients who may have undiagnosed active TB; managing patients who have active TB; and educating, training,
counseling, and screening HCWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;While taking patients' initial medical histories and at periodic updates, HCWs who work in medical offices
should routinely ask all patients whether they have a history of TB disease or have had symptoms suggestive of TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients with a medical history and symptoms suggestive of active TB should receive an appropriate diagnostic
evaluation for TB and be evaluated promptly for possible infectiousness. Ideally, this evaluation should be done
in a facility that has TB isolation capability. At a minimum, the patient should be provided with and asked to wear a
surgical mask, instructed to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and separated as much
as possible from other patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical offices that provide evaluation or treatment services for TB patients should follow the recommendations
for managing patients in ambulatory-care settings (Section II.D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If cough-inducing procedures are to be administered in a medical office to patients who may have active TB,
appropriate precautions should be followed (Section II.H). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other signs
or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, or fever) should
be evaluated promptly for TB. HCWs with such signs or symptoms should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis
of TB has been excluded or until they are on therapy and a determination has been made that they are noninfectious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCWs who work in medical offices in which there is a likelihood of exposure to patients who have infectious TB
should be included in employer-sponsored education, training, counseling, and PPD testing programs appropriate
to the level of risk in the office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In medical offices that provide care to populations at relatively high risk for active TB, use of engineering
controls as described in this document for general-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) may be appropriate (Section II.F;

Supplement 1: Determining the Infectiousness of a TB Patient
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The infectiousness of patients with TB correlates with the number of organisms expelled into the air, which, in turn,
correlates with the following factors: (a) Disease in the lungs, airways, or larynx; (b) presence of cough or other
forceful expiratory measures; (c) presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the sputum; (d) failure of the patient to
cover the mouth and nose when coughing; (e) presence of cavitation on chest radiograph; (f) inappropriate or short
duration of chemotherapy; and (g) administration of procedures that can induce coughing or cause aerosolization
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(e.g., sputum induction).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most infectious persons are most likely those who have not been treated for TB and who have either (a) pulmonary
or laryngeal TB and a cough or are undergoing cough-inducing procedures, (b) a positive AFB sputum smear, or (c) cavitation
on chest radiograph. Persons with extrapulmonary TB usually are not infectious unless they have (a) concomitant
pulmonary disease; (b) nonpulmonary disease located in the respiratory tract or oral cavity; or (c) extrapulmonary
disease that includes an open abscess or lesion in which the concentration of organisms is high, especially if drainage
from the abscess or lesion is extensive (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
20,22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Coinfection with HIV does not appear to affect the infectiousness of TB patients (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
63&hyph;65
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, children who have TB may be less likely than adults to be infectious; however, transmission from children
can occur. Therefore, children with TB should be evaluated for infectiousness using the same parameters as for adults
(i.e., pulmonary or laryngeal TB, presence of cough or cough-inducing procedures, positive sputum AFB smear, cavitation
on chest radiograph, and adequacy and duration of therapy). Pediatric patients who may be infectious include those
who (a) are not on therapy, (b) have just been started on therapy, or (c) are on inadequate therapy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
who (a) have laryngeal or extensive pulmonary involvement, (b) have pronounced cough or are undergoing cough-inducing
procedures, (c) have positive sputum AFB smears, or (d) have cavitary TB. Children who have typical primary tuberculous
lesions and do not have any of the indicators of infectiousness listed previously usually do not need to be placed in
isolation. Because the source case for pediatric TB patients often occurs in a member of the infected child's family
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), parents and other visitors of all pediatric TB patients should be evaluated for TB as soon as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infection is most likely to result from exposure to persons who have unsuspected pulmonary TB and are not receiving
anti-TB therapy or from persons who have diagnosed TB and are not receiving adequate therapy. Administration of effective
anti-TB therapy has been associated with decreased infectiousness among persons who have active TB (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
66
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Effective therapy reduces coughing, the amount of sputum produced, and the number of organisms in the sputum. However,
the period of time a patient must take effective therapy before becoming noninfectious varies between patients (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
67
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). For example, some TB patients are never infectious, whereas those with unrecognized or inadequately treated drug-resistant
TB may remain infectious for weeks or months (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Thus, decisions about infectiousness should be made on an individual basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB should be considered infectious if they (a) are coughing,
(b) are undergoing cough-inducing procedures, or (c) have positive AFB sputum smears, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if they (a) are not on chemotherapy, (b) have just started chemotherapy, or (c) have a poor clinical or bacteriologic
response to chemotherapy. A patient who has drug-susceptible TB and who is on adequate chemotherapy and has had a significant
clinical and bacteriologic response to therapy (i.e., reduction in cough, resolution of fever, and progressively
decreasing quantity of bacilli on smear) is probably no longer infectious. However, because drug-susceptibility
results are not usually known when the decision to discontinue isolation is made, all TB patients should remain in
isolation while hospitalized until they have had three consecutive negative sputum smears collected on different
days and they demonstrate clinical improvement.

I. Diagnostic Procedures for TB Infection and Disease
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A diagnosis of TB may be considered for any patient who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks) or other
signs or symptoms compatible with TB (e.g., bloody sputum, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, or fever). However,
the index of suspicion for TB will vary in different geographic areas and will depend on the prevalence of TB and other
characteristics of the population served by the facility. The index of suspicion for TB should be very high in areas
or among groups of patients in which the prevalence of TB is high (Section I.B). Persons for whom a diagnosis of TB is
being considered should receive appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include PPD skin testing, chest radiography,
and bacteriologic studies (e.g., sputum microscopy and culture).

A. PPD Skin Testing and Anergy Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Application and Reading of PPD Skin Tests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PPD skin test is the only method available for demonstrating infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although currently available PPD tests are &lt;100% sensitive and specific for detection of infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
no better diagnostic methods have yet been devised. Interpretation of PPD test results requires knowledge of the
antigen used, the immunologic basis for the reaction to this antigen, the technique used to administer and read the
test, and the results of epidemiologic and clinical experience with the test (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2,5,6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The PPD test, like all medical tests, is subject to variability, but many of the variations in administering and
reading PPD tests can be avoided by proper training and careful attention to details.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intracutaneous (Mantoux) administration of a measured amount of PPD-tuberculin is currently the preferred
method for doing the test. One-tenth milliliter of PPD (5 TU) is injected just beneath the surface of the skin on either
the volar or dorsal surface of the forearm. A discrete, pale elevation of the skin (i.e., a wheal) that is 6&hyph;10
mm in diameter should be produced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPD test results should be read by designated, trained personnel between 48 and 72 hours after injection. Patient
or HCW self-reading of PPD test results should not be accepted (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
68
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The result of the test is based on the presence or absence of an induration at the injection site. Redness or erythema
should not be measured. The transverse diameter of induration should be recorded in millimeters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Interpretation of PPD Skin Tests

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. General.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interpretation of a PPD reaction should be influenced by the purpose for which the test was given (e.g., epidemiologic
versus diagnostic purposes), by the prevalence of TB infection in the population being tested, and by the consequences
of false classification. Errors in classification can be minimized by establishing an appropriate definition of
a positive reaction (Table S2&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The positive-predictive value of PPD tests (i.e, the probability that a person with a positive PPD test is actually
infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is dependent on the prevalence of TB infection in the population being tested and the specificity of the test (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
69,70
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). In populations with a low prevalence of TB infection, the probability that a positive PPD test represents true infection
with

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

is very low if the cut-point is set too low (i.e., the test is not adequately specific). In populations with a high prevalence
of TB infection, the probability that a positive PPD test using the same cut-point represents true infection with

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is much higher. To ensure that few persons infected with tubercle bacilli will be misclassified as having negative
reactions and few persons not infected with tubercle bacilli will be misclassified as having positive reactions,
different cut-points are used to separate positive reactions from negative reactions for different populations,
depending on the risk for TB infection in that population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A lower cut-point (i.e., 5 mm) is used for persons in the highest risk groups, which include HIV-infected persons,
recent close contacts of persons with TB (e.g., in the household or in an unprotected occupational exposure similar
in intensity and duration to household contact), and persons who have abnormal chest radiographs with fibrotic changes
consistent with inactive TB. A higher cut-point (i.e., 10 mm) is used for persons who are not in the highest risk group
but who have other risk factors (e.g., injecting-drug users known to be HIV seronegative; persons with certain medical
conditions that increase the risk for progression from latent TB infection to active TB [Table S2&hyph;1]); medically
underserved, low-income populations; persons born in foreign countries that have a high prevalence of TB; and residents
of correctional institutions and nursing homes). An even higher cut-point (i.e., 15 mm) is used for all other persons
who have none of the above risk factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent PPD converters are considered members of a high-risk group. A "10 mm increase in the size of the induration within
a 2-year period is classified as a conversion from a negative to a positive test result for persons &lt;35 years of age.
An increase of induration of "15 mm within a 2-year period is classified as a conversion for persons "35 years of age
(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. HCWs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, HCWs should have their skin-test results interpreted according to the recommendations in this supplement
and in sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Table S2&hyph;1. However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered
when choosing the appropriate cut-point for defining a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where there is essentially
no risk for exposure to TB patients (i.e., minimal- or very low-risk facilities [Section II.B]), an induration "15
mm may be an appropriate cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors. In other facilities where TB patients receive
care, the appropriate cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors may be "10 mm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recent PPD test conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as an increase of "10 mm in the size of induration within
a 2-year period. For HCWs in facilities where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an
increase of "15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent conversion because of the lower
positive-predictive value of the test in such groups.

3. Anergy Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HIV-infected persons may have suppressed reactions to PPD skin tests because of anergy, particularly if their CD4+
T-lymphocyte counts decline (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
71
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Persons with anergy will have a negative PPD test regardless of infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HIV-infected persons should be evaluated for anergy in conjunction with PPD testing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
72
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Two companion antigens (e.g., Candida antigen and tetanus toxoid) should be administered in addition to PPD. Persons
with "3 mm of induration to any of the skin tests (including tuberculin) are considered not anergic. Reactions of "5
mm to PPD are considered to be evidence of TB infection in HIV-infected persons regardless of the reactions to the companion
antigens. If there is no reaction (i.e., &lt;3 mm induration) to any of the antigens, the person being tested is considered
anergic. Determination of whether such persons are likely to be infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
must be based on other epidemiologic factors (e.g., the proportion of other persons with the same level of exposure
who have positive PPD test results and the intensity or duration of exposure to infectious TB patients that the anergic
person experienced).

4. Pregnancy and PPD Skin Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although thousands (perhaps millions) of pregnant women have been PPD skin tested since the test was devised, thus
far no documented episodes of fetal harm have resulted from use of the tuberculin test (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
73
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Pregnancy should not exclude a female HCW from being skin tested as part of a contact investigation or as part of a
regular skin-testing program.

&bull;Persons who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or risk factors for HIV infection but unknown
HIV status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Persons who have had recent close contact* with persons who have active tuberculosis (TB); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>

&bull;Persons born in countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America that have high prevalence of TB;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Persons from medically underserved, low-income populations;

&bull;Persons from high-risk populations in their communities, as determined by local public health authorities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An induration of "15 mm is classified as positive in persons who do not meet any of the above criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Recent converters are defined on the basis of both size of induration and age of the person being tested: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;"10 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for persons &lt;35 years of age;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;"15 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for persons "35 years of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. PPD skin-test results in health-care workers (HCWs)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In general, the recommendations in sections 1, 2, and 3 of this table should be followed when interpreting skin-test
results in HCWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered when choosing the appropriate cut-point for defining
a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where there is essentially no risk for exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i.e., minimal- or very low-risk facilities [Section II.B]), an induration "15 mm may be a suitable cut-point for
HCWs who have no other risk factors. In facilities where TB patients receive care, the cut-point for HCWs with no other
risk factors maybe "10 mm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A recent conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as a "10 mm increase in size of induration within a 2-year
period. For HCWs who work in facilities where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an
increase of "15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent conversion because of the lower
positive-predictive value of the test in such groups.

5. BCG Vaccination and PPD Skin Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BCG vaccination may produce a PPD reaction that cannot be distinguished reliably from a reaction caused by infection
with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For a person who was vaccinated with BCG, the probability that a PPD test reaction results from infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increases (a) as the size of the reaction increases, (b) when the person is a contact of a person with TB, (c) when the
person's country of origin has a high prevalence of TB, and (d) as the length of time between vaccination and PPD testing
increases. For example, a PPD test reaction of "10 mm probably can be attributed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 infection in an adult who was vaccinated with BCG as a child and who is from a country with a high prevalence of TB (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The Booster Phenomenon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ability of persons who have TB infection to react to PPD may gradually wane. For example, if tested with PPD, adults
who were infected during their childhood may have a negative reaction. However, the PPD could boost the hypersensitivity,
and the size of the reaction could be larger on a subsequent test. This boosted reaction may be misinterpreted as a PPD
test conversion from a newly acquired infection. Misinterpretation of a boosted reaction as a new infection could
result in unnecessary investigations of laboratory and patient records in an attempt to identify the source case
and in unnecessary prescription of preventive therapy for HCWs. Although boosting can occur among persons in any
age group, the likelihood of the reaction increases with the age of the person being tested (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6,76
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When PPD testing of adults is to be repeated periodically (as in HCW skin-testing programs), two-step testing can
be used to reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction is misinterpreted as a new infection. Two-step testing should
be performed on all newly employed HCWs who have an initial negative PPD test result at the time of employment and have
not had a documented negative PPD test result during the 12 months preceding the initial test. A second test should
be performed 1&hyph;3 weeks after the first test. If the second test result is positive, this is most likely a boosted
reaction, and the HCW should be classified as previously infected. If the second test result remains negative, the
HCW is classified as uninfected, and a positive reaction to a subsequent test is likely to represent a new infection
with

B. Chest Radiography 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Patients who have positive skin-test results or symptoms suggestive of TB should be evaluated with a chest radiograph
regardless of PPD test results. Radiographic abnormalities that strongly suggest active TB include upper-lobe
infiltration, particularly if cavitation is seen (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
77
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and patchy or nodular infiltrates in the apical or subapical posterior upper lobes or the superior segment of the
lower lobe. If abnormalities are noted, or if the patient has symptoms suggestive of extrapulmonary TB, additional
diagnostic tests should be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radiographic presentation of pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients may be unusual (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
78
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Typical apical cavitary disease is less common among such patients. They may have infiltrates in any lung zone,
a finding that is often associated with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy, or they may have a normal chest radiograph,
although this latter finding occurs rarely.

C. Bacteriology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Smear and culture examination of at least three sputum specimens collected on different days is the main diagnostic
procedure for pulmonary TB (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Sputum smears that fail to demonstrate AFB do not exclude the diagnosis of TB. In the United States, approximately
60% of patients with positive sputum cultures have positive AFB sputum smears. HIV-infected patients who have pulmonary
TB may be less likely than immunocompetent patients to have AFB present on sputum smears, which is consistent with
the lower frequency of cavitary pulmonary disease observed among HIV-infected persons (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
39,41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specimens for smear and culture should contain an adequate amount of expectorated sputum but not much saliva. If a
diagnosis of TB cannot be established from sputum, a bronchoscopy may be necessary (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
36,37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). In young children who cannot produce an adequate amount of sputum, gastric aspirates may provide an adequate specimen
for diagnosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A culture of sputum or other clinical specimen that contains 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provides a definitive diagnosis of TB. Conventional laboratory methods may require 4&hyph;8 weeks for species identification;
however, the use of radiometric culture techniques and nucleic acid probes facilitates more rapid detection and
identification of mycobacteria (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
79,80
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Mixed mycobacterial infection, either simultaneous or sequential, can obscure the identification of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 during the clinical evaluation and the laboratory analysis (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The use of nucleic acid probes for both

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be useful for identifying mixed mycobacterial infections in clinical specimens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Preventive Therapy for Latent TB Infection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Determining whether a person with a positive PPD test reaction or conversion is a candidate for preventive therapy
must be based on (a) the likelihood that the reaction represents true infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (as determined by the cut-points), (b) the estimated risk for progression from latent infection to active TB, and
(c) the risk for hepatitis associated with taking isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy (as determined by age and other
factors). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCWs with positive PPD test results should be evaluated for preventive therapy regardless of their ages if they (a)
are recent converters, (b) are close contacts of persons who have active TB, (c) have a medical condition that increases
the risk for TB, (d) have HIV infection, or (e) use injecting drugs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). HCWs with positive PPD test results who do not have these risk factors should be evaluated for preventive therapy
if they are &lt;35 years of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Preventive therapy should be considered for anergic persons who are known contacts of infectious TB patients and
for persons from populations in which the prevalence of TB infection is very high (e.g., a prevalence of >10%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the risk for INH-associated hepatitis may be increased during the peripartum period, the decision to use
preventive therapy during pregnancy should be made on an individual basis and should depend on the patient's estimated
risk for progression to active disease. In general, preventive therapy can be delayed until after delivery. However,
for pregnant women who were probably infected recently or who have high-risk medical conditions, especially HIV
infection, INH preventive therapy should begin when the infection is documented (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
81&hyph;84
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). No evidence suggests that INH poses a carcinogenic risk to humans (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
85&hyph;87
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The usual preventive therapy regimen is oral INH 300 mg daily for adults and 10 mg/kg/day for children (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
88
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The recommended duration of therapy is 12 months for persons with HIV infection and 9 months for children. Other
persons should receive INH therapy for 6&hyph;12 months. For persons who have silicosis or a chest radiograph demonstrating
inactive fibrotic lesions and who have no evidence of active TB, acceptable regimens include (a) 4 months of INH plus
rifampin or (b) 12 months of INH, providing that infection with INH-resistant organisms is unlikely (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). For persons likely to be infected with MDR-TB, alternative multidrug preventive therapy regimens should be considered
(

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All persons placed on preventive therapy should be educated regarding the possible adverse reactions associated
with INH use, and they should be questioned carefully at monthly intervals by qualified personnel for signs or symptoms
consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
81&hyph;84,88,90,91
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Because INH-associated hepatitis occurs more frequently among persons >35 years of age, a transaminase measurement
should be obtained from persons in this age group before initiation of INH therapy and then obtained monthly until
treatment has been completed. Other factors associated with an increased risk for hepatitis include daily alcohol
use, chronic liver disease, and injecting-drug use. In addition, postpubertal black and Hispanic women may be at
greater risk for hepatitis or drug interactions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
92
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). More careful clinical monitoring of persons with these risk factors and possibly more frequent laboratory monitoring
should be considered. If any of these tests exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation
of INH should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for monthly clinical evaluations
or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions that could occur between the regularly scheduled
evaluations (

Drug-susceptibility testing should be performed on all initial isolates from patients with TB. However, test results
may not be available for several weeks, making selection of an initial regimen difficult, especially in areas where
drug-resistant TB has been documented. Current recommendations for therapy and dosage schedules for the treatment
of drug-susceptible TB should be followed (Table S2&hyph;2; Table S2&hyph;3) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Streptomycin is contraindicated in the treatment of pregnant women because of the risk for ototoxicity to the fetus.
In geographic areas or facilities in which drug-resistant TB is highly prevalent, the initial treatment regimen
used while results of drug-susceptibility tests are pending may need to be expanded. This decision should be based
on analysis of surveillance data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When results from drug-susceptibility tests become available, the regimen should be adjusted appropriately (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
94&hyph;97
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). If drug resistance is present, clinicians unfamiliar with the management of patients with drug-resistant TB should
seek expert consultation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For any regimen to be effective, adherence to the regimen must be ensured. The most effective method of ensuring adherence
is the use of DOT after the patient has been discharged from the hospital (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This practice should be coordinated with the public health department.

For infants and children with miliary TB, bone and joint TB, or TB meningitis, treatment should last at least 12 months.
For adults with these forms of extrapulmonary TB, response to therapy should be monitored closely. If response is
slow or suboptimal, treatment may be prolonged on a case-by-case basis.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This supplement provides information regarding the use of ventilation (Section II) and UVGI (Section III) for preventing
the transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in health-care facilities. The information provided is primarily conceptual and is intended to educate staff in
the health-care facility concerning engineering controls and how these controls can be used as part of the TB infection-control
program. This supplement should not be used in place of consultation with experts, who can assume responsibility
for advising on ventilation system design and selection, installation, and maintenance of equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommendations for engineering controls include (a) local exhaust ventilation (i.e., source control), (b)
general ventilation, and (c) air cleaning. General ventilation considerations include (a) dilution and removal
of contaminants, (b) airflow patterns within rooms, (c) airflow direction in facilities, (d) negative pressure
in rooms, and (e) TB isolation rooms. Air cleaning or disinfection can be accomplished by filtration of air (e.g.,
through HEPA filters) or by UVGI.

II. Ventilation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ventilation systems for health-care facilities should be designed, and modified when necessary, by ventilation
engineers in collaboration with infection-control and occupational health staff. Recommendations for designing
and operating ventilation systems have been published by ASHRAE (

As part of the TB infection-control plan, health-care facility personnel should determine the number of TB isolation
rooms, treatment rooms, and local exhaust devices (i.e., for cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures)
that the facility needs. The locations of these rooms and devices will depend on where in the facility the ventilation
conditions recommended in this document can be achieved. Grouping isolation rooms together in one area of the facility
may facilitate the care of TB patients and the installation and maintenance of optimal engineering controls (particularly
ventilation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic evaluations of the ventilation system should review the number of TB isolation rooms, treatment rooms,
and local exhaust devices needed and the regular maintenance and monitoring of the local and general exhaust systems
(including HEPA filtration systems if they are used).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The various types and conditions of ventilation systems in health-care facilities and the individual needs of these
facilities preclude the ability to provide specific instructions regarding the implementation of these recommendations.
Engineering control methods must be tailored to each facility on the basis of need and the feasibility of using the
ventilation and air-cleaning concepts discussed in this supplement.

A. Local Exhaust Ventilation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To capture airborne contaminants at or near their source (i.e., the source control method) and remove these contaminants
without exposing persons in the area to infectious agents (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
98
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Source control techniques can prevent or reduce the spread of infectious droplet nuclei into the general air circulation
by entrapping infectious droplet nuclei as they are being emitted by the patient (i.e., the source). These techniques
are especially important when performing procedures likely to generate aerosols containing infectious particles
and when infectious TB patients are coughing or sneezing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local exhaust ventilation is a preferred source control technique, and it is often the most efficient way to contain
airborne contaminants because it captures these contaminants near their source before they can disperse. Therefore,
the technique should be used, if feasible, wherever aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Two basic types
of local exhaust devices use hoods: (a) The enclosing type, in which the hood either partially or fully encloses the
infectious source; and (b) the exterior type, in which the infectious source is near but outside the hood. Fully enclosed
hoods, booths, or tents are always preferable to exterior types because of their superior ability to prevent contaminants
from escaping into the HCW's breathing zone. Descriptions of both enclosing and exterior devices have been published
previously (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Enclosing Devices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The enclosing type of local exhaust ventilation device includes laboratory hoods used for processing specimens
that could contain viable infectious organisms, booths used for sputum induction or administration of aerosolized
medications (e.g., aerosolized pentamidine) (Figure S3&hyph;1), and tents or hoods made of vinyl or other materials
used to enclose and isolate a patient. These devices are available in various configurations. The most simple of these
latter devices is a tent that is placed over the patient; the tent has an exhaust connection to the room discharge exhaust
system. The most complex device is an enclosure that has a sophisticated self-contained airflow and recirculation
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both tents and booths should have sufficient airflow to remove at least 99% of airborne particles during the interval
between the departure of one patient and the arrival of the next (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
99
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The time required for removing a given percentage of airborne particles from an enclosed space depends on several
factors. These factors include the number of ACH, which is determined by the number of cubic feet of air in the room or
booth and the rate at which air is entering the room or booth at the intake source; the location of the ventilation inlet
and outlet; and the physical configuration of the room or booth (Table S3&hyph;1).

2. Exterior Devices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exterior type of local exhaust ventilation device is usually a hood very near, but not enclosing, the infectious
patient. The airflow produced by these devices should be sufficient to prevent cross-currents of air near the patient's
face from causing escape of droplet nuclei. Whenever possible, the patient should face directly into the hood opening
so that any coughing or sneezing is directed into the hood, where the droplet nuclei are captured. The device should
maintain an air velocity of " 200 feet per minute at the patient's breathing zone to ensure capture of droplet nuclei.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Discharge Exhaust From Booths, Tents, and Hoods
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air from booths, tents, and hoods may be discharged into the room in which the device is located or it may be exhausted
to the outside. If the air is discharged into the room, a HEPA filter should be incorporated at the discharge duct or
vent of the device. The exhaust fan should be located on the discharge side of the HEPA filter to ensure that the air pressure
in the filter housing and booth is negative with respect to adjacent areas. Uncontaminated air from the room will flow
into the booth through all openings, thus preventing infectious droplet nuclei in the booth from escaping into the
room. Most commercially available booths, tents, and hoods are fitted with HEPA filters, in which case additional
HEPA filtration is not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the device does not incorporate a HEPA filter, the air from the device should be exhausted to the outside in accordance
with recommendations for isolation room exhaust (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.5). (See Supplement 3, Section II.C, for
information regarding recirculation of exhaust air.)

B. General Ventilation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General ventilation can be used for several purposes, including diluting and removing contaminated air, controlling
airflow patterns within rooms, and controlling the direction of airflow throughout a facility. Information on these
topics is contained in the following sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Dilution and Removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reduce the concentration of contaminants in the air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General ventilation maintains air quality by two processes: dilution and removal of airborne contaminants. Uncontaminated
supply (i.e., incoming) air mixes with the contaminated room air (i.e., dilution), which is subsequently removed
from the room by the exhaust system (i.e., removal). These processes reduce the concentration of droplet nuclei in
the room air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Types of general ventilation systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two types of general ventilation systems can be used for dilution and removal of contaminated air: the single-pass
system and the recirculating system. In a single-pass system, the supply air is either outside air that has been appropriately
heated and cooled or air from a central system that supplies a number of areas. After air passes through the room (or
area), 100% of that air is exhausted to the outside. The single-pass system is the preferred choice in areas where infectious
airborne droplet nuclei are known to be present (e.g., TB isolation rooms or treatment rooms) because it prevents
contaminated air from being recirculated to other areas of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a recirculating system, a small portion of the exhaust air is discharged to the outside and is replaced with fresh
outside air, which mixes with the portion of exhaust air that was not discharged to the outside. The resulting mixture,
which can contain a large proportion of contaminated air, is then recirculated to the areas serviced by the system.
This air mixture could be recirculated into the general ventilation, in which case contaminants may be carried from
contaminated areas to uncontaminated areas. Alternatively, the air mixture could also be recirculated within a
specific room or area, in which case other areas of the facility will not be affected (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Ventilation rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommended general ventilation rates for health-care facilities are usually expressed in number of ACH. This number
is the ratio of the volume of air entering the room per hour to the room volume and is equal to the exhaust airflow (Q [cubic
feet per minute]) divided by the room volume (V [cubic feet]) multiplied by 60 (i.e., ACH = Q 
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
 V &times; 60). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The feasibility of achieving specific ventilation rates depends on the construction and operational requirements
of the ventilation system (e.g., the energy requirements to move and to heat or cool the air). The feasibility of achieving
specific ventilation rates may also be different for retrofitted facilities and newly constructed facilities.
The expense and effort of achieving specific higher ventilation rates for new construction may be reasonable, whereas
retrofitting an existing facility to achieve similar ventilation rates may be more difficult. However, achieving
higher ventilation rates by using auxiliary methods (e.g., room-air recirculation) in addition to exhaust ventilation
may be feasible in existing facilities (Suppl. 3, Section II.C).

2. Airflow Patterns Within Rooms (Air Mixing) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide optimum airflow patterns and prevent both stagnation and short-circuiting of air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General ventilation systems should be designed to provide optimal patterns of airflow within rooms and prevent air
stagnation or short-circuiting of air from the supply to the exhaust (i.e., passage of air directly from the air supply
to the air exhaust). To provide optimal airflow patterns, the air supply and exhaust should be located such that clean
air first flows to parts of the room where HCWs are likely to work, and then flows across the infectious source and into
the exhaust. In this way, the HCW is not positioned between the infectious source and the exhaust location. Although
this configuration may not always be possible, it should be used whenever feasible. One way to achieve this airflow
pattern is to supply air at the side of the room opposite the patient and exhaust it from the side where the patient is
located. Another method, which is most effective when the supply air is cooler than the room air, is to supply air near
the ceiling and exhaust it near the floor (Figure S3&hyph;2). Airflow patterns are affected by large air temperature
differentials, the precise location of the supply and exhausts, the location of furniture, the movement of HCWs and
patients, and the physical configuration of the space. Smoke tubes can be used to visualize airflow patterns in a manner
similar to that described for estimating room air mixing.

Adequate air mixing, which requires that an adequate number of ACH be provided to a room (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.1),
must be ensured to prevent air stagnation within the room. However, the air will not usually be changed the calculated
number of times per hour because the airflow patterns in the room may not permit complete mixing of the supply and room
air in all parts of the room. This results in an ``effective'' airflow rate in which the supplied airflow may be less
than required for proper ventilation. To account for this variation, a mixing factor (which ranges from 1 for perfect
mixing to 10 for poor mixing) is applied as a multiplier to determine the actual supply airflow (i.e., the recommended
ACH multiplied by the mixing factor equals the actual required ACH) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The room air supply and exhaust system should be designed to achieve the lowest mixing factor possible. The mixing
factor is determined most accurately by experimentally testing each space configuration, but this procedure is
complex and time-consuming. A reasonably good qualitative measure of mixing can be estimated by an experienced ventilation
engineer who releases smoke from smoke tubes at a number of locations in the room and observes the movement of the smoke.
Smoke movement in all areas of the room indicates good mixing. Stagnation of air in some areas of the room indicates
poor mixing, and movement of the supply and exhaust openings or redirection of the supply air is necessary.

3. Airflow Direction in the Facility

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To contain contaminated air in localized areas in a facility and prevent its spread to uncontaminated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Directional airflow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general ventilation system should be designed and balanced so that air flows from less contaminated (i.e., more
clean) to more contaminated (less clean) areas (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
47,48
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). For example, air should flow from corridors (cleaner areas) into TB isolation rooms (less clean areas) to prevent
spread of contaminants to other areas. In some special treatment rooms in which operative and invasive procedures
are performed, the direction of airflow is from the room to the hallway to provide cleaner air during these procedures.
Cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy and irrigation of tuberculous abscesses)
should not be performed in rooms with this type of airflow on patients who may have infectious TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Negative pressure for achieving directional airflow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The direction of airflow is controlled by creating a lower (negative) pressure in the area into which the flow of air
is desired. For air to flow from one area to another, the air pressure in the two areas must be different. Air will flow
from a higher pressure area to a lower pressure area. The lower pressure area is described as being at negative* pressure
relative to the higher pressure area. Negative pressure is attained by exhausting air from an area at a higher rate
than air is being supplied. The level of negative pressure necessary to achieve the desired airflow will depend on
the physical configuration of the ventilation system and area, including the airflow path and flow openings, and
should be determined on an individual basis by an experienced ventilation engineer.

4. Achieving Negative Pressure in a Room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To control the direction of airflow between the room and adjacent areas, thereby preventing contaminated air from
escaping from the room into other areas of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Pressure differential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum pressure difference necessary to achieve and maintain negative pressure that will result in airflow
into the room is very small (0.001 inch of water). Higher pressures (" 0.001 inch of water) are satisfactory; however,
these higher pressures may be difficult to achieve. The actual level of negative pressure achieved will depend on
the difference in the ventilation exhaust and supply flows and the physical configuration of the room, including
the airflow path and flow openings. If the room is well sealed, negative pressures greater than the minimum of 0.001
inch of water may be readily achieved. However, if rooms are not well sealed, as may be the case in many facilities (especially
older facilities), achieving higher negative pressures may require exhaust/supply flow differentials beyond
the capability of the ventilation system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To establish negative pressure in a room that has a normally functioning ventilation system, the room supply and exhaust
airflows are first balanced to achieve an exhaust flow of either 10% or 50 cubic feet per minute (cfm) greater than the
supply (whichever is the greater). In most situations, this specification should achieve a negative pressure of
at least 0.001 inch of water. If the minimum 0.001 inch of water is not achieved and cannot be achieved by increasing
the flow differential (within the limits of the ventilation system), the room should be inspected for leakage (e.g.,
through doors, windows, plumbing, and equipment wall penetrations), and corrective action should be taken to seal
the leaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negative pressure in a room can be altered by changing the ventilation system operation or by the opening and closing
of the room's doors, corridor doors, or windows. When an operating configuration has been established, it is essential
that all doors and windows remain properly closed in the isolation room and other areas (e.g., doors in corridors that
affect air pressure) except when persons need to enter or leave the room or area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Alternate methods for achieving negative pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although an anteroom is not a substitute for negative pressure in a room, it may be used to reduce escape of droplet nuclei
during opening and closing of the isolation room door. Some anterooms have their own air supply duct, but others do
not. The TB isolation room should have negative pressure relative to the anteroom, but the air pressure in the anteroom
relative to the corridor may vary depending on the building design. This should be determined, in accordance with
applicable regulations, by a qualified ventilation engineer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the existing ventilation system is incapable of achieving the desired negative pressure because the room lacks
a separate ventilation system or the room's system cannot provide the proper airflow, steps should be taken to provide
a means to discharge air from the room. The amount of air to be exhausted will be the same as discussed previously (Suppl.
3, Section II.B.4.a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fixed room-air recirculation systems (i.e., systems that recirculate the air in an entire room) may be designed to
achieve negative pressure by discharging air outside the room (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some portable room-air recirculation units (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3.b.) are designed to discharge air to the outside
to achieve negative pressure. Air cleaners that can accomplish this must be designed specifically for this purpose.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small centrifugal blower (i.e., exhaust fan) can be used to exhaust air to the outside through a window or outside
wall. This approach may be used as an interim measure to achieve negative pressure, but it provides no fresh air and
suboptimal dilution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another approach to achieving the required pressure difference is to pressurize the corridor. Using this method,
the corridor's general ventilation system is balanced to create a higher air pressure in the corridor than in the isolation
room; the type of balancing necessary depends on the configuration of the ventilation system. Ideally, the corridor
air supply rate should be increased while the corridor exhaust rate is not increased. If this is not possible, the exhaust
rate should be decreased by resetting appropriate exhaust dampers. Caution should be exercised, however, to ensure
that the exhaust rate is not reduced below acceptable levels. This approach requires that all settings used to achieve
the pressure balance, including doors, be maintained. This method may not be desirable if the corridor being pressurized
has rooms in which negative pressure is not desired. In many situations, this system is difficult to achieve, and it
should be considered only after careful review by ventilation personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Monitoring negative pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The negative pressure in a room can be monitored by visually observing the direction of airflow (e.g., using smoke
tubes) or by measuring the differential pressure between the room and its surrounding area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smoke from a smoke tube can be used to observe airflow between areas or airflow patterns within an area. To check the
negative pressure in a room by using a smoke tube, hold the smoke tube near the bottom of the door and approximately 2
inches in front of the door, or at the face of a grille or other opening if the door has such a feature, and generate a small
amount of smoke by gently squeezing the bulb (Figure S3&hyph;3). The smoke tube should be held parallel to the door,
and the smoke should be issued from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower
the air velocity. The smoke will travel in the direction of airflow. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will
travel under the door and into the room (e.g., from higher to lower pressure). If the room is not at negative pressure,
the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary. This test must be performed while the door is closed. If room
air cleaners are being used in the room, they should be running. The smoke is irritating if inhaled, and care should
be taken not to inhale it directly from the smoke tube. However, the quantity of smoke issued from the tube is minimal
and is not detectable at short distances from the tube. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differential pressure-sensing devices also can be used to monitor negative pressure; they can provide either periodic
(noncontinuous) pressure measurements or continuous pressure monitoring. The continuous monitoring component
may simply be a visible and/or audible warning signal that air pressure is low. In addition, it may also provide a pressure
readout signal, which can be recorded for later verification or used to automatically adjust the facility's ventilation
control system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pressure-measuring devices should sense the room pressure just inside the airflow path into the room (e.g., at the
bottom of the door). Unusual airflow patterns within the room can cause pressure variations; for example, the air
can be at negative pressure at the middle of a door and at positive pressure at the bottom of the same door (Figure S3&hyph;4).
If the pressure-sensing ports of the device cannot be located directly across the airflow path, it will be necessary
to validate that the negative pressure at the sensing point is and remains the same as the negative pressure across
the flow path. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pressure-sensing devices should incorporate an audible warning with a time delay to indicate that a door is open.
When the door to the room is opened, the negative pressure will decrease. The time-delayed signal should allow sufficient
time for persons to enter or leave the room without activating the audible warning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A potential problem with using pressure-sensing devices is that the pressure differentials used to achieve the low
negative pressure necessitate the use of very sensitive mechanical devices, electronic devices, or pressure gauges
to ensure accurate measurements. Use of devices that cannot measure these low pressures (i.e., pressures as low as
0.001 inch of water) will require setting higher negative pressures that may be difficult and, in some instances,
impractical to achieve (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic checks are required to ensure that the desired negative pressure is present and that the continuous monitoring
devices, if used, are operating properly. If smoke tubes or other visual checks are used, TB isolation rooms and treatment
rooms should be checked frequently for negative pressure. Rooms undergoing changes to the ventilation system should
be checked daily. TB isolation rooms should be checked daily for negative pressure while being used for TB isolation.
If these rooms are not being used for patients who have suspected or confirmed TB but potentially could be used for such
patients, the negative pressure in the rooms should be checked monthly. If pressure-sensing devices are used, negative
pressure should be verified at least once a month by using smoke tubes or taking pressure measurements.

To remove contaminants from the air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEPA filtration can be used as a method of air cleaning that supplements other recommended ventilation measures.
For the purposes of these guidelines, HEPA filters are defined as air-cleaning devices that have a demonstrated and
documented minimum removal efficiency of 99.97% of particles greater than or equal to 0.3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

has not been studied, but

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spores). Therefore, HEPA filters can be expected to remove infectious droplet nuclei from contaminated air. HEPA
filters can be used to clean air before it is exhausted to the outside, recirculated to other areas of a facility, or
recirculated within a room. If the device is not completely passive (e.g., it utilizes techniques such as electrostatics)
and the failure of the electrostatic components permits loss of filtration efficiency to less than 99.97%, the device
should not be used in systems that recirculate air back into the general facility ventilation system from TB isolation
rooms and treatment rooms in which procedures are performed on patients who may have infectious TB (Suppl. 3, Section
II.C.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEPA filters can be used in a number of ways to reduce or eliminate infectious droplet nuclei from room air or exhaust.
These methods include placement of HEPA filters (a) in exhaust ducts to remove droplet nuclei from air being discharged
to the outside, either directly or through ventilation equipment; (b) in ducts discharging room air into the general
ventilation system; and (c) in fixed or portable room-air cleaners. The effectiveness of portable HEPA room-air
cleaning units has not been evaluated adequately, and there is probably considerable variation in their effectiveness.
HEPA filters can also be used in exhaust ducts or vents that discharge air from booths or enclosures into the surrounding
room (Suppl. 3, Section II.A.3). In any application, HEPA filters should be installed carefully and maintained meticulously
to ensure adequate function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of room-air cleaning equipment should provide documentation of the HEPA filter efficiency and the
efficiency of the installed device in lowering room-air contaminant levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Use of HEPA Filtration When Exhausting Air to the Outside
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HEPA filters can be used as an added safety measure to clean air from isolation rooms and local exhaust devices (i.e.,
booths, tents, or hoods used for cough-inducing procedures) before exhausting it directly to the outside, but such
use is unnecessary if the exhaust air cannot re-enter the ventilation system supply. The use of HEPA filters should
be considered wherever exhaust air could possibly reenter the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many instances, exhaust air is not discharged directly to the outside; rather, the air is directed through heat-recovery
devices (e.g., heat wheels). Heat wheels are often used to reduce the costs of operating ventilation systems (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
103
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). If such units are used with the system, a HEPA filter should also be used. As the wheel rotates, energy is transferred
into or removed from the supply inlet air stream. The HEPA filter should be placed upstream from the heat wheel because
of the potential for leakage across the seals separating the inlet and exhaust chambers and the theoretical possibility
that droplet nuclei could be impacted on the wheel by the exhaust air and subsequently stripped off into the supply
air.

2. Recirculation of HEPA-Filtered Air to Other Areas of a Facility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms used to treat patients who have confirmed or suspected infectious
TB should be exhausted to the outside in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local regulations. The air
should not be recirculated into the general ventilation. In some instances, recirculation of air into the general
ventilation system from such rooms is unavoidable (i.e., in existing facilities in which the ventilation system
or facility configuration makes venting the exhaust to the outside impossible). In such cases, HEPA filters should
be installed in the exhaust duct leading from the room to the general ventilation system to remove infectious organisms
and particulates the size of droplet nuclei from the air before it is returned to the general ventilation system (Section
II.F; Suppl. 3). Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms in new or renovated facilities should not be recirculated
into the general ventilation system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Recirculation of HEPA-Filtered Air Within a Room
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individual room-air recirculation can be used in areas where there is no general ventilation system, where an existing
system is incapable of providing adequate airflow, or where an increase in ventilation is desired without affecting
the fresh air supply or negative pressure system already in place. Recirculation of HEPA-filtered air within a room
can be achieved in several ways: (a) by exhausting air from the room into a duct, filtering it through a HEPA filter installed
in the duct, and returning it to the room (Figure S3&hyph;5); (b) by filtering air through HEPA recirculation systems
mounted on the wall or ceiling of the room (Figure S3&hyph;6); or (c) by filtering air through portable HEPA recirculation
systems. In this document, the first two of these approaches are referred to as fixed room-air recirculation systems,
because the HEPA filter devices are fixed in place and are not easily movable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Fixed room-air recirculation systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferred method of recirculating HEPA-filtered air within a room is a built-in system, in which air is exhausted
from the room into a duct, filtered through a HEPA filter, and returned to the room (Figure S3&hyph;5). This technique
may be used to add air changes in areas where there is a recommended minimum ACH that is difficult to meet with general
ventilation alone. The air does not have to be conditioned, other than by the filtration, and this permits higher airflow
rates than the general ventilation system can usually achieve. An alternative is the use of HEPA filtration units
that are mounted on the wall or ceiling of the room (Figure S3&hyph;7). Fixed recirculation systems are preferred
over portable (free-standing) units because they can be installed and maintained with a greater degree of reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Portable room-air recirculation units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Portable HEPA filtration units may be considered for recirculating air within rooms in which there is no general ventilation
system, where the system is incapable of providing adequate airflow, or where increased effectiveness in room airflow
is desired. Effectiveness depends on circulating as much of the air in the room as possible through the HEPA filter,
which may be difficult to achieve and evaluate. The effectiveness of a particular unit can vary depending on the room's
configuration, the furniture and persons in the room, and placement of the HEPA filtration unit and the supply and
exhaust grilles. Therefore, the effectiveness of the portable unit may vary considerably in rooms with different
configurations or in the same room if moved from one location to another in the room. If portable units are used, caution
should be exercised to ensure they can recirculate all or nearly all of the room air through the HEPA filter. Some commercially
available units may not be able to meet this requirement because of design limitations or insufficient airflow capacity.
In addition, units should be designed and operated to ensure that persons in the room cannot interfere with or otherwise
compromise the functioning of the unit. Portable HEPA filtration units have not been evaluated adequately to determine
their role in TB infection-control programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Portable HEPA filtration units should be designed to achieve the equivalent of "12 ACH. They should also be designed
to ensure adequate air mixing in all areas of the hospital rooms in which they are used, and they should not interfere
with the current ventilation system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some HEPA filtration units employ UVGI for disinfecting air after HEPA filtration. However, whether exposing the
HEPA-filtered air to UV irradiation further decreases the concentration of contaminants is not known.

c. Evaluation of room-air recirculation systems and units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detailed and accurate evaluations of room-air recirculation systems and units require the use of sophisticated
test equipment and lengthy test procedures that are not practical. However, an estimate of the unit's ability to circulate
the air in the room can be made by visualizing airflow patterns as was described previously for estimating room air
mixing (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.1). If the air movement is good in all areas of the room, the unit should be effective.

4. Installing, Maintaining, and Monitoring HEPA Filters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proper installation and testing and meticulous maintenance are critical if a HEPA filtration system is used (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
104
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), especially if the system used recirculates air to other parts of the facility. Improper design, installation,
or maintenance could allow infectious particles to circumvent filtration and escape into the general ventilation
system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). HEPA filters should be installed to prevent leakage between filter segments and between the filter bed and its frame.
A regularly scheduled maintenance program is required to monitor the HEPA filter for possible leakage and for filter
loading. A quantitative leakage and filter performance test (e.g., the dioctal phthalate [DOP] penetration test
[
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
105
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
]) should be performed at the initial installation and every time the filter is changed or moved. The test should be
repeated every 6 months for filters in general-use areas and in areas with systems that exhaust air that is likely to
be contaminated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (e.g, TB isolation rooms).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manometer or other pressure-sensing device should be installed in the filter system to provide an accurate and objective
means of determining the need for filter replacement. Pressure drop characteristics of the filter are supplied by
the manufacturer of the filter. Installation of the filter should allow for maintenance that will not contaminate
the delivery system or the area served. For general infection-control purposes, special care should be taken to not
jar or drop the filter element during or after removal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scheduled maintenance program should include procedures for installation, removal, and disposal of filter
elements. HEPA filter maintenance should be performed only by adequately trained personnel. Appropriate respiratory
protection should be worn while performing maintenance and testing procedures. In addition, filter housing and
ducts leading to the housing should be labelled clearly with the words ``Contaminated Air'' (or a similar warning).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a HEPA filter is used, one or more lower efficiency disposable prefilters installed upstream will extend the
useful life of the HEPA filter. A disposable filter can increase the life of a HEPA filter by 25%. If the disposable filter
is followed by a 90% extended surface filter, the life of the HEPA filter can be extended almost 900% (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
98
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These prefilters should be handled and disposed of in the same manner as the HEPA filter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To separate patients who are likely to have infectious TB from other persons, to provide an environment that will allow
reduction of the concentration of droplet nuclei through various engineering methods, and to prevent the escape
of droplet nuclei from such rooms into the corridor and other areas of the facility using directional airflow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hierarchy of ventilation methods used to achieve a reduction in the concentration of droplet nuclei and to achieve
directional airflow using negative pressure has been developed (Table S3&hyph;2). The methods are listed in order
from the most desirable to the least desirable. The method selected will depend on the configuration of the isolation
room and the ventilation system in the facility; the determination should be made in consultation with a ventilation
engineer.

The effectiveness of portable room-air HEPA recirculation units can vary depending on the room's configuration,
the furniture and persons in the room, the placement of the unit, the supply and exhaust grilles, and the achievable
ventilation rates and air mixing. Units should be designed and operated to ensure that persons in the room cannot interfere
with or otherwise compromise the function of the unit. Fixed recirculating systems are preferred over portable units
in TB isolation rooms of facilities in which services are provided regularly to TB patients.

1. Preventing the Escape of Droplet Nuclei From the Room
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rooms used for TB isolation should be single-patient rooms with negative pressure relative to the corridor or other
areas connected to the room. Doors between the isolation room and other areas should remain closed except for entry
into or exit from the room. The room's openings (e.g., windows and electrical and plumbing entries) should be sealed
as much as possible. However, a small gap of 1/8 to 1/2 inch should be at the bottom of the door to provide a controlled
airflow path. Proper use of negative pressure will prevent contaminated air from escaping the room.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
49
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) recommend a minimum of 6 ACH for TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms. This ventilation rate is based on comfort-
and odor-control considerations. The effectiveness of this level of airflow in reducing the concentration of droplet
nuclei in the room, thus reducing the transmission of airborne pathogens, has not been evaluated directly or adequately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ventilation rates >6 ACH are likely to produce an incrementally greater reduction in the concentration of bacteria
in a room than are lower rates (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
50&hyph;52
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, accurate quantitation of decreases in risk that would result from specific increases in general ventilation
levels has not been performed and may not be possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce the concentration of droplet nuclei, TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms in existing health-care facilities
should have an airflow of "6 ACH. Where feasible, this airflow rate should be increased to "12 ACH by adjusting or modifying
the ventilation system or by using auxiliary means (e.g., recirculation of air through fixed HEPA filtration units
or portable air cleaners) (Suppl. 3, Section II.C) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
53
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). New construction or renovation of existing health-care facilities should be designed so that TB isolation rooms
achieve an airflow of "12 ACH.

3. Exhaust From TB Isolation Rooms and Treatment Rooms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms in which patients with infectious TB may be examined should be exhausted
directly to the outside of the building and away from air-intake vents, persons, and animals in accordance with federal,
state, and local regulations concerning environmental discharges. (See Suppl. 3, Section II.C, for information
regarding recirculation of exhaust air.) Exhaust ducts should not be located near areas that may be populated (e.g.,
near sidewalks or windows that could be opened). Ventilation system exhaust discharges and inlets should be designed
to prevent reentry of exhausted air. Wind blowing over a building creates a highly turbulent recirculation zone,
which can cause exhausted air to reenter the building (Figure S3&hyph;7). Exhaust flow should be discharged above
this zone (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.1). Design guidelines for proper placement of exhaust ducts can be found in the 1989

106
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). If recirculation of air from such rooms into the general ventilation system is unavoidable, the air should be passed
through a HEPA filter before recirculation (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.2).

Isolation can also be achieved by use of negative-pressure enclosures (e.g, tents or booths) (Suppl. 3, Section II.A.1).
These can be used to provide patient isolation in areas such as emergency rooms and medical testing and treatment areas
and to supplement isolation in designated isolation rooms.

Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To kill or inactivate airborne tubercle bacilli. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research has demonstrated that UVGI is effective in killing or inactivating tubercle bacilli under experimental
conditions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
66,107&hyph;110
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and in reducing transmission of other infections in hospitals (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
111
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), military housing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
112
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and classrooms (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
113&hyph;115
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Because of the results of numerous studies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
116&hyph;120
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the experiences of TB clinicians and mycobacteriologists during the past several decades, the use of UVGI has
been recommended as a supplement to other TB infection-control measures in settings where the need for killing or
inactivating tubercle bacilli is important (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2,4,121&hyph;125
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UV radiation is defined as that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum described by wavelengths from 100 to 400 nm.
For convenience of classification, the UV spectrum has been separated into three different wavelength bands: UV&hyph;A
(long wavelengths, range: 320&hyph;400 nm), UV&hyph;B (midrange wavelengths, range: 290&hyph;320 nm), and UV&hyph;C
(short wavelengths, range: 100&hyph;290 nm) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
126
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Commercially available UV lamps used for germicidal purposes are low-pressure mercury vapor lamps (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
127
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that emit radiant energy in the UV&hyph;C range, predominantly at a wavelength of 253.7 nm (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A. Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UVGI can be used as a method of air disinfection to supplement other engineering controls. Two systems of UVGI can be
used for this purpose: duct irradiation and upper-room air irradiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Duct Irradiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To inactivate tubercle bacilli without exposing persons to UVGI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In duct irradiation systems, UV lamps are placed inside ducts that remove air from rooms to disinfect the air before
it is recirculated. When UVGI duct systems are properly designed, installed, and maintained, high levels of UV radiation
may be produced in the duct work. The only potential for human exposure to this radiation occurs during maintenance
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Duct irradiation may be used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In a TB isolation room or treatment room to recirculate air from the room, through a duct containing UV lamps,
and back into the room. This recirculation method can increase the overall room airflow but does not increase the supply
of fresh outside air to the room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms, emergency rooms, and other general-use areas of a facility where
patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially contaminate the air, to recirculate air back into the general ventilation.
Duct-irradiation systems are dependent on airflow patterns within a room that ensure that all or nearly all of the
room air circulates through the duct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Upper-Room Air Irradiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To inactivate tubercle bacilli in the upper part of the room, while minimizing radiation exposure to persons in the
lower part of the room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In upper-room air irradiation, UVGI lamps are suspended from the ceiling or mounted on the wall. The bottom of the lamp
is shielded to direct the radiation upward but not downward. The system depends on air mixing to take irradiated air
from the upper to the lower part of the room, and nonirradiated air from the lower to the upper part. The irradiated air
space is much larger than that in a duct system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UVGI has been effective in killing bacteria under conditions where air mixing was accomplished mainly by convection.
For example, BCG was atomized in a room that did not have supplemental ventilation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
120
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and in another study a surrogate bacteria, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serratia marcesens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, was aerosolized in a room with a ventilation rate of 6 ACH (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
129
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These reports estimated the effect of UVGI to be equivalent to 10 and 39 ACH, respectively, for the organisms tested,
which are less resistant to UVGI than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
120
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The addition of fans or some heating/air conditioning arrangements may double the effectiveness of UVGI lamps
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
130&hyph;132
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Greater rates of ventilation, however, may decrease the length of time the air is irradiated, thus decreasing the
killing of bacteria (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
117,129
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The optimal relationship between ventilation and UVGI is not known. Air irradiation lamps used in corridors have

). Use of UVGI lamps in an outpatient room has reduced culturable airborne bacteria by 14%&hyph;19%. However, the
irradiation did not reduce the concentration of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria; although fast-growing mycobacteria
were cultured,

M. tuberculosis

Upper-room air UVGI irradiation may be used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In isolation or treatment rooms as a supplemental method of air cleaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms, emergency rooms, corridors, and other central areas of a facility
where patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially contaminate the air. Determinants of UVGI effectiveness include
room configuration, UV lamp placement, and the adequacy of airflow patterns in bringing contaminated air into contact
with the irradiated upper-room space. Air mixing may be facilitated by supplying cool air near the ceiling in rooms
where warmer air (or a heating device) is present below. The ceiling should be high enough for a large volume of upper-room
air to be irradiated without HCWs and patients being overexposed to UV radiation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Duct systems using UVGI are not recommended as a substitute for HEPA filters if air from isolation rooms must be recirculated
to other areas of a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. UVGI alone is not recommended as a substitute for HEPA filtration or local exhaust of air to the outside from booths,
tents, or hoods used for cough-inducing procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. UVGI is not a substitute for negative pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of UV lamps and HEPA filtration in a single unit would not be expected to have any infection-control benefits
not provided by use of the HEPA filter alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effectiveness of UVGI in killing airborne tubercle bacilli depends on the intensity of UVGI, the duration of contact
the organism has with the irradiation, and the relative humidity (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
66,108,111
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Humidity can have an adverse effect on UVGI effectiveness at levels >70% relative humidity for

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
135
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The interaction of these factors has not been fully defined, however, making precise recommendations for individual
UVGI installations difficult to develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Old lamps or dust-covered UV lamps are less effective; therefore, regular maintenance of UVGI systems is crucial.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Safety Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Short-term overexposure to UV radiation can cause erythema and keratoconjunctivitis (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
136,137
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Broad-spectrum UV radiation has been associated with increased risk for squamous and basal cell carcinomas of
the skin (138). UV&hyph;C was recently classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as ``probably
carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A)'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
138
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This classification is based on studies suggesting that UV&hyph;C radiation can induce skin cancers in animals;
DNA damage, chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange and transformation in human cells in vitro; and
DNA damage in mammalian skin cells in vivo. In the animal studies, a contribution of UV&hyph;B to the tumor effects
could not be excluded, but the effects were greater than expected for UV&hyph;B alone (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
138
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Although some recent studies have demonstrated that UV radiation can activate HIV gene promoters (i.e., the genes
in HIV that prompt replication of the virus) in laboratory samples of human cells (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
139&hyph;144
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the implications of these in vitro findings for humans are unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1972, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published a recommended exposure limit
(REL) for occupational exposure to UV radiation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
136
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The REL is intended to protect workers from the acute effects of UV exposure (e.g., erythema and photokeratoconjunctivitis).
However, photosensitive persons and those exposed concomitantly to photoactive chemicals may not be protected
by the recommended standard. If proper procedures are not followed, HCWs performing maintenance on such fixtures
are at risk for exposure to UV radiation. Because UV fixtures used for upper-room air irradiation are present in rooms,
rather than hidden in ducts, safety may be much more difficult to achieve and maintain. Fixtures must be designed and
installed to ensure that UV exposure to persons in the room (including HCWs and inpatients) are below current safe
exposure levels. Recent health hazard evaluations conducted by CDC have noted problems with overexposure of HCWs
to UVGI and with inadequate maintenance, training, labelling, and use of personal protective equipment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
145&hyph;147
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current number of persons who are properly trained in UVGI system design and installation is limited. CDC strongly
recommends that a competent UVGI system designer be consulted to address safety considerations before such a system
is procured and installed. Experts who might be consulted include industrial hygienists, engineers, and health
physicists. Principles for the safe installation of UV lamp fixtures have been developed and can be used as guidelines
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
148,149
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If UV lamps are being used in a facility, the general TB education of HCWs should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The basic principles of UVGI systems (i.e., how they work and what their limitations are). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The potential hazardous effects of UVGI if overexposure occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The potential for photosensitivity associated with certain medical conditions or use of some medications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The importance of general maintenance procedures for UVGI fixtures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to UV intensities above the REL should be avoided. Lightweight clothing made of tightly woven fabric and
UV-absorbing sunscreens with solar-protection factors (SPFs) "15 may help protect photosensitive persons. HCWs
should be advised that any eye or skin irritation that develops after UV exposure should be examined by occupational
health staff.

D. Exposure Criteria for UV Radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NIOSH REL for UV radiation is wavelength dependent because different wavelengths of UV radiation have different
adverse effects on the skin and eyes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
136
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Relative spectral effectiveness (S
<!-- PJG 0037 unknown -->
) is used to compare various UV sources with a source producing UV radiation at 270 nm, the wavelength of maximum ocular
sensitivity. For example, the S
<!-- PJG 0037 unknown -->
 at 254 nm is 0.5; therefore, twice as much energy is required at 254 nm to produce an identical biologic effect at 270
nm (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
136
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Thus, at 254 nm, the NIOSH REL is 0.006 joules per square centimeter (J/cm2); and at 270 nm, it is 0.003 J/cm2.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For germicidal lamps that emit radiant energy predominantly at a wavelength of 254 nm, proper use of the REL requires
that the measured irradiance level (E) in microwatts per square centimeter (&mu;W/cm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. Labelling and Posting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Warning signs should be posted on UV lamps and wherever high-intensity (i.e., UV exposure greater than the REL) germicidal
UV irradiation is present (e.g., upper-room air space and accesses to ducts [if duct irradiation is used]) to alert
maintenance staff or other HCWs of the hazard. Some examples are shown below:

2. Maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the intensity of UV lamps fluctuates as they age, a schedule for replacing the lamps should be developed. The
schedule can be determined from either a time/use log or a system based on cumulative time. The tube should be checked
periodically for dust build-up, which lessens the output of UVGI. If the tube is dirty, it should be allowed to cool,
then cleaned with a damp cloth. Tubes should be replaced if they stop glowing or if they flicker to an objectionable
extent. Maintenance personnel must turn off all UV tubes before entering the upper part of the room or before accessing
ducts for any purpose. Only a few seconds of direct exposure to the intense UV radiation in the upper-room air space
or in ducts can cause burns. Protective equipment (e.g., gloves and goggles [and/or face shields]) should be worn
if exposure greater than the recommended standard is anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks of UVGI tubes can be installed in ventilating ducts. Safety devices should be used on access doors to eliminate
hazard to maintenance personnel. For duct irradiation systems, the access door for servicing the lamps should have
an inspection window* through which the lamps are checked periodically for dust build-up and malfunctioning. The
access door should have a warning sign written in languages appropriate for maintenance personnel to alert them to
the health hazard of looking directly at bare tubes. The lock for this door should have an automatic electric switch
or other device that turns off the lamps when the door is opened.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two types of fixtures are used in upper-room air irradiation: wall-mounted fixtures that have louvers to block downward
radiation and ceiling-mounted fixtures that have baffles to block radiation below the horizontal plane of the UV
tube. The actual UV tube in either type of fixture must not be visible from any normal position in the room. Light switches
that can be locked should be used, if possible, to prevent injury to personnel who might unintentionally turn the lamps
on during maintenance procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most applications, properly shielding the UV lamps to provide protection from most, if not all, of the direct UV
radiation is not difficult. However, radiation reflected from glass, polished metal, and high-gloss ceramic paints
can be harmful to persons in the room, particularly if more than one UV lamp is in use. Surfaces in irradiated rooms that
can reflect UVGI into occupied areas of the room should be covered with non-UV reflecting material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regularly scheduled evaluation of the UV intensity to which HCWs, patients, and others are exposed should be conducted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UV measurements should be made in various locations within a room using a detector designed to be most sensitive at
254 nm. Equipment used to measure germicidal UV radiation should be maintained and calibrated on a regular schedule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new UV installation must be carefully checked for hot spots (i.e., areas of the room where the REL is exceeded) by an
industrial hygienist or other person knowledgeable in making UV measurements. UV radiation levels should not exceed
those in the recommended guidelines.

Supplement 4: Respiratory Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Considerations for Selection of Respirators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal respiratory protection should be used by (a) persons entering rooms where patients with known or suspected
infectious TB are being isolated, (b) persons present during cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures
performed on such patients, and (c) persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls are
not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei. These other settings should be identified
on the basis of the facility's risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although data regarding the effectiveness of respiratory protection from many hazardous airborne materials have
been collected, the precise level of effectiveness in protecting HCWs from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transmission in health-care settings has not been determined. Information concerning the transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is incomplete. Neither the smallest infectious dose of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nor the highest level of exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at which transmission will not occur has been defined conclusively (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
59,151,152
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Furthermore, the size distribution of droplet nuclei and the number of particles containing viable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that are expelled by infectious TB patients have not been defined adequately, and accurate methods of measuring the
concentration of infectious droplet nuclei in a room have not been developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, in certain settings the administrative and engineering controls may not adequately protect HCWs
from airborne droplet nuclei (e.g., in TB isolation rooms, treatment rooms in which cough-inducing or aerosol-generating
procedures are performed, and ambulances during the transport of infectious TB patients). Respiratory protective
devices used in these settings should have characteristics that are suitable for the organism they are protecting
against and the settings in which they are used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respiratory protective devices used in health-care settings for protection against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should meet the following standard criteria. These criteria are based on currently available information, including
(a) data on the effectiveness of respiratory protection against noninfectious hazardous materials in workplaces
other than health-care settings and on an interpretation of how these data can be applied to respiratory protection
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; (b) data on the efficiency of respirator filters in filtering biological aerosols; (c) data on face-seal leakage;
and (d) data on the characteristics of respirators that were used in conjunction with administrative and engineering
controls in outbreak settings where transmission to HCWs and patients was terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The ability to filter particles 1 um in size in the unloaded state with a filter efficiency of "95% (i.e., filter leakage
of &gt;5%), given flow rates of up to 50 L per minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available data suggest that infectious droplet nuclei range in size from 1 &mu;m to 5 &mu;m; therefore, respirators
used in health-care settings should be able to efficiently filter the smallest particles in this range. Fifty liters
per minute is a reasonable estimate of the highest airflow rate an HCW is likely to achieve during breathing, even while
performing strenuous work activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively fit tested in a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of &gt;10%
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
54,55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The ability to fit the different facial sizes and characteristics of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the
respirators available in at least three sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in accordance with OSHA standards and good industrial hygiene practice,
by HCWs each time they put on their respirators (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
54,55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some settings, HCWs may be at risk for two types of exposure: (a) inhalation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (b) mucous membrane exposure to fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In these settings, protection
against both types of exposure should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may have
infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW should serve two functions: (a) it should protect the surgical
field from the respiratory secretions of the HCW and (b) it should protect the HCW from infectious droplet nuclei that
may be expelled by the patient or generated by the procedure. Respirators with expiration valves and positive-pressure
respirators do not protect the sterile field; therefore, a respirator that does not have a valve and that meets the
criteria in Supplement 4, Section I.A, should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Specific Respirators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OSHA respiratory protection standard requires that all respiratory protective devices used in the workplace
be certified by NIOSH.* NIOSH-approved HEPA respirators are the only currently available air-purifying respirators
that meet or exceed the standard performance criteria stated above. However, the NIOSH certification procedures
are currently being revised (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
153
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Under the proposed revision, filter materials would be tested at a flow rate of 85 L/min for penetration by particles
with a median aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 &mu;m and, if certified, would be placed in one of the following categories:
type A, which has "99.97% efficiency (similar to current HEPA filter media); type B, "99% efficiency; or type C, "95%
efficiency. According to this proposed scheme, type C filter material would meet or exceed the standard performance
criteria specified in this document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited number of selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed
on patients suspected of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having had active TB at the
time of death) where the estimated risk for transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be such that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria is appropriate. In such circumstances,
a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria and compatible with patient-care delivery (e.g.,
negative-pressure respirators that are more protective; powered air-purifying particulate respirators [PAPRs];
or positive-pressure airline, half-mask respirators) should be provided by employers to HCWs who are exposed to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Information on these and other respirators may be found in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

C. The Effectiveness of Respiratory Protective Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following information, which is based on experience with respiratory protection in the industrial setting,
summarizes the available data about the effectiveness of respiratory protection against hazardous airborne materials.
Data regarding protection against transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parameters used to determine the effectiveness of a respiratory protective device are face-seal efficacy and
filter efficacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Face-Seal Leakage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Face-seal leakage compromises the ability of particulate respirators to protect HCWs from airborne materials (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
154&hyph;156
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). A proper seal between the respirator's sealing surface and the face of the person wearing the respirator is essential
for effective and reliable performance of any negative-pressure respirator. This seal is less critical, but still
important, for positive-pressure respirators. Face-seal leakage can result from various factors, including incorrect
facepiece size or shape, incorrect or defective facepiece sealing-lip, beard growth, perspiration or facial oils
that can cause facepiece slippage, failure to use all the head straps, incorrect positioning of the facepiece on the
face, incorrect head strap tension or position, improper respirator maintenance, and respirator damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every time a person wearing a negative-pressure particulate respirator inhales, a negative pressure (relative
to the workplace air) is created inside the facepiece. Because of this negative pressure, air containing contaminants
can take a path of least resistance into the respirator_through leaks at the face-seal interface_thus avoiding the
higher-resistance filter material. Currently available, cup-shaped, disposable particulate respirators have
from 0 to 20% face-seal leakage (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
55,154
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This face-seal leakage results from the variability of the human face and from limitations in the respirator's
design, construction, and number of sizes available. The face-seal leakage is probably higher if the respirator
is not fitted properly to the HCW's face, tested for an adequate fit by a qualified person, and then checked for fit by
the HCW every time the respirator is put on. Face-seal leakage may be reduced to less than &lt;10% with improvements
in design, a greater variety in available sizes, and appropriate fit testing and fit checking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison with negative-pressure respirators, positive-pressure respirators produce a positive pressure
inside the facepiece under most conditions of use. For example, in a PAPR, a blower forcibly draws ambient air through
HEPA filters, then delivers the filtered air to the facepiece. This air is blown into the facepiece at flow rates that
generally exceed the expected inhalation flow rates. The positive pressure inside the facepiece reduces face-seal
leakage to low levels, particularly during the relatively low inhalation rates expected in health-care settings.
PAPRs with a tight-fitting facepiece have &lt;2% face-seal leakage under routine conditions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Powered-air respirators with loose-fitting facepieces, hoods, or helmets have &lt;4% face-seal leakage under
routine conditions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Thus, a PAPR may offer lower levels of face-seal leakage than nonpowered, half-mask respirators. Full facepiece,
nonpowered respirators have the same leakage (i.e., &lt;2%) as PAPRs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another factor contributing to face-seal leakage of cup-shaped, disposable respirators is that some of these respirators
are available in only one size. A single size may produce higher leakage for persons who have smaller or difficult-to-fit
faces (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
157
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The facepieces used for some reusable (including HEPA and replaceable filter, negative-pressure) and all positive-pressure
particulate air-purifying respirators are available in as many as three different sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Filter Leakage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aerosol leakage through respirator filters depends on at least five independent variables: (a) the filtration characteristics
for each type of filter, (b) the size distribution of the droplets in the aerosol, (c) the linear velocity through the
filtering material, (d) the filter loading (i.e., the amount of contaminant deposited on the filter), and (e) any
electrostatic charges on the filter and on the droplets in the aerosol (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
158
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When HEPA filters are used in particulate air-purifying respirators, filter efficiency is so high (i.e., effectively
100%) that filter leakage is not a consideration. Therefore, for all HEPA-filter respirators, virtually all inward
leakage of droplet nuclei occurs at the respirator's face seal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Fit Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fit testing is part of the respiratory protection program required by OSHA for all respiratory protective devices
used in the workplace. A fit test determines whether a respiratory protective device adequately fits a particular
HCW. The HCW may need to be fit tested with several devices to determine which device offers the best fit. However, fit
tests can detect only the leakage that occurs at the time of the fit testing, and the tests cannot distinguish face-seal
leakage from filter leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination of facepiece fit can involve qualitative or quantitative tests (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). A qualitative test relies on the subjective response of the HCW being fit tested. A quantitative test uses detectors
to measure inward leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposable, negative-pressure particulate respirators can be qualitatively fit tested with aerosolized substances
that can be tasted, although the results of this testing are limited because the tests depend on the subjective response
of the HCW being tested. Quantitative fit testing of disposable negative-pressure particulate respirators can
best be performed if the manufacturer provides a test respirator with a probe for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Replaceable filter, negative-pressure particulate respirators and all positive-pressure particulate respirators
can be fit tested reliably, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when fitted with HEPA filters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Fit Checking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A fit check is a maneuver that an HCW performs before each use of the respiratory protective device to check the fit.
The fit check can be performed according to the manufacturer's facepiece fitting instructions by using the applicable
negative-pressure or positive-pressure test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some currently available cup-shaped, disposable negative-pressure particulate respirators cannot be fit checked
reliably by persons wearing the devices because occluding the entire surface of the filter is difficult. Strategies
for overcoming these limitations are being developed by respirator manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Reuse of Respirators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conscientious respirator maintenance should be an integral part of an overall respirator program. This maintenance
applies both to respirators with replaceable filters and respirators that are classified as disposable but that
are reused. Manufacturers' instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining respirators should be followed
to ensure that the respirator continues to function properly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When respirators are used for protection against noninfectious aerosols (e.g., wood dust), which may be present
in the air in heavy concentrations, the filter material may become occluded with airborne material. This occlusion
may result in an uncomfortable breathing resistance. In health-care settings where respirators are used for protection
against biological aerosols, the concentration of infectious particles in the air is probably low; thus, the filter
material in a respirator is very unlikely to become occluded with airborne material. In addition, there is no evidence
that particles impacting on the filter material in a respirator are re-aerosolized easily. For these reasons, the
filter material used in respirators in the health-care setting should remain functional for weeks to months. Respirators
with replaceable filters are reusable, and a respirator classified as disposable may be reused by the same HCW as long
as it remains functional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before each use, the outside of the filter material should be inspected. If the filter material is physically damaged
or soiled, the filter should be changed (in the case of respirators with replaceable filters) or the respirator discarded
(in the case of disposable respirators). Infection-control personnel should develop standard operating procedures
for storing, reusing, and disposing of respirators that have been designated as disposable and for disposing of replaceable
filter elements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Implementing a Personal Respiratory Protection Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If personal respiratory protection is used in a health-care setting, OSHA requires that an effective personal respiratory
protection program be developed, implemented, administered, and periodically reevaluated (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
54,55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All HCWs who need to use respirators for protection against infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
should be included in the respiratory protection program. Visitors to TB patients should be given respirators to
wear while in isolation rooms, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of HCWs included in the respiratory protection program in each facility will vary depending on (a) the number
of potentially infectious TB patients, (b) the number of rooms or areas to which patients with suspected or confirmed
infectious TB are admitted, and (c) the number of HCWs needed in these rooms or areas. Where respiratory protection
programs are required, they should include enough HCWs to provide adequate care for a patient with known or suspected
TB should such a patient be admitted to the facility. However, administrative measures should be used to limit the
number of HCWs who need to enter these rooms or areas, thus limiting the number of HCWs who need to be included in the respiratory
protection program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information regarding the development and management of a respiratory protection program is available in technical
training courses that cover the basics of personal respiratory protection. Such courses are offered by various organizations,
such as NIOSH, OSHA, and the American Industrial Hygiene Association. Similar courses are available from private
contractors and universities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be effective and reliable, respiratory protection programs must contain at least the following elements (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
55,154
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assignment of responsibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Supervisory responsibility for the respiratory protection program should be assigned to designated persons who
have expertise in issues relevant to the program, including infectious diseases and occupational health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard operating procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written standard operating procedures should contain information concerning all aspects of the respiratory protection
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Medical screening. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCWs should not be assigned a task requiring use of respirators unless they are physically able to perform the task
while wearing the respirator. HCWs should be screened for pertinent medical conditions at the time they are hired,
then rescreened periodically (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The screening could occur as infrequently as every 5 years. The screening process should begin with a general screening
(e.g., a questionnaire) for pertinent medical conditions, and the results of the screening should then be used to
identify HCWs who need further evaluation. Routine physical examination or testing with chest radiographs or spirometry
is not necessary or required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Few medical conditions preclude the use of most negative-pressure particulate respirators. HCWs who have mild pulmonary
or cardiac conditions may report discomfort with breathing when wearing negative-pressure particulate respirators,
but these respirators are unlikely to have adverse health effects on the HCWs. Those HCWs who have more severe cardiac
or pulmonary conditions may have more difficulty than HCWs with similar but milder conditions if performing duties
while wearing negative-pressure respirators. Furthermore, these HCWs may be unable to use some PAPRs because of
the added weight of these respirators.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

HCWs who wear respirators and the persons who supervise them should be informed about the necessity for wearing respirators
and the potential risks associated with not doing so. This training should also include at a minimum:

Face-seal fit testing and fit checking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCWs should undergo fit testing to identify a respirator that adequately fits each individual HCW. The HCW should
receive fitting instructions that include demonstrations and practice in how the respirator should be worn, how
it should be adjusted, and how to determine if it fits properly. The HCW should be taught to check the facepiece fit before
each use.

Respirator inspection, cleaning, maintenance, and storage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conscientious respirator maintenance should be an integral part of an overall respirator program. This maintenance
applies both to respirators with replaceable filters and respirators that are classified as disposable but that
are reused. Manufacturers' instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining respirators should be followed
to ensure that the respirator continues to function properly (

Periodic evaluation of the personal respiratory protection program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program should be evaluated completely at least once a year, and both the written operating procedures and program
administration should be revised as necessary based on the results of the evaluation. Elements of the program that
should be evaluated include work practices and employee acceptance of respirator use (i.e., subjective comments
made by employees concerning comfort during use and interference with duties).

Supplement 5: Decontamination_Cleaning, Disinfecting, and Sterilizing of Patient-Care Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Equipment used on patients who have TB is usually not involved in the transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
although transmission by contaminated bronchoscopes has been demonstrated (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
159,160
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Guidelines for cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing equipment have been published (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
161,162
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The rationale for cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing patient-care equipment can be understood more readily
if medical devices, equipment, and surgical materials are divided into three general categories. These categories_critical,
semicritical, and noncritical items_are defined by the potential risk for infection associated with their use (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
163,164
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Critical items 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are instruments that are introduced directly into the bloodstream or into other normally sterile areas of the body
(e.g., needles, surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, and implants). These items should be sterile at the time
of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Semicritical items 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are those that may come in contact with mucous membranes but do not ordinarily penetrate body surfaces (e.g., noninvasive
flexible and rigid fiberoptic endoscopes or bronchoscopes, endotracheal tubes, and anesthesia breathing circuits).
Although sterilization is preferred for these instruments, high-level disinfection that destroys vegetative
microorganisms, most fungal spores, tubercle bacilli, and small nonlipid viruses may be used. Meticulous physical
cleaning of such items before sterilization or high-level disinfection is essential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncritical items 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are those that either do not ordinarily touch the patient or touch only the patient's intact skin (e.g., crutches,
bedboards, blood pressure cuffs, and various other medical accessories). These items are not associated with direct
transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and washing them with detergent is usually sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health-care facility policies should specify whether cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing an item is necessary
to decrease the risk for infection. Decisions about decontamination processes should be based on the intended use
of the item, not on the diagnosis of the patient for whom the item was used. Selection of chemical disinfectants depends
on the intended use, the level of disinfection required, and the structure and material of the item to be disinfected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although microorganisms are ordinarily found on walls, floors, and other environmental surfaces, these surfaces
are rarely associated with transmission of infections to patients or HCWs. This is particularly true with organisms
such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which generally require inhalation by the host for infection to occur. Therefore, extraordinary attempts to disinfect
or sterilize environmental surfaces are not indicated. If a detergent germicide is used for routine cleaning, a hospital-grade,
EPA-approved germicide/disinfectant that is not tuberculocidal can be used. The same routine daily cleaning procedures
used in other rooms in the facility should be used to clean TB isolation rooms, and personnel should follow isolation
practices while cleaning these rooms. For final cleaning of the isolation room after a patient has been discharged,
personal protective equipment is not necessary if the room has been ventilated for the appropriate amount of time
(Table S3&hyph;1).

This glossary contains many of the terms used in the guidelines, as well as others that are encountered frequently
by persons who implement TB infection-control programs. The definitions given are not dictionary definitions but
are those most applicable to usage relating to TB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acid-fast bacilli (AFB): Bacteria that retain certain dyes after being washed in an acid solution. Most acid-fast
organisms are mycobacteria. When AFB are seen on a stained smear of sputum or other clinical specimen, a diagnosis
of TB should be suspected; however, the diagnosis of TB is not confirmed until a culture is grown and identified as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adherence: Refers to the behavior of patients when they follow all aspects of the treatment regimen as prescribed
by the medical provider, and also refers to the behavior of HCWs and employers when they follow all guidelines pertaining
to infection control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aerosol: The droplet nuclei that are expelled by an infectious person (e.g., by coughing or sneezing); these droplet
nuclei can remain suspended in the air and can transmit M. tuberculosis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to other persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air changes: The ratio of the volume of air flowing through a space in a certain period of time (i.e., the airflow rate)
to the volume of that space (i.e., the room volume); this ratio is usually expressed as the number of air changes per
hour (ACH). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air mixing: The degree to which air supplied to a room mixes with the air already in the room, usually expressed as a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
mixing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
factor. This factor varies from 1 (for perfect mixing) to 10 (for poor mixing), and it is used as a multiplier to determine
the actual airflow required (i.e., the recommended ACH multiplied by the mixing factor equals the actual ACH required).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alveoli: The small air sacs in the lungs that lie at the end of the bronchial tree; the site where carbon dioxide in the
blood is replaced by oxygen from the lungs and where TB infection usually begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anergy; The inability of a person to react to skin-test antigens (even if the person is infected with the organisms
tested) because of immunosuppression. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anteroom: A small room leading from a corridor into an isolation room; this room can act as an airlock, preventing the
escape of contaminants from the isolation room into the corridor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area: A structural unit (e.g., a hospital ward or laboratory) or functional unit (e.g., an internal medicine service)
in which HCWs provide services to and share air with a specific patient population or work with clinical specimens
that may contain viable

DNA probe: A technique that allows rapid and precise identification of mycobacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. bovis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that are grown in culture. The identification can often be completed in 2 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Droplet nuclei: Microscopic particles (i.e., 1&hyph;5 &mu;m in diameter) produced when a person coughs, sneezes,
shouts, or sings. The droplets produced by an infectious TB patient can carry tubercle bacilli and can remain suspended
in the air for prolonged periods of time and be carried on normal air currents in the room.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drug resistance, acquired: A resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs that develops while a patient is receiving therapy
and which usually results from the patient's nonadherence to therapy or the prescription of an inadequate regimen
by a health-care provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drug resistance, primary: A resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs the exists before a patient is treated with the

susceptible or resistant to various anti-TB drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethambutol: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug sometimes used concomitantly with INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fluorochrome stain: A technique for staining a clinical specimen with fluorescent dyes to perform a microscopic
examination (smear) for mycobacteria. This technique is preferable to other staining techniques because the mycobacteria
can be seen easily and the slides can be read quickly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fomites: Linens, books, dishes, or other objects used or touched by a patient. These objects are not involved in the
transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gastric aspirate: A procedure sometimes used to obtain a specimen for culture when a patient cannot cough up adequate
sputum. A tube is inserted through the mouth or nose and into the stomach to recover sputum that was coughed into the
throat and then swallowed. This procedure is particularly useful for diagnosis in children, who are often unable
to cough up sputum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: A specialized filter that is capable of removing 99.97% of particles
"0.3 &mu;m in diameter and that may assist in controlling the transmission of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Filters may be used in ventilation systems to remove particles from the air or in personal respirators to filter air

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. No data are available regarding whether these persons are also at increased risk for infection with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 after they have been exposed to the organism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Induration: An area of swelling produced by an immune response to an antigen. In tuberculin skin testing or anergy
testing, the diameter of the indurated area is measured 48&hyph;72 hours after the injection, and the result is recorded
in millimeters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infection: The condition in which organisms capable of causing disease (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

) enter the body and elicit a response from the host's immune defenses. TB infection may or may not lead to clinical disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infectious: Capable of transmitting infection. When persons who have clinically active pulmonary or laryngeal
TB disease cough or sneeze, they can expel droplets containing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. tuberculosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 into the air. Persons whose sputum smears are positive for AFB are probably infectious.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Injectable: A medication that is usually administered by injection into the muscle (intramuscular [IM]) or the bloodstream
(intravenous [IV]).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intermittent therapy: Therapy administered either two or three times per week, rather than daily. Intermittent
therapy should be administered only under the direct supervision of an HCW or other designated person (see Directly
observed therapy [DOT]).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small dose of tuberculin (PPD) is injected just beneath the surface of the skin, and the area is examined 48&hyph;72
hours after the injection. A reaction is measured according to the size of the induration. The classification of a
reaction as positive or negative depends on the patient's medical history and various risk factors (see Mantoux test).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smear (AFB smear): A laboratory technique for visualizing mycobacteria. The specimen is smeared onto a slide and
stained, then examined using a microscope. Smear results should be available within 24 hours. In TB, a large number
of mycobacteria seen on an AFB smear usually indicates infectiousness. However, a positive result is not diagnostic
of TB because organisms other than

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sputum induction: A method used to obtain sputum from a patient who is unable to cough up a specimen spontaneously.
The patient inhales a saline mist, which stimulates a cough from deep within the lungs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sputum smear, positive: AFB are visible on the sputum smear when viewed under a microscope. Persons with a sputum smear
positive for AFB are considered more infectious than those with smear-negative sputum.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TB infection: A condition in which living tubercle bacilli are present in the body but the disease is not clinically
active. Infected persons usually have positive tuberculin reactions, but they have no symptoms related to the infection
and are not infectious. However, infected persons remain at lifelong risk for developing disease unless preventive
therapy is given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Two-step testing: A procedure used for the baseline testing of persons who will periodically receive tuberculin
skin tests (e.g., HCWs) to reduce the likelihood of mistaking a boosted reaction for a new infection. If the initial
tuberculin-test result is classified as negative, a second test is repeated 1&hyph;3 weeks later. If the reaction
to the second test is positive, it probably represents a boosted reaction. If the second test result is also negative,
the person is classified as not infected. A positive reaction to a subsequent test would indicate new infection (i.e.,
a skin-test conversion) in such a person.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes absolute priorities and a competitive preference priority under the Jacob K. Javits Gifted
and Talented Students Education Program. The Secretary takes this action to focus Federal financial assistance
on specific approaches to identifying and serving gifted and talented students and to developing ways in which the
programs and services developed for gifted and talented students can be used to benefit all children. The priorities
bring special attention to programs and services for students (including economically disadvantaged individuals,
individuals of limited-English proficiency, and individuals with disabilities) who may not be identified and served
through traditional gifted and talented programs. The priorities also encourage programs and projects to develop
and improve the capability of schools in an entire State or region of the Nation through cooperative efforts and participation
of State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and other public and private agencies
and organizations, such as business, industry, and labor, to plan, conduct, and improve programs in schools using,
where appropriate, methods and materials developed in gifted and talented programs to improve the educational opportunities
for all children.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program is designed to build nationwide capability in
gifted and talented education and encourage rich and challenging curricula for all children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary seeks to improve the education of gifted and talented children, and to use the strategies developed
in gifted and talented education programs to improve the education of all children in a school. The Secretary believes
that this is an integral part of the National Education Goals, which require that every student attain higher standards
of academic excellence. Gifted and talented education programs can contribute to systemic reform by modeling a coordinated
system of high standards, assessments, challenging curricula, and teacher preparation to improve education. In
addition, the Secretary believes that the educational needs of gifted and talented students from populations historically
underserved by gifted and talented education programs must be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to carry out these improvements, the Secretary proposes a priority that would support the development of
model demonstration programs that focus on economically disadvantaged children, children with limited English
proficiency or children with disabilities. The projects will be required to involve a school or schools that serve
at least 50 percent low-income children and to incorporate professional development of staff and training of parents
into their programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary proposes a second priority that encourages cooperative efforts of technical assistance
and information dissemination throughout a State or region that focuses on how programs and methods for teaching
gifted and talented students, where appropriate, could be adapted to improve instruction for all students in schools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In both proposed priorities, the projects must be based on challenging content and performance standards in one or
more of the core subject areas, and include comprehensive improvement plans for the school or schools involved in
the projects. These priorities focus on projects that incorporate challenging content and performance standards
in the core subjects because the Secretary believes that this is the most promising way to raise students' achievement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary estimates that at least 75 percent of available funds will be used to support model projects in schools,
and 25 percent of available funds will support technical assistance and dissemination projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the first priority involving model programs, the Secretary proposes to direct financial assistance to projects
that primarily benefit urban or rural areas that have been designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities
in accordance with Section 1391 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as amended by Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (OBRA) of 1993.

Background on Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program is a critical element of the Administration's community revitalization
strategy. The program is the first step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities and
rural heartlands. It is designed to empower people and communities by inspiring Americans to work together to create
jobs and opportunity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this program, the Federal government will designate up to nine areas as Empowerment Zones and up to 95 areas as
Enterprise Communities in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 1311, as amended by Title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). To be eligible for designation, an area must be nominated
by one or more local governments and the State or States in which it is located or by a State-Chartered Economic Development
Corporation. A nominated area must be one of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress, and must have
a poverty rate of not less than the level specified in section 1392 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program communities are invited to submit strategic plans that
comprehensively address how the community would link economic development with education and training as well as
how community development, public safety, human services, and environmental initiatives will together support
sustainable communities. Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will be designated by the Department of
Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) based on the quality of their strategic plans.
Designated areas will receive Federal grant funds and substantial tax benefits and will have access to other Federal
programs. (For additional information on the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Community program contact HUD at
1&hyph;800&hyph;998&hyph;9999.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Education is supporting the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative in a variety
of ways. It is encouraging Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities to use funds they already receive from Department
of Education programs (including Chapter 1 of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, the Adult Education Act, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education
Act) to support the comprehensive vision of their strategic plans. In addition, the Department of Education intends
to give preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in a number of discretionary grant programs
that are well suited for inclusion in a comprehensive approach to economic and community development. In addition
to the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education program described in this notice, the Department intends to
give preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in the Urban Community Service program, National
Workplace Literacy program, the Rehabilitation Act Projects with Industry program, the Rehabilitation Act Special
Demonstration Projects program, the Parent Training program, and the Early Childhood Education program under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and a variety of discretionary programs under the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act. Notices concerning those programs will be published at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative and the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education
Program share some common features. Both programs are concerned with the educational advancement of students caught
in high-poverty communities. Under the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, at least one-half
of the grants in any given year must serve students who are economically disadvantaged, limited English proficient
or who have disabilities.

Communities who are designated under the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program will already have demonstrated
a capacity for the type of cooperative planning that allows communities to use, where appropriate, methods and materials
developed in gifted and talented programs to improve the educational opportunities for all children.
