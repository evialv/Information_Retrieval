SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule temporarily suspends a sentence in &sect;989.67(j) of the California raisin marketing order dealing
with the pricing of reserve raisins offered to handlers for free use. The industry is faced with a large supply of Zante
Currant raisins. The suspension will only apply to 1994&hyph;95 reserve Zante Currants so that the value of a portion
of the free tonnage inventory held by handlers on July 31, 1994, can be adjusted downward toward current market price
levels. This adjustment is necessary to help the industry become price competitive and to aid it in marketing Zante
Currants. This action was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is
responsible for local administration of the order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989] (order), regulating the handling of
raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule will allow the Committee
to implement an inventory price adjustment program for Zante Currents during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which began
August 1, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the order, and approximately
5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and a majority of producers of California
raisins may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the order, seasonal volume regulations can be established. The free percentages prescribe the portion of the
crop that can be shipped at any time to any market. The reserve percentages prescribe the portion of the crop that must
be held for delayed shipment. Reserve raisins are held in a reserve pool by handlers for the account of the Committee.
Funds generated from the sale of reserve pool raisins are distributed equally to equity holders (growers). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule will suspend the penultimate sentence in &sect;989.67(j) of the order for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year.
That sentence provides that: ``However, such raisins shall not be sold at a price below that which the committee concludes
reflects the average price received by producers for free tonnage of the same varietal type purchased by handlers
during the current crop year up to the time of any offer for sale of reserve tonnage by the committee, to which shall be
added the costs to the equity holders incurred by the committee on account of receiving, inspecting, storing, fumigating,
insuring, and holding of said raisins, and including costs of taxes and interest: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That, where the outlook for the next crop year or other factors have caused a downward trend in the prices received by
producers for free tonnage raisins or in the prices received by handlers for free tonnage packed raisins, reserve
tonnage may be sold to handlers at the currently prevailing or the approximate computed field price for free tonnage
raisins, as determined by the committee.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited volumes of Zante Currants are produced in California. The 1993&hyph;94 California production of Zante Currants
was 5,643 tons, which is 32 percent larger than the prior four-year average of 4,279 tons. The estimated 1994&hyph;95
production is greater than 6,500 tons or over 50 percent more than the 1989&hyph;92 four-year average. It is anticipated
that the production of Zante Currants will continue to increase in the next one to three years as newly planted acreage
begins to produce and/or reach full production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Greece is the major producer of currants, generally representing at least 85 percent of the annual world production
of such raisins. In 1992&hyph;93, Greek currants were in short supply and prices rose sharply. As a result, the market
for California Zante Currants strengthened significantly and the grower price increased to $1,600 from $1,365 per
ton the previous season. In 1993&hyph;94, the grower price for California Zante Currants was $1,200 per ton. The 1993&hyph;94
Greek currant crop was approximately 50,000 tons, of excellent quality, and prices were very competitive with those
quoted for California Zante Currants. This resulted in a significant drop in California Zante Currant shipments
here and abroad.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the California raisin industry is carrying a very large supply (approximately 4,000 tons) of 1992&hyph;93
and 1993&hyph;94 crop Zante Currants and projects a record production (approximately 6,500 tons) in 1994&hyph;95.
The trade is aware of this supply problem and forward purchases from handlers have decreased. Sales are not expected
to increase until corrective pricing action is taken by handlers. Before that can begin, however, handlers need assurance
that the value of some of their free Zante Currant inventories from the 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 production
years can be reduced to the recently established $980 per ton 1994&hyph;95 free tonnage Zante Currant field price,
thus reducing their potential losses on existing free raisin inventory. Suspending the penultimate sentence in
&sect;989.67(j) can assure this protection, as it will allow the Committee to sell 1994 crop reserve tonnage to handlers
for free use at a lower price than the established field price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee plans to offer handlers one ton of 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currant reserve raisins at $100 per ton for
every four tons of free Zante Currants held by them on July 31, 1994. Purchasing free tonnage 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante
Currants at $980 per ton and reserve Zante Currants at $100 per ton in accordance with this formula will allow handlers'
inventories to achieve an approximate net value of $980 per ton. In the absence of the suspension, these price adjustments
could not be accomplished. In the absence of such adjustments, the industry could not compete effectively with foreign-produced
currants without substantial losses on the part of packers and producers. Moreover, a significant loss in foreign
markets could result. A loss of domestic markets to foreign imports could also result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recommending its action, the Committee recognized that it would be selling a portion of the reserve raisins at a
price well below the cost of producing raisins, and that the net proceeds to equity holders would be quite low. In the
absence of this action, open price contracting between producers and handlers on 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currant
deliveries was a possibility because of the excess supplies and inflated value of the inventory. On the basis of the
Committee's recommendation, handlers did not use open price contracting but instead in negotiations with the Raisin
Bargaining Association (Association) agreed to pay producers the aforementioned $980 per ton price for free tonnage
Zante Currants. Without the inventory adjustment program, very low prices for all 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currants
were likely. The Association is a cooperative which bargains sales terms with independent handlers on behalf of its
producer members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recognized that the effects of this action on individual entities will vary depending on their financial conditions
and their equities in the reserve pool. However, the impact is not expected to be significant. In the long term, the
benefits of becoming more competitive under current marketing conditions should outweigh any adverse short-term
impact and result in benefits to all industry entities. The domestic inventory price adjustment accomplished through
this action will permit an overall price reduction for handlers' sales of Zante Currants, enabling the industry to
compete more effectively with lower-priced foreign-produced currants, and to more aggressively market Zante Currants
in the interest of maintaining and expanding existing domestic and foreign markets and in developing new markets.
The net result of this action is likely to be positive as a result of increased marketings of Zante Currants at reduced
prices. On the basis of all of the foregoing, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee, it is determined that: (1) There has been a change of economic or marketing conditions to warrant
the sale of Zante Currant reserve raisins to handlers to provide them with raisins to sell as free tonnage, pursuant
to section 989.67(j), and (2) under the conditions presently existing in the raisin industry, the penultimate sentence
in section 989.67(j) does not now tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act and is hereby suspended with regard
to Zante Currants pursuant to section 989.91(b). However, such suspension shall continue only through July 31, 1995,
at which time it shall terminate and the suspended sentence will become operative again beginning August 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good
cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) Producers and handlers have been conducting their marketing operations on the premise that the value
of the 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 Zante Currants carried into the 1994&hyph;95 season would be averaged down
to the 1994&hyph;95 negotiated free tonnage price; (2) the Committee met on October 5, 1994, and computed and announced
preliminary free and reserve tonnage percentages for Zante Currant raisins; (3) prompt implementation of this action
is necessary to prevent disruption in the marketplace; and (4) the industry is aware of this action, which was unanimously
recommended by the Committee at a public meeting.

 This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice
Reform. This rule: (1) Will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies; (2) Will not have any retroactive
effect; and (3) Will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions
of this rule.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Administrator certifies that this action would not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on current and historical funding levels for this program and a projected average size loan and/or grant in
the range of $300,000 to $400,000, it is estimated that 50 to 60 loans and/or grants will be made nationwide each year
under the existing rule. Applicants whose rural development projects are enhanced by this action are projected to
be less numerous, and therefore, the rule will have a limited impact upon small businesses. Since credit will be channeled
to areas which are generally underdeveloped and financially depressed, job creation and economic development resulting
from newly emerging businesses and community facilities funded by REA will not pose undue competition or other adverse
effects upon existing businesses. Therefore, this rule will have no effect upon businesses or entities other than
those to be funded through this program.

as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). Therefore, this action does not
require an environmental impact statement or assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials, with the exception of applications for Project Feasibility Studies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 15, 1989, REA published the final rule, 7 CFR 1709, subpart B, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 6867) that implemented the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, also known as the Cushion of Credit
Payments Program, established by Section 313 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (Act). This program
provides funds to Act borrowers for the promotion of rural economic development and job creation projects. On September
27, 1990, REA changed the designation of this rule from 7 CFR part 1709 to part 1703 (55 FR 39393) and on September 25,
1992, published an amendment (57 FR 44314) to refine and improve the structure of the rule. On March 14, 1994, REA published
a final rule (59 FR 11702) establishing procedures to approve and administer grants and grants in conjunction with
zero-interest loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 28, 1994, a proposed rule was published (59 FR 38378) to amend the rule to enhance the funding potential of Rural
Economic Development Loan and Grant Program (REDLGP) applications from economically devastated areas. This constitutes
the finalization of that proposed rule.

Synopsis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administrator will have the discretion to designate special economic status under the REDLGP selection
factors, adding up to 25 points to an applicant's score if at least one of the four conditions outlined in &sect;1703.46(g)(7)
has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The prohibition on funding community antenna television systems or facilities has been reinstated except
in special cases as outlined in &sect;1703.17(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The provision for disbursement of grant funds has been revised to allow REA Borrowers with limited financial
resources, or for other reasons, to receive funds based on invoices from project owners rather than committing their
own funds under the reimbursement provision. This arrangement will require prior REA approval. See &sect;1703.22(e).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The definition of ``Rural economic development'' has been revised to clarify REA policy on funding projects
located outside rural areas as defined in Section 13 of the Rural Electrification (RE) Act but which provide significant
benefits to rural areas.

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA received seven comments regarding this regulation, which were taken into consideration in preparing this final
rule. Comments were received from the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Minnesota Rural Electric Association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Riverside County Economic Development Agency, Riverside, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) City of Hollister, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Maine Ambulatory Care Coalition, Manchester, Maine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Crown Economic Development Corporation, Hanford, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Merced County Board of Supervisors, Merced, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Community Development Division, Fresno, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the comments received, one commenter suggested that REA accept ``local'' unemployment data, if available, instead
of county-wide data because of significant variances in larger counties. We recognize that large geographical counties
are at a disadvantage if only countywide data is accepted. Therefore the use, where appropriate, of State-published
information, would be a reasonable alternative and have amended &sect;1703.46(g)(7)(iii) is hereby amended to
allow the REA Administrator to consider State-published statistics, provided by the applicant, in those situations
where the Census material is clearly not representative of the project location. However, the data must be verifiable
and part of a recognized database which reflects information for other areas within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One community expressed concern that requiring disbursement of funds up front and awaiting reimbursement could
be a hardship on small rural communities. However, this requirement does not actually impact community government
entities because the reimbursement policy is applicable only in cases where REA Borrowers receive grants to establish
revolving loan funds. This final rule provides special arrangements only for REA Borrowers establishing revolving
loan funds, who are unable to fund projects using the reimbursement method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment was that REA's definition of ``rural'' in this rule was too broad and would allow reviewers to fund
projects not directly benefiting rural communities. The commenter suggested that the funds either be restricted
to the 2500 population limit or controlled by organizations from such communities, that at least 70 percent of the
funds be spent in communities under 2500 and that the urban entity provide at least 60 percent in matching funds. All
REDLGP applications are reviewed by the REA staff and selected based on the evaluation criteria outlined in &sect;1703.46,
much of which is based on benefit to rural areas. Moreover, REA borrowers serve primarily rural areas, and they are
well-suited to determine that the final benefits are directed toward the local community. As discussed previously
in this preamble, the rule has been revised to allow projects which are not located in rural areas. However, those projects
must result in significant benefit to rural areas.

Another recommendation was to assign bonus points to areas ``nominated'' by State and local governments for designation
as Rural Empowerment Zones or Rural Enterprise Communities as well as those areas primarily designated by USDA as
Rural Empowerment Zones or Rural Enterprise Communities. It was suggested that these communities be rewarded for
the development of the plans and partnerships required by the nominating process and receive a portion of the points
they would have received if actually designated as Rural Empowerment Zones or Rural Enterprise Communities. REA
recognizes that community strategic planning is a key component of the Empowerment initiative, however, this additional
planning aspect will directly benefit the communities in other ways such as allowing them to realize and unlock their
own potential to partnership with the private sector and other federal and state entities. The strategic planning
process also improves the applicant's overall REDLGP application which should be reflected under the normal evaluation
criteria.

with &sect;1703.46 of this subpart. Notwithstanding this, the Administrator reserves the right to deny any proposal
for community antenna television systems or facilities. Community antenna television systems or facilities will
be considered for funding in accordance with &sect;1703.46 of this subpart and this section only when all of the following
conditions exist:

Disbursement of grant funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Borrowers are not authorized to commence projects to be funded under this section until those projects have been submitted
for authorization in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the projects have been submitted for authorization
subsequent to grant approval in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. REA grant funds will be disbursed
on a reimbursement basis. However, upon written justification by borrowers and approval by the Administrator, borrowers
unable to fund projects under reimbursement provisions, for financial or other extraordinary reasons, may receive
grant funds under the special disbursement method by submitting unpaid invoices from project owners, and grant funds
will be disbursed to borrowers and passed directly to project owners. In either case, REA grant funds will be disbursed
in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR Part 3015, Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations, the applicable requirements
of this subpart, the administrative provisions outlined in paragraph (g) of this section, and the following requirements:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Only projects authorized by REA in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, for which adequate
documentation is submitted, including receipts for expenditures under the reimbursement method or unpaid invoices
under the special disbursement method, as applicable, and certification of approved purposes, will be considered
for disbursement;

* * * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Under the reimbursement method, grant funds requisitioned for individual projects in increments of less than
$100,000, or less than 25 percent of the amount approved for the revolving loan fund, whichever is less, may be disbursed
semi-annually. Submission periods for requisitioning grant funds on a semi-annual disbursement basis will be 14
days commencing from the 6-month anniversary date of grant approval. Grant funds under the special disbursement
method will be requisitioned in accordance with the applicable provision in paragraph (e)(4) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the reimbursement method, grant funds requisitioned for individual projects in increments of $100,000 or
greater, or at least 25 percent of the amount approved for the revolving loan fund, whichever is less, may be submitted
for disbursement at any time. Under the special disbursement method, grant funds of less than $100,000 may be requisitioned
for disbursement at any time. However, the minimum requisition will be $50,000, or the total grant award, whichever
is less.

Special economic status. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator has the discretion to designate special economic status (up to 25 points) to applications submitted
by borrowers that have documented one or more of the following four conditions in one or more county(ies) to be served
by the proposed project: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A designation of disaster area by the President of the United States which has been so designated within three years
prior to applying to REA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The loss, removal, or closing of a major source or sources of employment in the last 3 years which causes an increase
of 2 percentage points or more in the area's most recent unemployment rate compared with the period immediately before
the dislocation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Chronic or long-term economic deterioration, documented by one or both of the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An unemployment level equal to or greater than 1.5 times the National average unemployment percentage from 4 out
of the last 5 years, starting with the most current statistics available. The applicant, when calculating recent
years' unemployment percentages, should compare county statistics with the National Average unemployment for
the corresponding year. Statistics on unemployment will be based on figures provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, the Administrator may, at his discretion, also consider verifiable, published State statistical data
provided by the applicant in situations where county-wide statistical data is not representative of local conditions.
Such statistical data must be part of a recognized database which reflects information for other areas within the
State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A 15% loss of population due to out-migration over the most recent 10-year decennial census, based on the U.S. Bureau
of the Census decennial data; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A designation as a Rural Empowerment Zone or Rural Enterprise Community by the Empowerment Zone Program authorized
by Section 13301 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66 (107 Stat. 312), 26 U.S.C. 1391&hyph;1393.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model
DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and &hyph;30F series airplanes, that currently requires inspections
to detect ice or snow accumulation on top of the fuselage and in the inlet of the number 2 engine, and removal of ice and
snow accumulation. This amendment adds certain airplanes to the applicability of the rule and limits the inspection
requirement to only a certain group of airplanes. This amendment is prompted by the development of improved fan blades
on certain engines and the identification of additional airplanes that are subject to the unsafe condition. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to minimize damage to the number 2 engine due to ingestion of ice and snow.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39&hyph;2094, which is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
-30F series airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1994 (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36375). The action proposed to supersede AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, which currently requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections to detect ice and snow accumulation on top of the fuselage and in the inlet of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number 2 engine, and removal of ice and snow. The action proposed to add Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DC&hyph;10&hyph;15 series airplanes to the applicability of the rule, and to limit the inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to only a certain group of airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 379 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&hyph;30F, and &hyph;15 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 226 airplanes of U.S. registry will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be affected by this AD. (Currently, there are no Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;15 series airplanes of U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry that will be affected by this AD.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections that were previously required by AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, and retained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the inspection requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $12,430, or $55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per airplane, per inspection. This AD will only add the cost of inspections for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and &hyph;30F series airplanes having all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid fan blades in the number 2 engine position, the economic burden will be reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the previous requirement to inspect these airplanes in accordance with the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD will be eliminated by this AD. However, this does not relieve operators of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to comply with the requirements of &sect;&sect;91.527 (``Operating in icing conditions'') and
121.629 (``Operation in icing conditions''_air carriers) of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.527 and 121.629). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni
Agusta S.p.A. Model A109A and A109AII series helicopters, that currently imposes a calendar life limit of 10 years
and 6 months on the main rotor retention strap assemblies (strap assemblies). This amendment requires reducing the
calendar life limit to 8 years. This amendment is prompted by additional service experience and analyses, that show
the current life limit needs to be reduced from 10 years and 6 months to 8 years to prevent deterioration and subsequent
failure of the strap assemblies. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the strap assemblies,
loss of a main rotor blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 37914). That action proposed to require an 8-year calendar life instead of a 10 years and 6 months
life limit on the strap assemblies, part numbers 2601521 and 109&hyph;0101&hyph;95&hyph;1, &hyph;3, and &hyph;105.

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, the words ``since installation''
have been removed and the word ``total'' has been added to paragraph (a)(2) to further clarify that the TIS and the calendar
years relate to the total time on the strap assemblies and not to the time since they were installed on the helicopter.
Also, the terms ``calendar year'' and ``calendar month'' have now been defined in paragraph (a)(3). Finally, the
average labor rate was raised from $55 to $60. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require
the adoption of the rule as proposed with the noted changes. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither
increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 46 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
4 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $1,931 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $99,866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

These final rules institute a new international services survey, the BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial
Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial Services Providers and Unaffiliated Foreign Persons, to be conducted
by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce. The survey will, for the first time, collect
comprehensive information on trade in financial services between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated
foreign persons. It is intended to cover the universe of such transactions by type and by country. The information
is needed to support trade policy initiatives, including trade negotiations, on financial services and to compile
the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts. The survey will be conducted once every 5 years
under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act
of 1988. The first survey will cover 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the July 28, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
volume 59, No. 144, 59 FR 38387, BEA published a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth reporting requirements
for a new survey, the BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial Services
Providers and Unaffiliated Foreign Persons. No comments on the proposed rules were received. As a result, the final
rules are the same as the proposed rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final rules amend existing 15 CFR 801.9 and add new 15 CFR 801.11 to implement the new survey. The survey will be
conducted by BEA under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (P.L. 94&hyph;472, 90 Stat.
2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101&hyph;3108, as amended) and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100&hyph;418,
15 U.S.C. 4908(b)). Section 4(a) of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act provides that ``The
President shall, to the extent he deems necessary and feasible_*&blank;*&blank;*(4) conduct *&blank;*&blank;*
benchmark surveys with respect to trade in services between unaffiliated United States persons and foreign persons
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;'' In Section 3 of Executive Order 11961, as amended by Executive Order 12518, the President
delegated the authority under the Act as concerns international trade in services to the Secretary of Commerce, who
has redelegated it to BEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directs that ``The Secretary (of Commerce) shall ensure that *&blank;*&blank;*
there is included in the Data Bank information on service sector activity that is as complete and timely as information
on economic activity in the merchandise sector. The Secretary shall undertake a new benchmark survey of services
transactions, including transactions with respect to *&blank;*&blank;* banking services; (and) brokerage services.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major purposes of the survey are to provide the information on financial services needed in monitoring U.S. services
trade, analyzing its effects on the U.S. economy, formulating U.S. international trade policy, supporting bilateral
and multilateral trade negotiations, compiling the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts,
developing U.S. international price indexes for services, assessing U.S. competitiveness in international trade
in services, and improving the ability of U.S. businesses to identify and evaluate market opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BE&hyph;80 survey will be conducted once every 5 years, and the first survey will be for 1994. The survey covers
the universe of financial services transactions between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign
persons. Reporting is required from U.S. financial services providers who have sales to or purchases from unaffiliated
foreign persons in all covered financial services combined in excess of $1 million during the reporting year. Those
financial services providers meeting this criteria must supply data on the amount of their sales or purchases of each
covered type of service, disaggregated by country. U.S. financial services providers that have covered transactions
of less than $1 million during the reporting year are asked to provide, on a voluntary basis, estimates only of their
total sales or purchases of each type of financial service. The survey is scheduled to be mailed to potential respondents
in February 1995, and completed reports are due May 31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the information from the benchmark survey will be updated in nonbenchmark years by an annual
follow-on survey that is more limited in scope and that will cover only a sample of the companies reporting in the BE&hyph;80
survey.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 4 to 150 hours, with an overall
average burden of 7.5 hours. This includes time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments

to: Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BE&hyph;1), U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20503; and to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration,
under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that these final rules will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The exemption level for the survey excludes most small
businesses from mandatory reporting. Reporting is required only if total sales or total purchases transactions
in financial services with unaffiliated foreign persons by U.S. persons who are financial services providers, or
by U.S. persons whose consolidated enterprise includes a separately organized subsidiary or part that is a financial
services provider, exceed $1 million during the year. In addition, international business tends to be conducted
mainly by the larger companies in a given industry; in the financial services industry, this is particularly true,
because of the high degree of consolidation occurring in that industry in the United States during the past several
years. In any event, small businesses tend to have specialized operations and activities, so those with reportable
transactions will likely not have significant amounts of data to report; therefore, the burden on them will be relatively
small.

Rules and regulations for the BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial
Services Providers and Unaffiliated Foreign Persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial Services Providers and
Unaffiliated Foreign Persons, will be conducted covering companies' 1994 fiscal year and every fifth year thereafter.
All legal authorities, provisions, definitions, and requirements contained in &sect;801.1 through &sect;801.9
are applicable to this survey. Additional rules and regulations for the BE&hyph;80 survey are given in paragraphs
(a) through (d) of this section. More detailed instructions are given on the report form itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Who must report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mandatory reporting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reports are required from each U.S. person who is a financial services provider or intermediary, or whose consolidated
U.S. enterprise includes a separately organized subsidiary or part that is a financial services provider or intermediary,
and who had transactions (either sales or purchases) directly with unaffiliated foreign persons in all financial
services combined in excess of $1,000,000 during its fiscal year covered by the survey. The $1,000,000 threshold
should be applied to financial services transactions with unaffiliated foreign persons by all parts of the consolidated
U.S. enterprise combined that are financial services providers or intermediaries. Because the $1,000,000 threshold
applies separately to sales and purchases, the mandatory reporting requirement may apply only to sales, only to purchases,
or to both sales and purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The determination of whether a U.S. financial services provider or intermediary is subject to this mandatory
reporting requirement may be judgmental, that is, based on the judgment of knowledgeable persons in a company who
can identify reportable transactions on a recall basis, with a reasonable degree of certainty, without conducting
a detailed manual records search.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reporters who file pursuant to this mandatory reporting requirement must provide data on total sales and/or
purchases of each of the covered types of financial services transactions and must disaggregate the totals by country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Voluntary reporting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If, during the fiscal year covered, sales or purchases of financial services by a firm that is a financial services
provider or intermediary, or by a firm's subsidiaries or parts combined that are financial services providers or
intermediaries, are $1,000,000 or less, the U.S. person is requested to provide an estimate of the total for each type
of service. Provision of this information is voluntary. Because the $1,000,000 threshold applies separately to
sales and purchases, this voluntary reporting option may apply only to sales, only to purchases, or to both sales and
purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BE&hyph;80 definition of financial services provider.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of financial services provider used for this survey is analogous in coverage to the finance and insurance
part of Division H of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC major groups 60 through 64, and major
group 67). More specifically, companies and/or subsidiaries and other separable parts of companies in the following
industries are defined as financial services providers: Depository institutions (including commercial banks
and thrifts); nondepository credit institutions; security and commodity futures brokers, dealers, exchanges,
traders, underwriters, and services providers (including investment bankers and providers of securities custody
services); credit card companies, insurance carriers, agents, brokers and services providers; investment advisors
and managers; mutual funds; pension funds; trusts; holding companies; investors; oil royalty traders; etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Covered types of services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The BE&hyph;80 survey covers the following types of financial services transactions (purchases and/or sales) between
U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign persons: Brokerage, except foreign exchange brokerage
services; private placement services; underwriting services; financial management services; credit-related
services, except credit card services; credit card services; financial advisory and custody services; securities
lending services; foreign exchange brokerage services; and other financial services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What to file.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The BE&hyph;80 survey consists of Forms BE&hyph;80(A) and BE&hyph;80(B). Before completing a Form BE&hyph;80(B),
a consolidated U.S. enterprise (including the top parent and all of its subsidiaries and parts combined) must complete
Form BE&hyph;80(A) to determine its reporting status. If the enterprise is subject to the mandatory reporting requirement,
or if it is exempt from the mandatory reporting requirement but chooses to report data voluntarily, either a separate
Form BE&hyph;80(B) may be filed for each separately organized financial services subsidiary or part of the consolidated
U.S. enterprise, or a single BE&hyph;80(B) may be filed, representing the sum of covered transactions by all financial
services subsidiaries or parts of the enterprise combined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reporters that receive the BE&hyph;80 survey from BEA, but that are not reporting data in either the mandatory
or voluntary section of any Form BE&hyph;80(B), must return the Exemption Claim, attached to Form BE&hyph;80(A),
to BEA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is modifying 17 CFR 200.41&hyph;200.42 concerning seriatim consideration of business and actions
by individual Commissioners on a delegated basis in order to formalize current practice and clarify that any member
of the Commission may schedule a matter for joint deliberation, regardless of the number of Commissioners who have
voted to approve it, and that a member of the Commission who is serving as duty officer is authorized to approve a formal
order of private investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined that these amendments and additions to its procedural rules relate solely to the agency's
organization, procedure or practice. Therefore, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'')
regarding notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunities for public participation, and prior publication
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 are not applicable. Similarly, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 which apply only when notice and comment are required by the APA or other laws, are not applicable.

Section 23(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'')
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the anti-competitive effects of such
rules, if any, and to balance any impact against the regulatory benefits gained in furthering the purposes of the Exchange
Act. The Commission has considered the changes adopted in this release in light of the standards cited in section 23(a)(2)
and believes that their adoption would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the Exchange Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document the Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on furloughs. Section 570.33(c) contained provisions
governing the choice of transportation for transfers to community corrections centers. As revised, these provisions
have been simplified to indicate that an inmate may choose the means of transportation if all transportation costs
are to be borne by the inmate. The intended effect of the amendment is to reduce costs to the Bureau.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on furloughs. A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 July 1, 1981 (46 FR 34552) and was amended September 30, 1983 (48 FR 45051) and January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3510).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3512) for the purpose of amending the provisions in &sect;570.33(c) which state that the Warden
may allow an inmate scheduled for transfer to a community corrections center (CCC) to choose the means of transportation
to the CCC. Under these provisions, the inmate paid all costs when the distance travelled was not over 150 miles, but
the inmate merely paid the difference in cost when the distance was over 150 miles and the inmate preferred to travel
by plane rather than by public ground transportation. As proposed for revision, paragraph (c) was simplified to indicate
that an inmate may choose the means of transportation if all transportation costs are to be borne by the inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period closed on March 22, 1994. The Bureau received no comment on this rulemaking, and the Bureau is therefore
adopting the proposed amendment as a final rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the Pacific ocean perch TAC for the Eastern Regulatory Area was established
by the final 1994 specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 1,265 metric tons (mt).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), established in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii)
a directed fishing allowance for Pacific ocean perch of 1,165 mt, with consideration that 100 mt would be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in this area. The Regional Director has determined that this directed
fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch
in the Eastern Regulatory Area effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 24, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December
31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;672.20(g).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations to require manufacturers of licensed biological
products (hereinafter referred to as licensed manufacturers) to report to FDA within 15 working days all adverse
experiences associated with the use of a biological product that are both serious and unexpected; any significant
increase in the frequency of a serious, but expected adverse experience; periodically, all other adverse experiences;
and product distribution and disposition data. FDA is taking this action to provide a mechanism under which licensed
manufacturers would inform the agency, on a timely basis, of any unanticipated safety problems with marketed biological
products.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 24, 1979 (44 FR 24233), FDA made available for public comment a draft proposed regulation that would require
the maintenance of records and submission of reports of adverse experiences involving licensed biological products.
After evaluating the comments received and analyzing other information, FDA issued a proposed regulation (hereinafter
referred to as the 1990 proposal) and notice of availability of a draft guideline in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 29, 1990 (55 FR 11611 and 11655, respectively). The 1990 proposal was to require all manufacturers of licensed
biological products to submit the following reports to FDA: (1) Alert reports within 15 working days of receipt of
adverse experiences associated with the use of a licensed biological product that are both ``serious and unexpected,''
and of any ``significant increase in frequency'' of an adverse experience that is both ``serious and unexpected;''
and (2) periodic reports of all adverse experiences, including both serious and nonserious adverse experiences,
that are not included in a 15-day Alert report. The statutory authority for promulgating these regulations was described
in detail in the preamble to the 1990 proposal (55 FR 11611 at 11613). The agency provided 60 days for interested persons
to submit written comments on the 1990 proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to promulgation of this final rule, only adverse experiences associated with certain childhood vaccines (see
53 FR 10565, April 1, 1988) and fatalities resulting from blood collection or transfusion (&sect;606.170 (21 CFR
606.170)) were required to be reported to FDA for biological products. Although many manufacturers of other types
of biological products voluntarily submit adverse experience reports to FDA, there has not necessarily been consistent
or complete reporting from all licensed manufacturers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31596), FDA issued a notice announcing the availability of a new form for reporting adverse events
and product problems with human drug products, biologic products, medical devices, special nutritional products,
and other products regulated by FDA. One version of the form (FDA Form 3500) was made available for use by health professionals
for voluntary reporting; the other version of the form (FDA Form 3500A) was made available for use by user facilities,
distributors, and manufacturers for reporting that is required by statute or by FDA regulation. The new form is part
of an FDA MEDWATCH program which is intended to consolidate and simplify reporting of adverse events and product problems
for all FDA-regulated products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the comments received in response to the 1990 proposal, while having merit, if implemented would require changes
to the regulations governing the reporting of adverse experiences for biologic products which would cause these
requirements to diverge significantly from the requirements and reporting program for drugs as provided in &sect;&sect;310.305
and 314.80 (21 CFR 310.305 and 314.80)). Such a divergence would be contrary to the MEDWATCH program which is intended,
in part, to enhance consistency in the reporting and collection of information on adverse experiences related to
FDA-regulated products. Rather than making such significant changes in this final rule, FDA is issuing a notice of
proposed rulemaking elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which would appropriately amend the requirements in &sect;&sect;310.305, 312.32 (21 CFR 312.32), and 314.80 for
reporting of adverse experiences related to human drugs and the requirements in this final rule (&sect;&sect;600.80
and 600.81) for reporting adverse experiences related to biological products. Later in this preamble, in response
to a number of public comments which request significant changes to the regulations, FDA refers to the proposed rule
which provides a more substantial discussion of the issues involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is also announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``The Guideline for Adverse Experience Reporting
for Licensed Biological Products'' (referred to as ``guideline'' in this final rule). The guideline discusses in
detail the reports required by this rule, and provides guidance concerning some appropriate means of meeting the
reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Highlights of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes procedures under &sect;&sect;600.80 and 600.81 for licensed manufacturers to inform
FDA about adverse experiences that are associated with the use of a licensed biological product and about biological
product distribution. These procedures are intended to support the agency's efforts to protect the public safety
by providing the agency with the information necessary for effective postmarket surveillance of biological products.
This final rule requires licensed manufacturers of biological products to submit various reports to the agency and
specifies the timeframes for submission of these reports. The reports are: (1) Fifteen-day Alert reports, (2) increased
frequency alert reports, (3) periodic adverse experience reports and (4) distribution reports. The timeframes
and contents of these adverse experience reports were the subject of numerous comments, which are discussed below.
In addition to the reporting requirements, the final rule specifies record-keeping requirements, provides for
exemptions of two categories of biological products, provides a disclaimer regarding causality, and provides for
license revocation if licensed manufacturers fail to establish and maintain records and submit the required reports.
In addition, this final rule provides procedures, under &sect;600.90, for applying for waivers from any of the reporting
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements in this final rule are consistent with existing requirements in &sect;&sect;314.80 and 314.81
(21 CFR 314.81) regarding approved new drug products, except when differences are necessary to accommodate laws,
terminology, procedures, and characteristics unique for biological products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new procedures apply to all licensed manufacturers of biological products and any person, other than the licensed
manufacturer of a biological product, whose name appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer,
packer, distributor, shared manufacturer, joint manufacturer, or a participant in divided manufacturing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Format
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The format of &sect;600.80 has been revised from what was proposed to be consistent with &sect;314.80. FDA believes
that the revised format will reduce the burden for manufacturers following the regulations for both drug and biological
products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Comments on the Proposed Rule and FDA Responses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received 15 letters of comment on the proposed rule. Most letters contained numerous comments on various areas
of the proposed rule. Four of these comments supported codification of the reporting requirements for adverse experiences
associated with biological products. Other comments either addressed particular paragraphs in the proposed regulation
or dealt with the effect of the regulation on a particular type of biological product. In addition to the amendments
discussed below, editorial changes were made throughout the rule. A summary of these comments and the agency's responses
follow:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Consistency With Section 314.80 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on &sect;600.80 recognized the reporting issues unique to biological products and were supportive
of both the 1990 proposal and the draft guideline for recognizing the differences between drugs and biological products.
In contrast, four comments requested that FDA not deviate from the rules and guidelines applicable to drugs and requested
that the regulations for reporting adverse experiences for biological products mirror the regulations for drugs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends these rules to be consistent with other agency initiatives and requirements regarding adverse experience
reporting for drugs and medical devices wherever practical. This is demonstrated by the new adverse experience reporting
Form FDA&hyph;3500A, which, with the exception of adverse experience reports associated with vaccines, is to be
used for reporting of adverse events associated with drugs, biologics, and certain other products regulated by FDA.
The final rule contains requirements unique to biological products only when necessary to accommodate the laws applicable
only to biological products, such as vaccines, or to accommodate special characteristics of biological products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Agency Review of Adverse Experience Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested that the unit of FDA responsible for receiving adverse experience reports for drugs continue
to be responsible for the adverse experiences for biologics to assure consistency of interpretation of the regulations
and dissemination of information within FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency intends to maintain consistency between the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the
Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research (CDER) in the interpretation of the regulations, especially with respect
to terminology. A separate unit was created with the responsibilities related to postmarketing surveillance of
licensed biological products because the agency recognizes that these products can present different safety concerns
due to inherent differences in the products. In addition, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA)
mandated specific reporting requirements for manufacturers of certain vaccines and for health care providers administering
those vaccines. VAERS was established to receive these required reports, as well as reports on other vaccines. The
VAERS program is administered jointly by FDA and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and replaces
previous vaccine reporting systems within both agencies. Section 600.80(c) has been amended in the final rule to
reflect the change of address for submitting reports due to the reorganization and relocation of CBER.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Clarification of Overlap Between the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and &sect;600.80 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received requesting clarification of overlap between the requirements of NCVIA and the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NCVIA created a new Title XXI of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act). Section 2125 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 300aa-25)
requires health care providers who administer certain vaccines and manufacturers of the vaccines to report specified
adverse experiences, occurring within specified time intervals after administration of the vaccines. These adverse
experience reports are submitted to VAERS, which is jointly managed by FDA and CDC and became operational on November
1, 1990. A form VAERS&hyph;1 was developed for these reports. When the requirements set forth in both &sect;600.80
and NCVIA necessitate reporting of an adverse event, licensed manufacturers of vaccines are not required to submit
duplicate reports to VAERS and FDA. Submission of the report to VAERS is sufficient. However, licensed manufacturers
of vaccines must comply with the regulations in &sect;600.80. Therefore, any requirements in these regulations
that are in addition to those specified in the NCVIA must be satisfied. For example, although NCVIA does not specify
the time periods for submission of adverse experience reports, the time periods set forth in &sect;600.80 apply to
reports being submitted to VAERS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Requests for Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six comments requested waivers from the reporting requirements for specific types of adverse experiences or for
certain categories of biological products. These requests for waivers were with respect to parts or all of the requirements
of proposed &sect;600.80. In addition, one comment requested that the final rule specify the provisions for requesting
a waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the provisions for a waiver should be specified in the final rule and has added a new &sect;600.90
describing the procedures for requesting a waiver. Section 600.90 is similar to &sect;314.90 (21 CFR 314.90), the
provision for waivers for drugs or antibiotics. Manufacturers and other interested persons should submit requests
for waivers as provided in &sect;600.90 of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Economic Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested clarification of FDA's estimate of the cost of complying with the reporting requirements of
the proposed rule of approximately $255,490. The company estimates that its cost in labor and overhead would be approximately
$40,000. In contrast, another comment stated that the company did not anticipate that this reporting requirement
would significantly alter the manner in which companies would share their postmarketing information with FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's assessment of cost was made over 4 years ago when both the number of approved biological products was fewer
and costs somewhat less. In addition, the agency's figures did not take into account overhead and other costs associated
with basic manufacturing practices. Every responsible manufacturer and distributor, regardless of the type of
product manufactured, implements a means to receive inquiries about the quality and adverse effects of its products
as good manufacturing practices and as an accepted part of doing business. Therefore, this cost has not been included
in assessing the cost of this regulation. The costs assessed for this regulation only related to the specific costs
incurred by the requirements in the regulation which are in addition to customary business practice. The costs of
the regulation are for preparation of the specific reports and analyses required by the regulation and do not include
the normal operating and overhead costs of doing business. The revised economic assessment is discussed at the end
of this preamble.

B. Definitions Section 600.80(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Adverse Experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments requested clarification of the definition of ``adverse experience'' in proposed &sect;600.80(a),
particularly the phrase ``significant failure of expected pharmacological action * * * whether or not considered
product related.'' One comment stated that the word ``significant'' has one meaning in the definition of ``adverse
experience'' and another statistical meaning in the usage of the term ``increased frequency'' in proposed &sect;600.80(c)(1)(ii)
and requested that the word be used consistently with the same meaning throughout the regulation. Another comment
requested a definition of ``significant failure'' as used in the definition of adverse experience. One comment requested
that the definition be amended to require reporting of changes in failure rates instead of any significant failure.
One comment gave the following examples of incidents that would be considered an adverse experience with any significant
failure: a patient who dies of acute myocardial infarction in spite of thrombolytic therapy; or a patient who dies
of congestive heart failure despite diuretic therapy, i.e., deaths from progression of the indicated disease. One
comment stated that it concurs with the agency's definition of ``adverse experience'' because it does not include
``loss of response'' as an adverse experience. The comment goes on to state that loss of immunity over time from a vaccine
is not logically an adverse event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the word ``significant'' when used in this context is a source of confusion and ambiguity. To
eliminate this source of confusion and to encourage the reporting of all adverse experiences, FDA revised &sect;314.80
to delete the word ``significant'' from the definition of ``adverse experience'' in the reporting requirements
for drugs (see 57 FR 17950, April 28, 1992) and is revising the definition of ``adverse experience'' in this final rule
by deleting the word ``significant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is retaining the proposed language in the definition of ``adverse experience'' instead of adopting the
suggestion to require reporting only of changes in failure rate because a ``change in failure rate'' can only be determined
retrospectively. A change in failure rate is to be reported in an increased frequency report; however, a failure of
expected pharmacological action that causes a serious and unexpected adverse experience in humans should be reported
within 15 days regardless of the rate of such reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the examples given may or may not indicate a ``failure of expected pharmacological action.''
For example, patients with congestive heart failure often have irreparable kidney damage which even the most potent
diuretics cannot overcome. In such a situation congestive heart failure would not be a failure of expected pharmacologic
action. However, the extent of pre-existing kidney damage and the degree to which kidney failure may be expected would
be demonstrable through kidney function tests prior to medication. Therefore, FDA is not amending the definition
of adverse experience as requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees partially with the comment regarding ``loss of response.'' If loss of immunity over time is the expected
pharmacologic action of the vaccine, then it is not an adverse experience. If loss of immunity is due to a patient's
compromised immune system, this also would not be considered an adverse experience. However, loss of immunity due
to an unexpected failure of the pharmacologic action of the vaccine, thereby leaving recipients susceptible to a
communicable disease, is an adverse experience and should be reported. The guideline points out that for purposes
of adverse events reporting, ``lack of effect'' is generally synonymous with ``failure to produce the expected pharmacologic
action.'' Certain products are indicated for immunization through a recommended course of several doses to achieve
a specified level of antibody titer to provide seroprotection. In this case, ``lack of effect'' is synonymous with
``failure to produce the expected pharmacologic action'' only when adequate seroconversion is not achieved following
the final dose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Blood Components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment noted that the language in the proposed &sect;600.80(l)(1) and preamble refers to blood components yet
the section of the CFR upon which the exemption is predicated (&sect;606.170) refers to blood products. The comment
specifically asked whether albumin and immunoglobulin are exempt from the rule and requested clarification of the
meaning of blood component in &sect;600.80(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is clarifying the regulations by adding in &sect;600.80(a) of the final rule a reference to 21 CFR 606.3(c), which
defines a ``Blood Component'' as ``that part of a single-donor unit of blood separated by physical or mechanical means.''
The exemption in &sect;600.80(l), for reporting adverse experiences associated with blood components, does not
include products derived from pooled blood such as albumin or immunoglobulin. Therefore, albumin and immunoglobulin
are biological products subject to this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA intends to propose revisions to &sect;606.170, concerning reports related to blood collection or transfusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments requested that a definition for ``disability'' be included in &sect;600.80(a) as the phrase ``permanently
disabling'' is used in the definition of ``serious.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the term ``disability'' should be defined and is proposing a definition in the notice of proposed
rulemaking found elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Increased Frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments on proposed &sect;600.80(a) requested clarification of the definition for ``increased frequency.''
Two comments stated that the proposed definition of ``increased frequency,'' as an increase in the rate of occurrence,
is misleading inasmuch as the rate of occurrence cannot be determined by a spontaneous reporting system. Two comments
requested that the definition of increased frequency take into account an adjustment for product exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with these comments and is revising the definition in &sect;600.80(a) as follows: ``Increased
frequency means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse biological product experience, after
appropriate adjustment for exposure to the biological product.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Life Threatening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested that a definition for ``life threatening'' be included, similar to that found in 21 CFR 312.32.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees and is proposing a definition of ``life threatening'' in the notice of proposed rulemaking found
elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments noted discrepancies between the preamble, &sect;600.80(a) of the proposed rule, reporting form
FDA&hyph;1639, and the draft guideline regarding the meaning of the term ``serious.'' The discrepancies consisted
of differences in scope regarding the reportability of overdose, prolonged hospitalization, and severe disability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify the discrepancies concerning ``overdose,'' the agency reevaluated the definition of ``serious'' to
determine whether all overdoses should be included in the definition and determined that not all overdoses are serious.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In resolving the discrepancies in the definition of ``serious'' regarding inpatient hospitalization, the agency
determined that prolonged inpatient hospitalization should be included as a serious adverse event. FDA is proposing
a revision of the definition of ``serious'' to exclude the term ``overdose'' and to include ``requires or prolongs
inpatient hospitalization'' in the notice of proposed rulemaking found elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``disability'' is discussed in section III.B.3 of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested that a definition for the word ``significant'' which compensates for changes in use patterns
be included in &sect;600.80(a). The comment is in reference to the use of the term ``significant'' in the increased
frequency alert reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees in part with this comment. The agency considers ``significant'' in this context to mean a noticeable
or measurable increase in frequency after adjustment for documented changes in use patterns. However, the agency
is not codifying this definition in &sect;600.80(a) because ``significant'' may have a different meaning in a different
context within adverse experience reporting. The guideline provides clarifying examples utilizing a formula and
table to determine if there is a significant increase in frequency of an adverse experience.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Clarification Between Product Defects and Adverse Experiences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested clarification regarding the definitions in &sect;600.80(a) for adverse experiences and
the reporting of product defects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``adverse experience'' in &sect;600.80(a) specifies that the adverse experience must be ``associated
with the use of a biological product in humans * * *.'' Therefore, product defects either discovered in the manufacturing
process or not associated with an adverse experience in humans are not subject to this regulation. These defects may
be reportable under good manufacturing practice regulations covered in 21 CFR 600.14. However, product defects
which result in an adverse experience in a human are subject to reporting under &sect;600.80.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Review of Adverse Experiences Section 600.8(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Reported by Scientific Papers or Competitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(b) stated that to place responsibility on the licensed manufacturer for review
of all adverse experience information pertaining to its product from any source, including published and unpublished
scientific papers, is both time consuming and possibly open to abuse by competitors. The comment went on to state that
if an unsubstantiated mailing from a competitor alleged ``adverse or unexpected experiences,'' the licensed manufacturer
becomes subject to the entire 15-day alert procedures, including the need to conduct, if not actually report to FDA,
the followup investigation. One comment asked the agency to specify the degree of vigor that licensed manufacturers
should use to pursue reports of adverse experiences in the scientific literature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 600.80(b) is not intended to require licensed manufacturers to discover every published and unpublished
report on its product. However, once a report of an adverse experience is made known to the licensed manufacturer,
it is the licensed manufacturer's responsibility to comply with the requirements in &sect;600.80 regardless of
the source of the adverse experience report. It is acceptable for the licensed manufacturer to come to the conclusion
that the mailing or publication alleging an adverse experience is false or misleading and report this conclusion
to the agency. In some cases the agency may take appropriate regulatory action against persons preparing a false or
misleading report of an adverse experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Lack of Response Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(b) stated that ``lack of response'' complaints from consumers do not have sufficient
validity to aid in decisionmaking and therefore should not be submitted to FDA. Another comment requested that ``lack
of response'' should not be submitted for single patient incidents but limited to studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that all reports of ``lack of response'' for single patient incidents should be reviewed and submitted
by the licensed manufacturer. Complaints from consumers should be verified with the patient's health-care provider,
if possible, prior to being submitted to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Clarification of Reporting Requirements Section 600.80(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c) requested clarification of terminology between the term ``applicant''
used in &sect;314.80 and the term ``manufacturer'' used in proposed &sect;600.80. One comment preferred the term
``licensee'' for this regulation regarding biological products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency uses the term ``licensed manufacturer'' in these rules because it presents a more accurate representation
of those required to comply with these regulations. These rules are being promulgated for the purpose of gathering
postmarketing surveillance information, which will occur after product licensing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments requested clarification of responsibilities for joint manufacturers, shared manufacturers, divided
manufacturers, and contractual manufacturers so that duplicate adverse experience reports are not submitted.
One comment requested that, in order to avoid duplicate reporting or failures to report adverse experiences, the
agency should add language similar to &sect;314.80(c)(1)(iii). Another comment requested that the agency specify
the reporting requirements of a nonapplicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that manufacturing of a biological product can be shared or divided among a number of business establishments.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55544), FDA published a notice that discussed cooperative manufacturing arrangements
for licensed biological products. In addition, 21 CFR 600.12(e) requires that ``each participating manufacturer
shall furnish to the manufacturer who prepares the product in final form for sale, barter or exchange, a copy of all
records relating to the manufacturing operations performed by such participating manufacturer insofar as they
concern the safety, purity and potency of the lots of the product involved, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
* * *.'' Other requirements regarding divided manufacturing are contained in 21 CFR 610.63, which requires that ``If
two or more establishments participate in the manufacture of a product, the name, address, and license number of each
must appear on the package label, and on the label of the container if capable of bearing a full label.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is clarifying the reporting requirements in &sect;600.80(c)(1)(iii) by substituting the term ``licensed
manufacturer'' for the term ``manufacturer.'' The agency intends that the manufacturer licensed to prepare the
final product for commercial distribution has the primary responsibility for reporting adverse experiences to
FDA. To prevent duplicate reports, language has been added to &sect;600.80(c)(1)(iii) in this final rule to clearly
delineate the responsibilities of the licensed manufacturer of the final product and other persons whose names may
appear on the product label.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Failure of Pharmacologic Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(c) requested that FDA not require single patient adverse experience forms
for each failure of expected pharmacological action. The comment suggested that increased frequency analyses should
not be performed on spontaneous lack of response reports because it is not possible for an appropriate baseline to
be constructed using either domestic or foreign spontaneous reports in this setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the use of single patient adverse experience reporting forms provides the agency with information
that may be helpful in assessing whether there is a need for further investigation of the reported lack of response.
The agency also believes that increased frequency analyses and reports are useful to serve as an indicator that an
investigation is needed to explore the issue further. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Followup Reports to 15-day Alerts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments regarding proposed &sect;600.80(c)(1)(i) questioned the need for a report that briefly describes
the steps taken to seek additional information about an adverse event and the reasons why such information could not
be obtained. The comments stated that the proposed language placed an additional burden on licensed manufacturers
by requesting not only that they make every effort to obtain such information but also that they write a report describing
such efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;600.80(c) licensed manufacturers will be required to seek additional information and document the
steps taken to comply with the rule in a manner consistent with &sect;314.80(c). The agency is not, at this time, specifying
the format for this documentation. The agency must be able to verify the licensed manufacturer's efforts and advise
licensed manufacturers of additional steps that should be pursued to retrieve the necessary information when appropriate.
The proposed rule stated that this report should not be submitted to the agency unless so requested but should be maintained
in the licensed manufacturer's files. This requirement differs from &sect;314.80(c)(1)(i). The agency believes
it would reduce the burden for manufacturers who produce both biologics and drugs if &sect;600.80(c)(1)(i) is consistent
with &sect;314.80(c)(1)(i). Therefore, the sentence in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;600.80(c)(1)(i), ``This report should be retained by the manufacturer in its files but not submitted as a followup
to FDA unless so requested'' has been deleted. Further discussion of changing the final disposition of these reports
is included in the notice of proposed rulemaking found elsewhere in this issue of the

3. Increased Frequency Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(1)(ii) requested information regarding the utility of increased frequency
analysis. These comments suggest that the analysis is not of the increased frequency of adverse experiences but rather
the analysis is of the increased frequency of reports of adverse experiences. One comment requested that the agency
develop improved methods for determining increased frequency that would account for fluctuations in reporting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that increased frequency of adverse experience reports does not necessarily correlate with an increase
in adverse experiences. Case reports are used to alert the agency about areas which may need further investigation.
FDA takes into account the fact that reporting rates vary over time in postmarketing surveillance when analyzing
the reporting rate for an individual biologic. FDA does not assume that an increase in incidence of adverse experiences
will automatically trigger an increase in reports of adverse experience. Nor does the agency assume that an increase
in the number of reports of adverse experiences necessarily indicates an increase in incidence of adverse experiences.
The agency believes that an increase in reporting rates, when taken into account with other relevant information,
may indicate that an epidemiologic investigation is needed to explore the situation further.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2) noted a discrepancy on when the reporting period begins. One comment
requested that the interval for periodic reporting be extended to annually rather than quarterly. One comment requested
that the agency extend the time for submitting periodic reports from 30 to 60 days after the end of the reporting period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the reports need to be submitted in a timely manner because the public is continuing to be exposed
to the products. Accordingly, FDA is retaining the proposed time schedule for submitting periodic reports in this
final rule. In the notice of proposed rulemaking published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is proposing to amend the regulations regarding when the reporting period begins and to amend the schedule for
submitting periodic reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Schedule for Submitting Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) requested that the agency limit reporting requirements (other
than 15-day alerts) to the first 3 or 10 years of marketing. These comments stated that the initial postmarketing period
would provide the most benefit and that after an initial period these reports would offer little benefit and would
be a burden to the agency and the licensed manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that there is a need for licensed manufacturers to continually monitor adverse experiences. The length
of time a product is marketed does not guarantee that it will not be implicated in latent adverse experiences that were
not recognized previously. Novel adverse experiences can occur when a biological product is used concomitantly
with another drug or biological product. In addition, a product that has been on the market for many years can be implicated
in adverse experiences that were either previously undetected or unknown in the scientific community. For these
reasons, this requirement for periodic review and submission of reports of adverse experiences is necessary for
the public safety. However, the licensed manufacturer can request a waiver under &sect;600.90 in order to decrease
or eliminate the periodic reporting requirements for older products with a proven safety record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) the agency may also require more frequent reports for products if appropriate; for
example, products with special safety or efficacy concerns. Similarly the agency may require less frequent reports
or no reports for products with a history of continual safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Effect of Significant Change in Manufacturing on Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) expressed concern that significant changes in the manufacturing
process, as provided in the Product License Application (PLA), may lead FDA to require that the frequency of the periodic
reports be maintained as quarterly reports. The example given in the comment was for influenza virus vaccine. The
comments questioned whether this product would be considered a new product annually due to its inherent strain changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Influenza vaccine is an example of a product for which more frequent reports may be appropriate. The agency considers
the influenza vaccine to be a new product annually because variations in influenza strains make it necessary to reformulate
the influenza vaccine each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, there have been many reports of adverse experiences associated with the influenza vaccine, including
reports of Guillain-Barre Syndrome and false positive test results for other viral markers. In situations such as
this, the agency may require more frequent reporting which will help it assess the magnitude and accuracy of reports
of adverse experiences. In &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) FDA may upon written notice extend or reestablish the requirement
that a licensed manufacturer submit quarterly reports, or require that the license manufacturer submit reports
under this section at different times than those stated. Prompt reporting of these adverse experiences will make
it easier to either recall a problem lot or discredit a false rumor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Requirement for Negative Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2) requested that the agency clarify the discrepancy between the proposed
rule and the draft guideline regarding periodic reports for products that had no adverse experiences reported. The
proposed rule did not require periodic reports for products that had no adverse experiences reported. The guideline
asked that a letter be sent stating that no adverse experiences were reported. These comments also stated that the
negative report is an ``undue burden.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline has been changed to be consistent with the final rule in not requiring negative reporting at this time.
However, the agency believes that the negative reports are appropriate for the agency to determine that the licensed
manufacturer is focusing attention on whether there have been adverse experiences reported to FDA. Therefore, requirements
regarding submission of negative reports are included in the notice of proposed rulemaking found elsewhere in this
issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

8. Tabular Line Listing in Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(ii)(C) regarding the tabular listing of adverse experiences required
in the periodic reports stated that the requirements to list the patient's identification number, age, sex, and adverse
experience terms in the tabular listing were viewed as unnecessary and excessive. Also noted were discrepancies
regarding the tabular listing requirements between the guideline and the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the age and sex are not necessary in the tabular listing. However, the agency believes that the
adverse experience terms should be included in such a listing. The tabular line listing is intended to provide a synopsis
of individual case histories previously submitted, to assist FDA in identifying potential issues and individual
case histories for further review. The agency is amending &sect;600.80(c)(2) to require only the licensed manufacturer's
patient identification number and adverse experience terms in the tabular listing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Submission of Labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(ii)(E) requested that the agency not require licensed manufacturers
to submit with periodic reports a copy of the most current labeling, including container labels, carton labels, package
inserts, and other materials distributed with the product. In addition, the comments stated that the current labeling
is reviewed by FDA before use and licensed manufacturers should not be required to repeatedly submit this information
with periodic reports. One comment stated that the only labeling useful for evaluating adverse experience reports
is the package insert, unless the product is sold over-the-counter, then submission of directions for consumers
on the container label may be justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with the comments and is amending &sect;600.80(c)(2)(ii)(C) of the final rule to require ``a history
of actions taken since the last report because of adverse experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated).''
This ensures that the review of the adverse experiences is conducted in the context of the latest information available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Submission of Distribution Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ten comments related to various aspects of the requirements in proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(iv) for submission
of distribution data for licensed biological products. Two comments stated that the request for foreign distribution
data is a heavy burden. Three comments stated that the requirement to report dose distribution data is difficult and
inappropriate for certain types of products and that this information is not required in &sect;314.80 for drugs.
Two comments disagreed with a statement in the preamble that the quantity of a product distributed enables FDA to estimate
more accurately the incidence of a product's adverse effects. The comments reasoned that distribution data do not
determine how much product is actually used. One comment questioned FDA's ability to keep the distribution information
confidential. One comment stated that the proposed schedule for distribution reports places a hardship on manufacturers
as it required quarterly reports for new biological products, annual reports for biological products licensed more
than 3 years, and annual reports for drugs. Another comment requested guidance on the preferred format for distribution
data. The agency agrees that foreign distribution data should not be required for biological products. Although
the agency agrees that distribution data do not accurately estimate the incidence of a product's adverse effects,
it is information needed to help FDA determine whether further study is needed. FDA, on its own initiative, is amending
the final rule to parallel the drug regulations format by moving the requirements to submit distribution data to &sect;600.81.
The agency has revised the schedule for submitting distribution reports in &sect;600.81 of the final rule. The reports
will now be due on the semiannual and annual anniversary of the licensing of the product. Licensed manufacturers that
believe that the requirements for submission of distribution data are inappropriate for certain types of products
may request a waiver under &sect;600.90, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble. Until a waiver is granted the provisions
specified in the final rule are applicable.

F. Review of Scientific Literature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on &sect;600.80(d) requested that submission of reports from scientific literature be limited to those
articles where the author believes the product is associated with the experience; i.e., ``reasonable causation''
by the author should be used in determining what adverse experiences from the literature need to be reported to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that reports of adverse experiences in the literature where the author clearly states that the
licensed manufacturer's product is not the cause do not need to be reported. Reports in the scientific literature
where no conclusion is reached regarding causality should be further investigated by the licensed manufacturer
and reported to FDA if the adverse experience is associated or remains possibly associated with the licensed biological
product. The licensed manufacturer should document the information that determines the cause to be other than product
related and retain this documentation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Reporting Form FDA&hyph;1639 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five comments on proposed &sect;600.80(f) concerned the use of Form FDA&hyph;1639 for reporting adverse experiences.
One comment stated that the form is inappropriate for their biological products, one comment asked that the form be
updated, one comment requested that Form FDA&hyph;1639 be retained for VAERS reporting as well as for adverse experience
reporting for drugs and biological products. Two comments questioned whether an approved alternate form for reporting
adverse experiences for drugs must be resubmitted to CBER for approval. One comment requested that the agency not
allow implementation of an alternative reporting form as it will cause a hardship in computerization of adverse experience
data across the biological and pharmaceutical product lines. This comment requested that the same form (Form FDA&hyph;1639)
be used for all adverse experience reports regardless of the nature of the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has designed a new adverse experience reporting form (Form FDA&hyph;3500A) which, with the exception of reporting
adverse experiences associated with vaccines, is ordinarily to be used to report under &sect;&sect;310.305, 312.32,
314.80, 600.80, and parts 803 and 807 regarding drugs, biological products, and devices, respectively. The new form
will simplify and consolidate the reporting of adverse events and product problems and will enhance agency-wide
consistency in the collection of postmarketing data. Any computer-generated forms will have to be submitted to MEDWATCH,
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;9787, for approval to use in complying with this final rule. As one comment
suggested, alternative formats will make computerization of adverse experience data across product lines difficult.
Therefore, a licensed manufacturer should submit adequate justification for an alternative format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form FDA&hyph;3500A is referenced in &sect;600.80(f) of the final rule. The term ``form designated by FDA'' is used
throughout the remainder of the final rule to accommodate any future changes in the form itself. For vaccines the designated
form for reporting adverse experiences is Form VAERS&hyph;1. The form for VAERS is discussed in a published report
in

H. Reporter Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(h) requested that if the reporter is the patient (or relative) that his or her
name not be listed on the adverse experience form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concurs with this request for adverse experience reporting for licensed biological products other than
vaccine-associated experiences being reported in accordance with NCVIA. Under NCVIA it would be appropriate to
include the patient's name in the report because copies of this report may be made available to the vaccinee or legal
representative of the vaccinee. For adverse experience reporting of licensed biological products other than vaccines
being reported under NCVIA, the report should not include the name of the patient, but should assign a unique code number
to each report. For adverse experience reporting of biological products, patient identifiers are not releasable
to the public under FDA's public information regulations (21 CFR part 20). Section 600.80(h) is amended to reflect
that VAERS reports are subject to the CDC Privacy Act System.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment concerning proposed &sect;600.80(h) requested that the agency increase the number of characters in
the unique code number assigned to each report from eight characters in length to nine characters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency encourages consistency by designating in the final rule a number of characters to be used, to simplify preparing
and processing the reports. To allow some flexibility, note that &sect;600.80(h) in the final rule recommends but
does not require use of a code number of eight characters or less.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(i) related to the length of time a licensed manufacturer is required to keep
adverse experience records. One comment requested clarification regarding whether form letters sent by the licensed
manufacturer to the adverse experience reporter must be retained 10 years; another comment requested that the recordkeeping
be limited to 1 year past the involved product's expiration date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that 10 years is a reasonable time to maintain such records. This requirement corresponds with existing
regulations for drug products. If a form letter to the reporter is the documentation that the licensed manufacturer
sought additional information about an adverse experience, then the form letter must be maintained in the file for
10 years. Any letters which are part of the correspondence regarding an adverse experience reporting must be maintained
in the file for 10 years.

K. Exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has determined that &sect;600.80(l) should be amended to clarify that licensed manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic
products, including assay systems for the detection of antibodies or antigens to retroviruses, report adverse experiences
under the device reporting regulations. The best way to monitor product defects with these licensed biological devices
is for them to be reported under the Medical Devices: Medical Device User Facility, Distributor, and Manufacturer
Reporting, Certification, and Registration Regulations (see 56 FR 60024, November 26, 1991). To eliminate any confusion
over how to report product defects with these products, the final rule is amended to state specifically that in vitro
diagnostics, including assays to detect antibodies or antigens to retroviruses (such as HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2),
are exempt from this rule but are subject to the device reporting regulations.

IV. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. The final rule codifies adverse experience reporting for biological products
currently being practiced by licensed manufacturers on a voluntary basis. FDA believes that the information collection
resulting from postmarket surveillance required by this final rule will be of benefit to the public health. FDA has
prepared a Threshold Assessment to estimate the cost to comply with the final rule by the regulated industry. The estimation
by FDA for the total annual cost to industry is $3,937,164. The agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further
analysis is required.

V. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Description
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: FDA is charged with the responsibility for determining that a biological product meets the statutory standards
for safety, purity, and potency for initial and continued licensure. To carry out this mandate, the agency needs to
be informed whenever a manufacturer of a licensed biological product receives or otherwise becomes aware of information
about adverse experiences associated with the use of its product. Only if FDA is provided with such information will
it be able to evaluate the risk, if any, associated with a biological product and take whatever action is necessary
to reduce or eliminate the public's exposure. FDA is taking this action to provide a mechanism under which manufacturers
would inform the agency, on a timely basis, of any unanticipated safety problems with marketed biological products.
This action is similar to initiatives taken by FDA regarding new drugs and medical devices.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adverse experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any adverse event associated with the use of a biological product in humans, whether or not considered product
related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a biological product in professional
practice; an adverse event occurring from overdose of the product, whether accidental or intentional; an adverse
event occurring from abuse of the product; an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure
of expected pharmacological action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Blood Component
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for this purpose has the same meaning as defined in &sect;606.3(c) of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse biological product experience, e.g., an increased
number of reports of a particular adverse biological product experience after appropriate adjustment for biological
product exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse experience associated with the use of a biological product that is fatal or life-threatening, is
permanently disabling, requires inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unexpected
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse biological product experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the product and includes
an event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differs
from the event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis
would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity)
if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of adverse experiences
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Any person having a product license under &sect;601.20 of this chapter shall promptly review all adverse experience
information pertaining to its product obtained or otherwise received by the licensed manufacturer from any source,
foreign or domestic, including information derived from commercial marketing experience, postmarketing clinical
investigations, postmarketing epidemiological/surveillance studies, reports in the scientific literature,
and unpublished scientific papers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Reporting requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report to FDA adverse experience information, as described in this section. The
licensed manufacturer shall submit two copies of each report described in this section for nonvaccine biological
products, to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;210), Food and Drug Administration, 1401
Rockville Pike, suite 200 N., Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448. Submit all vaccine adverse experience reports to:
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), P.O. Box 1100, Rockville, MD 20849&hyph;1100. FDA may waive the
requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Fifteen-day Alert reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected, regardless
of source, as soon as possible but in any case within 15 working days of initial receipt of the information. These reports
are required to be submitted, for nonvaccine biological products, on a form designated by FDA or a suitable format
containing all of the data elements in the FDA designated reporting form, and, for vaccines on a VAERS form. The licensed
manufacturer shall promptly investigate all adverse experiences that are the subject of these 15-day Alert reports
and shall submit followup reports within 15 working days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional
information is not obtainable, a followup report may be required that describes briefly the steps taken to seek additional
information and the reasons why it could not be obtained. These 15-day Alert reports and followups to them are required
to be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a periodic
report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The licensed manufacturer shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the
frequency of reports of adverse biological product experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of
therapeutic failure (lack of effect), regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as
soon as possible but in any case within 15 working days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists.
Upon written notice, FDA may require that licensed manufacturers review the frequency of reports of serious, expected
adverse biological product experiences at intervals different than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant
increase in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time period on which the increased
frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results), rather than using the form designated
by FDA. Fifteen-day Alert reports based on increased frequency are required to be submitted under separate cover
and may not be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, concerning the submission of Fifteen-day
Alert reports, shall also apply to any person other than the licensed manufacturer of the final product whose name
appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer, packer, distributor, shared manufacturer,
joint manufacturer, or any other participant involved in divided manufacturing. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication
in the initial and followup submission of reports to FDA, the obligations of a manufacturer other than the licensed
manufacturer, may be met by submitting all reports to the licensed manufacturer of the final product. If a manufacturer
other than the licensed manufacturer elects to submit reports to the licensed manufacturer rather than to FDA, it
shall submit each report to the licensed manufacturer within 3 working days of its receipt, and the licensed manufacturer
shall then comply with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the manufacturer shall maintain
a record of this action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A copy of all adverse biological product experience reports submitted to the licensed manufacturer,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Date the report was received by the manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Date the report was submitted to the licensed manufacturer,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Name and address of the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report'' or ``15-day Alert report--followup.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Periodic adverse experience reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience not reported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this
section at quarterly intervals, for 3 years from the date of issuance of the product license, and then at annual intervals.
The licensed manufacturer shall submit each quarterly report within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first
quarter beginning on the date of issuance of the product license) and each annual report within 60 days of the anniversary
date of the issuance of the product license. Upon written notice, FDA may extend or reestablish the requirement that
a licensed manufacturer submit quarterly reports, or require that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under
this section at different times than those stated.  Followup information to adverse experiences submitted in a periodic
report may be submitted in the next periodic report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Each periodic report shall contain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A narrative summary and analysis of the information in the report and an analysis of the 15-day Alert reports submitted
during the reporting interval (all 15-day Alert reports being appropriately referenced by the licensed manufacturer's
patient identification number, adverse reaction term(s), and date of submission to FDA);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A form designated for Adverse Experience Reporting by FDA for each adverse experience not reported under paragraph
(c)(1)(i) of this section (with an index consisting of a line listing of the licensed manufacturer's patient identification
number and adverse reaction term(s)); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A history of actions taken since the last report because of adverse experiences (for example, labeling changes
or studies initiated).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Periodic reporting, except for information regarding 15-day Alert reports, does not apply to adverse experience
information obtained from postmarketing studies (whether or not conducted under an investigational new drug application),
from reports in the scientific literature, and from foreign marketing experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Scientific literature
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) A 15-day Alert report based on information from the scientific literature shall be accompanied by a copy of the
published article. The 15-day Alert reporting requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (i.e., serious,
unexpected adverse experiences) apply only to reports found in scientific and medical journals either as case reports
or as the result of a formal clinical trial. The 15-day Alert reporting requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this
section (i.e., a significant increase in frequency of a serious, expected adverse experience or of a therapeutic
failure) apply only to reports found in scientific and medical journals either as the result of a formal clinical trial,
or from epidemiologic studies or analyses of experience in a monitored series of patients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As with all reports submitted under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, reports based on the scientific literature
shall be submitted on the reporting form designated by FDA or comparable format as prescribed by paragraph (f) of this
section. In cases where the licensed manufacturer believes that preparing the form designated by FDA constitutes
an undue hardship, the licensed manufacturer may arrange with the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (HFM&hyph;210)
for an acceptable alternative reporting format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing studies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Licensed manufacturers are not required to submit a 15-day Alert report under paragraph (c) of this section for
an adverse experience obtained from a postmarketing clinical study (whether or not conducted under a biological
investigational new drug application) unless the licensed manufacturer concludes that there is a reasonable possibility
that the product caused the adverse experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The licensed manufacturer shall separate and clearly mark reports of adverse experiences that occur during a
postmarketing study as being distinct from those experiences that are being reported spontaneously to the licensed
manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Reporting forms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), and (f)(3) of this section, the licensed manufacturer shall complete
the reporting form designated by FDA (FDA&hyph;3500A, or, for vaccines, a VAERS form) for each report of an adverse
experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each completed form should refer only to an individual patient or single attached publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Instead of using a designated reporting form, a licensed manufacturer may use a computer-generated form or other
alternative format (e.g., a computer-generated tape or tabular listing) provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The content of the alternative format is equivalent in all elements of information to those specified in the form
designated by FDA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the format is approved in advance by MEDWATCH: The FDA Medical Products Reporting Program; or, for alternatives
to the VAERS Form, by the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Copies of the reporting form designated by FDA (FDA&hyph;3500A) for nonvaccine biological products may be obtained
from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (address above). Additional supplies of the form may be obtained
from the Consolidated Forms and Publications Distribution Center, 3222 Hubbard Rd., Landover, MD 20785. Supplies
of the VAERS form may be obtained from VAERS by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;822&hyph;7967. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Multiple reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A licensed manufacturer should not include in reports under this section any adverse experiences that occurred
in clinical trials if they were previously submitted in the product license application. If a report refers to more
than one biological product marketed by a licensed manufacturer, the licensed manufacturer should submit the report
to the license for the product listed first in the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Patient privacy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For nonvaccine biological products, a licensed manufacturer should not include in reports under this section the
names and addresses of individual patients; instead, the licensed manufacturer should assign a unique code number
to each report, preferably not more than eight characters in length. The licensed manufacturer should include the
name of the reporter from whom the information was received. The names of patients, health care professionals, hospitals,
and geographical identifiers in adverse experience reports are not releasable to the public under FDA's public information
regulations in part 20 this of chapter. For vaccine adverse experience reports, these data will become part of the
CDC Privacy Act System 09&hyph;20&hyph;0136, ``Epidemiologic Studies and Surveillance of Disease Problems.''
Information identifying the person who received the vaccine or that person's legal representative will not be made
available to the public, but may be available to the vaccinee or legal representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall maintain for a period of 10 years records of all adverse experiences known to the
licensed manufacturer, including raw data and any correspondence relating to the adverse experiences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Guideline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA has prepared a guideline for the submission of reports of adverse experiences and suggested followup investigation
of reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Revocation of license
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a licensed manufacturer fails to establish and maintain records and make reports required under this section
with respect to a licensed biological product, FDA may revoke the product license for such a product in accordance
with the procedures of &sect;601.5 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Disclaimer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A report or information submitted by a licensed manufacturer under this section (and any release by FDA of that report
or information) does not necessarily reflect a conclusion by the licensed manufacturer or FDA that the report or information
constitutes an admission that the biological product caused or contributed to an adverse effect. A licensed manufacturer
need not admit, and may deny, that the report or information submitted under this section constitutes an admission
that the biological product caused or contributed to an adverse effect. For purposes of this provision, this paragraph
also includes any person reporting under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensed manufacturer shall submit information about the quantity of the product distributed under the product
license, including the quantity distributed to distributors. The interval between distribution reports shall
be 6 months. Upon written notice, FDA may require that the licensed manufacturer submit distribution reports under
this section at times other than every 6 months. The distribution report shall consist of the bulk lot number (from
which the final container was filled), the fill lot numbers for the total number of dosage units of each strength or
potency distributed (e.g., fifty thousand per 10-milliliter vials), the label lot number (if different from fill
lot number), labeled date of expiration, number of doses in fill lot/label lot, date of release of fill lot/label lot
for distribution at that time. If any significant amount of a fill lot/label lot is returned, include this information.
Disclosure of financial or pricing data is not required. As needed, FDA may require submission of more detailed product
distribution information. Upon written notice, FDA may require that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under
this section at times other than those stated. Requests by a licensed manufacturer to submit reports at times other
than those stated should be made as a request for a waiver under &sect;600.90.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule will not: (1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule; (2) Have any retroactive effect; and (3) Require administrative proceedings before parties
may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The REA program provides loans to REA Borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than those generally
available from the private sector. REA Borrowers, as a result of obtaining federal financing, receive economic benefits
which ultimately offset any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements.
Moreover, this action is in response to the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 20, 1993, REA published an interim rule (58 FR 66250) to incorporate changes to telephone loan policies
required by the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993 (RELRA) (107 Stat. 1356). RELRA amended several
provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (RE Act), and mandated a restructuring of the telephone loan program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 13, 1994, REA adopted its interim rule as a final rule (59 FR 17460) with one exception, 7 CFR Part 1751, Telecommunications
System Planning and Design Criteria, and Procedures. Because of the overwhelming response and concerns regarding
the requirements of the State Telecommunications Modernization Plan (Modernization Plan), REA is proposing to
amend 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As revised, this Rule would require that Modernization Plans, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization
Plan is developed by the PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization
Plan's requirements apply to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not
to include non-REA borrowers will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also,
at its option, extend coverage of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers
in the State. In addition, while requirements contained in &sect;1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State
Legislature or PUC, at its discretion, may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications
services in a State as it deems appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is REA's policy that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's Public
Switched Network. If the Plan Developer is either the State Legislature or the PUC, such entity must submit for REA
approval its Modernization Plan by a date one year from issuance of the Final Rule. After this date, if a State or its
PUC declines or fails to submit for REA approval its Modernization Plan, eligibility to develop the Plan passes to
a numeric majority of the Borrowers within the State. While there is no time limit requiring States to have an approved
plan in place, REA, as required by RELRA, will not approve any direct loans in States without such a plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period, REA received 81 comments regarding the interim rule, and these comments were taken into
consideration in preparing the proposed amendments. Comments were received from the following:

REA should not specify specific technologies.

Response:

This was a nearly unanimous comment and one with which REA concurs. REA's intent is to specify information carrying
capability, i.e., bit rate. References to specific technologies, like ISDN, have been removed.

Many commenters believe that the use of the word ``objectives'' in RELRA implies non-binding guidelines. REA believes
the commenters are taking the word out of context. The entire provision is as follows:

``REQUIREMENTS._For purposes of subparagraph (A), a telecommunications modernization plan must, at a minimum,
meet the following objectives.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA believes that an objective that must be met is mandatory. In the interim regulation (7 CFR part 1751, published
December 20, 1993), REA set forth both ``requirements'' and ``objectives'' to be contained in the Modernization
Plan. Requirements were to be binding while objectives were only goals or targets. This may have led to confusion because
both words are used in RELRA. In the proposed rule, REA has included only requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA went beyond the intent of RELRA by establishing timeframes for modernization.

REA set timeframes because a requirement with no due date is not a requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA believes that advanced telecommunications services should be available to the public within a reasonable time
after they are developed. Broad experience in bringing modern telephone service to rural America teaches the value
of caution and reflection before imposing binding requirements on future business activities. Varying construction
schedules, economic conditions and rates of technological innovation affect even the most careful projections.
REA conservatively projected the reasonably expected growth of both the public's need for telecommunications services
and the ability of Telecommunications Providers and equipment manufacturers to provide those services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA consulted both its past experience and its expectations of future technological development before setting
the short-, medium- and long-term deadlines in the regulation. Our experience with new technology such as buried
cable, digital switching, and fiber optic systems where the widespread deployment into the telecommunications
network took two to five years, lead us to adopt the five year phase-in concept. The timetable is achievable, given
the telecommunications services presently available, the resources of the Telecommunications Providers, and
the accelerating engineering achievements likely in the next few years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations phase in the requirements in three steps to provide for an orderly deployment of these telecommunications
services. Facilities constructed more than one year after REA approves a Modernization Plan are required to provide
those services that can be produced by equipment now in existence. The one year delay allows for construction-in-progress
to be completed before the Modernization Plan requirements go into effect. The requirements for the medium and long
terms simply expand the coverage of the requirements so that when the long term period (11&hyph;16 years) is reached,
all subscribers will have the services deployed during the short term period available to them.

c. Comment Summary:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RELRA does not require that telecommunications improvements be deployed ``concurrently'' in rural and nonrural
areas but only that ``the plan must provide for uniform deployment schedules to ensure that advanced services are
deployed at the same time in rural and nonrural areas''.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters thought that REA intended all improvements to be made simultaneously throughout a service area.
REA understands that there is a logical order to providing improvements and that they will often happen first in nonrural
areas. REA intends that they should be deployed and available at approximately the same time in rural and nonrural
areas. For example, if digital switching technology is being deployed in a nonrural area, replacement switches in
rural areas would also employ digital technology. This does not mean that if a switch was replaced in a nonrural area,
a switch would have to be replaced in the rural area. In the proposed rule, REA has clarified this requirement. See &sect;1751.106(a).

d. Comment Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA has no basis for requiring either the elimination of mileage and/or zone charges or that Telecommunications Providers
adopt flexible tariffs. These issues concern rates and are not ``service standards''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The stated requirement in RELRA is the elimination of party line service. REA's experience has been that imposing
zone and mileage charges on one-party service creates a large disincentive for subscribers to choose this service.
However, REA will not require the Modernization Plan contain a provision to eliminate zone and mileage charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RELRA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
provides that the Modernization Plan ``must provide for the availability of telecommunications services for improved
business, educational, and medical services.'' Rigid rate structures have served as the primary impediment to the
provision of distance learning and medical link services. REA has seen cases where states have set wideband rates
in direct proportion to the voiceband rate resulting in, for example, rates for schools far beyond what they can afford.
REA has clarified its intent on this subject in &sect;1751.106(e).

REA concurs and has given the Plan Developer some discretion in this matter. Section 1751.106(g)(2)(ii) has been
revised to allow a Telecommunications Provider to request additional time from the Plan Developer in the case of a
PUC or State Legislature developed plan, or from the REA in the case of a REA Borrower developed plan. The Plan Developer
or REA, as the case may be, must consider each request separately and can grant additional time only if either the best
available telecommunications technology lacks the capability to enable the Telecommunications Provider to comply
with the non-loaded requirement or complying with the requirement would impose prohibitive cost on the Telecommunications
Provider.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the interim rule, all references to provision of 150 Mb/sec service were non-binding ``objectives'', see paragraph
2a. REA focused on the requirement in RELRA that telephone lines be capable of carrying at least 1,000,000 bits per
second. REA adjusted this to the standard North American rate of 1.544 Mb/sec. Such a rate allows for both the transmission
of at least 1 million bits per second and for the transmission of modest quality, highly compressed video. A higher
rate is not required by the proposed rule.

 REA interprets the Modernization Plan requirements of RELRA to apply to service provided by telephone lines, i.e.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule violates section 202 of the RE Act which states that nothing in the RE Act shall be construed to deprive
any State commission of jurisdiction to regulate telephone service, including the rates for such service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA believes there is no conflict between RELRA and section 202 of the RE Act. The PUC is neither required to develop
a Modernization Plan nor to approve REA loans that are consistent with a Modernization Plan whoever is the Plan Developer.
Therefore the PUC's jurisdiction to regulate telephone service is not impaired. No change has been made to the regulation
based on this comment.

6. Comment Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA has not considered how the proposed services can be offered at affordable rates. The regulation could result in
an REA Borrower-developed Modernization Plan which requires investments that a PUC would not approve.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements included in the proposed regulation apply almost entirely to new construction. New construction
has to be economically justified to receive either REA financing or PUC approval for inclusion in the rate base. REA
believes strongly in universal service and would not issue a regulation which it believed to be an impediment to that
goal. No change has been made to the regulation based on these comments.

 As redrafted, the Modernization Plan must apply only to REA Borrowers unless a PUC or a State Legislature decides,
at its option, to apply the Modernization Plan to non-REA Borrower Telecommunications Providers. The REA does, however,
encourage the PUCs and State Legislatures to apply the Modernization Plans to all Telecommunications Providers
in the State.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The modern telecommunications system envisioned by RELRA and the Modernization Plan requirements can succeed only
if it is supported by market demand. REA's electric and telecommunications programs have repeatedly demonstrated
how quickly rural America takes advantage of new utility services. RELRA and the Modernization Plans lead the way
for today's nonrural and rural subscribers to receive the modern telecommunications services they want and need.
REA believes that the Modernization Plan requirements of this regulation rest on a sound economic basis. True to its
statutory mandate, REA will finance projects only if it believes there is adequate security and the loan will be repaid
within the time agreed.

11. Comment Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is untimely for REA to develop a rule when other laws concerning telecommunications have been introduced in Congress.
It is inappropriate for REA to develop rules for telecommunications. That should be the responsibility of the FCC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA, as the agency responsible for promoting rural telecommunications, has long experience in setting the engineering
and technical standards for service in rural areas and is ideally suited for the responsibility it was given by Congress.
REA is working to ensure that Modernization Plan requirements and the Proposed Rule governing their preparation
are flexible enough to accommodate evolving national policies promoting the National Information Infrastructure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA will revise, within our statutory constraints, these regulations and approve amendments to Modernization Plans
if the National Information Infrastructure develops along lines not presently envisioned. However, the legislative
imperative of RELRA and rural America's urgent need for modern telecommunications services require that the regulations
not be delayed.

Comment Summary:

The rule is not clear on Plan Developer eligibility as related to time. The law says the one year period starts after
publication of the final rule. Can Borrowers submit a Modernization Plan before the end of the year if the PUC or State
Legislature does not intend to? What if a PUC or State Legislature submits a Modernization Plan on the last day? Won't
loans be delayed if a PUC or State Legislature does not develop a plan and an REA Borrower-developed one has not been
approved?

RELRA sets forth the method of determining Plan Developer eligibility. With regard to the specific points mentioned
above: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The one year period starts with publication of the final rule developed in response to comments on this proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A Modernization Plan submitted on the last day will be approved by REA if it meets the minimum requirements without
alteration. The proposed rule includes language which recommends that to ensure a PUC or a State Legislature has sufficient
time to respond to any REA comments on its proposed Modernization Plan, the PUC or State Legislature should submit
its plan at least 90 days in advance of the expiration of its eligibility. See &sect;1751.104(b)(2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA believes that the lack of consensus on how to bring wider band switched service to the home and small business, particularly
in rural areas, means that Telecommunications Providers continue to build and rebuild their systems essentially
for traditional voiceband service. In many cases this plant can not be adapted to wider band services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim rule (dated December 20, 1993) REA had required a ``generic design'' for broadband service. Since REA
is no longer including non-binding goals in the proposed regulation, the requirement for a generic design has been
changed to a requirement for the developer to provide a strategic development proposal which provides the Plan Developer's
vision of a State telecommunications structure for the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to local power, REA retains a concern over system reliability. The proposed rule requires that no matter
what level of service is being offered, sufficient system power must be available to provide voice service during
electric utility outages. See &sect;1751.106(h)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv).

General Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is REA's belief that national telecommunications ``highways'' will not and cannot be fully utilized unless improvements
are made to what might be called the telecommunications ``driveways'', the local loops. Most loops cannot transmit
information over 9600 bits per second (b/s). Consequently, many advanced telecommunications services are not available
on the Public Switched Network or, where available, operate only on short loops. This limits use of these advanced
services to densely populated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RELRA requires that telephone lines be capable of transmitting: (1) Information at no less than 1,000,000 bits per
second (1Mb/s) and (2) video images. REA believes both requirements can be satisfied by telephone lines which can
transmit and receive 1.544 Mb/s, the North American standard digital transmission rate. This rate is sufficient
to carry both 1 million bits per second and highly compressed, modest quality video. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To carry 1.544 Mb/sec, the capacity of ordinary telephone loops must be increased by several orders of magnitude.
The other requirements in the law are more easily met. Therefore, improving the loop has been REA's focus in preparing
minimum Modernization Plan requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA believes that the requirements and time limits set forth in this section will achieve the service standards of
RELRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, REA is concerned about coordination between States. REA recommends that Modernization Plan Developers
should work with Plan Developers in other States both before and after their Modernization Plans are approved to coordinate
proposed improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA recommends that Modernization Plan Developers give consideration to planning for outside plant which can ultimately
provide future broadband Wireline Service with a bandwidth equivalent to a digital rate on the order of 150 Mb/sec.
Such facilities could carry one or more channels of conventional video with the quality depending on the modulation
technique.

(a) It is the policy of REA that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's
Public Switched Network. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) A proposed Modernization Plan must be submitted to REA for approval. REA will approve the proposed Modernization
Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart. Once obtained, REA's approval of a Modernization Plan cannot
be rescinded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) The Modernization Plan shall not interfere with REA's authority to issue such other telecommunications standards,
specifications, requirements, and procurement rules as may be promulgated from time to time by REA including, without
limitation, those set forth in 7 CFR part 1755. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) The Modernization Plan must, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization Plan is developed by the
PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization Plan's requirements apply
to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not to include non-REA borrowers
will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also, at its option, extend coverage
of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers in the State. In addition, while
requirements contained in &sect;1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State Legislature or PUC, at its discretion,
may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications services in a State as it deems appropriate.

 to develop a proposed Modernization Plan and deliver it to REA. REA will review and consider for approval all PUC or
State Legislature-developed Modernization Plans received by REA within this one year period. The review and approval,
if any, may occur after the one year period ends even though the PUC or State Legislature is no longer eligible to submit
a proposed Modernization Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) The PUC must notify all Telecommunications Providers in the State that are part of the Public Switched Network
and other interested parties of its intent to develop a proposed Modernization Plan. The PUC is encouraged to consider
all such Providers' and interested parties' views and incorporate these views in the Modernization Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) If the State Legislature or PUC is no longer eligible to develop a Modernization Plan, as described in paragraph

For information about loan eligibility requirements in relation to the Modernization Plan, see 7 CFR part 1735. In
particular, one year after publication of the final rule, REA will make hardship loans, REA cost-of-money loans,
and RTB loans for facilities and other RE Act purposes for Telephone Borrowers in a State only if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (a) The State has an REA approved Modernization Plan; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) The Borrower is participating in the Modernization Plan for the State. A Borrower is considered to be participating
if, in REA's opinion, the purposes of the loan requested by the Borrower are consistent with the Borrower achieving
the requirements stated in the Modernization Plan within the timeframe stated in the Modernization Plan unless REA
has determined that achieving the requirements is not technically or economically feasible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) To obtain REA approval of a proposed Modernization Plan, the Plan Developer must submit the following to REA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) A certified copy of the statute or PUC order, if the State is the Plan Developer, or a written request for REA approval
of the proposed Modernization Plan signed by an authorized representative of the Plan Developer, if a majority of
Borrowers is the Plan Developer; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Three copies of the proposed Modernization Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) Generally, REA will review the proposed Modernization Plan within (30) days and either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Approve the Modernization Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart in which case REA will return a copy
of the Modernization Plan with notice of approval to the Plan Developer; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Not approve the proposed Modernization Plan if it does not conform to the provisions of this subpart. In this event,
REA will return the proposed Modernization Plan to the Plan Developer with specific written comments and suggestions
for modifying the proposed Modernization Plan so that it will conform to the provisions of this subpart. If the Plan
Developer remains eligible, REA will invite the Plan Developer to submit a modified proposed Modernization Plan
for REA consideration. This process can continue until the Plan Developer gains approval of a proposed Modernization
Plan unless the Plan Developer is a PUC or State Legislature whose eligibility has expired. If the PUC's or State Legislature's
eligibility has expired, REA will return the proposed Modernization Plan unapproved. Because REA does not have authority
to extend a PUC's or State Legislature's eligibility, REA recommends that a PUC or State Legislature submit a proposed
Modernization Plan at least 90 days in advance of one year after publication of the final rule to allow time for this
process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) REA understands that changes in standards, technology, regulation, and the economy could indicate that an REA-approved
Modernization Plan should be amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) The Plan Developer of the Modernization Plan may amend the Modernization Plan if REA finds the proposed changes

that REA believes represent more desirable goals for the future course of telecommunications services. Such revisions
will be made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. These revisions shall not invalidate Modernization
Plans approved by REA but shall be used by REA to determine whether to approve amendments to Modernization Plans presented
for REA approval after the effective date of the revision.

This proposed rule requires that employees hired by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR or Agency)
be citizens of the United States of America. This rule exempts EOIR from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986's
general prohibition of discrimination based on citizenship status and supplements Executive Order 11935 which
requires United States citizenship for almost all Federal employees in the competitive service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
supplementary information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule authorizes EOIR to require its employees and volunteers to be citizens of the United States of America.
Because the central task of this Agency is adjudicating immigration-related cases, Agency employees and volunteers
often have access to sensitive information and handle complex and sensitive immigration issues. It is imperative
that individuals who work at EOIR, either as employees or volunteers, demonstrate their allegiance to the United
States by being able to document that they are United States citizens. Pursuant to E.O. 11935, 41 FR 37301 (1976), the
Executive Branch requires United States citizenship for employees hired in the competitive service. This proposed
rule extends the citizenship requirement to all EOIR employees and volunteers. The rule exempts EOIR from the prohibition
of discrimination based on citizenship status, pursuant to the procedures established by the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(2)(C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, this proposed rule allows the Agency to exercise its discretion to hire non-citizens when necessary
to accomplish the Agency's mission. For example, this rule would permit the Director of the Agency to authorize hiring
an interpreter skilled in the English language and an unusual foreign language when a United States citizen interpreter
is not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insertion of this rule requires a slight reorganization of 8 CFR part 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with E.O. 12866 section 1(b), Principles of Regulation. The
Attorney General has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under E.O. 12866, section
3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with E.O. 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implication to
warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission is publishing a notice to establish a proposed system notice to establish a new system of records, FEC
12, ``Office of Inspector General Investigative Files,'' under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The following
proposed amendment of the Commission's Privacy Act regulations at 11 CFR 1.14 is necessary to exempt the new system
of records from certain provisions of that Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Privacy Act and the implementing regulations require, among other things, that the Commission provide notice
when collecting information, account for certain disclosures, permit individuals access to their records, and
allow them to request that the records be amended. These provisions could interfere with the conduct of OIG investigations
if applied to the OIG's maintenance of the proposed system of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission proposes to exempt FEC 12 from these requirements under sections (j)(2) and (k)(2) of
the Act. Section (j)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), exempts a system of records maintained by ``the agency or component
thereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to enforcement of criminal laws *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Section (k)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), exempts a system of records consisting of ``investigatory materials compiled
for law enforcement purposes,'' where such materials are not within the scope of the (j)(2) exemption pertaining
to criminal law enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed system of records consists of information covered by the (j)(2) and (k)(2) exemptions. the OIG investigatory
files are maintained pursuant to official investigational and law enforcement functions of the Commission's Office
of Inspector General under authority of the 1988 amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public Law 100&hyph;504, amending Public Law 95&hyph;452, 5 U.S.C. app. The OIG is an office within the Commission
that performs as one of its principal functions activities relating to the enforcement of criminal laws. In addition,
the OIG is responsible for investigating a wide range of non-criminal law enforcement matters, including civil,
administrative, or regulatory violations and similar wrongdoing. Access by subject individuals and others to this
system of records could substantially compromise the effectiveness of OIG investigations, and thus impede the apprehension
and successful prosecution or discipline of persons engaged in fraud or other illegal activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Commission is proposing to exempt proposed FEC 12 under exemptions (j)(2) and (k)(2) of the
Privacy Act, by adding a new paragraph (b) to 11 CFR 1.14, the section in which the Commission specifies its systems

from any Privacy Act provision except: 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) (conditions of disclosure); (c) (1) and (2) (accounting of
disclosures and retention of accounting, respectively); (e)(4) (A) through (F) (system notice requirements);
(e) (6), (7), (8), (10) and (11) (certain agency requirements relating to system maintenance); and (i) (criminal
penalties). Section (k)(2) may be invoked to exempt a system of records from: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (making accounting
of disclosures available to the subject individual); (d) (access to records); (e)(1) (maintaining only relevant
and necessary information; (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) (notice of certain procedures), and (f) (promulgation of certain
Privacy Act rules). The proposed language notes these specific exceptions and exemptions.

and individuals are not ``small entities'' within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On August 30, 1994, SBA published a proposed rule to, among other things, (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility
requirements for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical
experience gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought
before SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community
Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a)
contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and
national buy 8(a) requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule required that comments concerning its proposed provisions be submitted to SBA for review on or before November
28, 1994. SBA has received a number of comments stating that the 30-day comment period was insufficient to properly
address all of the proposal, and requesting that the comment period be extended. In light of the fact that the end of
the comment period coincided with the end of the Federal fiscal year, a very busy time for any business concerns contracting
with the Federal Government, SBA concurs that an extension of the comment period for this rule is appropriate. Thus,
SBA is extending the comment period for an additional 30 days from the date this notice is published in the

TVA proposes to amend its administrative cost recovery regulations by: Adding a provision requiring payment to TVA
of nonrefundable application processing fees to recover the costs of reviewing plans for the construction, operation,
or maintenance of dams, appurtenant works, or other obstructions affecting navigation, flood control, or public
lands or reservations in the Tennessee River system under Section 26a of the TVA Act; eliminating cost recovery exemptions
for agricultural licenses; firewood cutting permits; permits for the nonexclusive short-term use of TVA land; conveyance
or abandonment of TVA land or landrights to States, municipalities, and political subdivisions and agencies thereof;
and use of TVA land for utility line crossings; authorizing the responsible land manager to establish a standard charge
for each category of action rather than determining the actual administrative costs for each individual action;
increasing the range of fees for certain actions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to help ensure that TVA land management and permitting activities are self-sustaining to the full extent
possible, the agency has determined that its administrative cost recovery regulations should be expanded to include
a broader range of use, disposal, and permitting activities. This determination is consistent with the objectives
of the current administration to increase government efficiency and to recover the costs of government services
from those who most directly benefit from the services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons who wish to construct dams, appurtenant works, or other obstructions in or along the Tennessee River system
are required by Section 26a of the TVA Act of 1933, as amended, to obtain TVA's approval of plans for the proposed activity
prior to construction. TVA's administrative cost recovery regulations currently provide for recovery of costs
of actions taken by TVA to approve obstructions constructed without prior approval of plans. In order to help ensure
that the agency's entire Section 26a permitting program is self-sustaining to the full extent possible, TVA now proposes
to recover the costs of processing permits for proposed obstructions as well as after-the-fact permit processing.
The proposed amendment would allow the responsible land manager to set a standard permit processing fee, which would
be payable upon submission of a permit application and would be nonrefundable, regardless of whether or not the plans
are approved by TVA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is presently envisioned that the standard application processing fee for private noncommercial Section 26a permit
proposals would be $100, and the standard fee for commercial, industrial, and public Section 26a permit application
processing would be $500. These proposed fees are based in part upon a preliminary review of costs incurred by TVA in
processing these permits. In addition, TVA examined prevailing permit application fees by conducting a comparative
analysis survey of 40 other agencies and utilities. In adjusting application processing fees and in establishing
standard fees for other applicable activities, the responsible land manager will examine average costs incurred
in conducting the various activities.

TVA presently charges a $2 per applicant administrative fee for quota deer hunts and quota turkey hunts at Land Between
The Lakes. The purpose of this fee is to recover the cost of processing applications, conducting a computerized drawing,
and mailing notification of selection status. TVA proposes the application fee increase from $2 to a range of $5 to
$25. This range will allow TVA to recover increasing costs of conducting the drawings and hunts, and allow a range of
pricing for special hunts and drawings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 24, 1994, (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576), Texas submitted a proposed amendment to its
program pursuant to SMCRA. Texas submitted the proposed amendment in response to required program amendments at
30 CFR 943.16(c) (1) and (2), (d), (f), (j)(1), (2), (3), and (4), (r), and (s) (59 FR 13200, March 21, 1994). The ownership
and control provisions of the Texas Coal Mining Regulations (TCMR) at 16 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) &sect;11.221
and of the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (TSCMRA) at Article 5920&hyph;11 of the Texas Revised Civil
Statutes Annotated that Texas proposed to amend were: TCMR &sect;778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance
information; TCMR &sect;786.215(e) and (f), review of permit applications; TCMR 786.216(i) through (n), criteria
for permit approval or denial; TCMR &sect;788.225(f), (g), and (h), commission review of outstanding permits; and
section 21(c) of TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the June 30, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 33705) and invited public comment on its adequacy (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.07). The public
comment period ended August 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of the rules and statute at
TCMR &sect;778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance information; TCMR &sect;786.215(e)(1), review
of permit applications; TCMR &sect;788.225(g), commission review of outstanding permits; and section 21(c) of
TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications. OSM notified Texas of the concerns by letter dated
August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.12). In response to OSM's concerns for these provisions,
Texas, in a letter dated October 6, 1994, submitted a revised amendment (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas proposes to additionally (1) revise TCMR &sect;778.116(m) and TCMR &sect;786.215(e)(1) so that each requires
an application to list violations incurred by the applicant under all SMCRA-approved State programs, including
the Texas program; (2) recodify the previously proposed second sentence of TCMR &sect;788.225(g) as (g)(1) and subparagraphs
(g) (1) through (4) as (g)(1) (i) through (iv); (3) revise TCMR &sect;788.225(g) to provide that if the Commission
elects to rescind an improvidently issued permit it must serve the permittee with a notice of the proposed rescission
and include the reasons under TCMR &sect;788.225(e) for the Commission's findings; (4) revise TCMR &sect;788.225(g)(g)(1)(iv)
to require the Commission to find that, in addition to severing any ownership or control link with the responsible
person, the permittee does not continue to be responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee; and (5) recodify previously
proposed TCMR &sect;788.225(h) and (i), respectively, as TCMR &sect;788.225(g)(2) and (h).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Texas program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to
reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Texas program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 AND 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

 EPA today proposes to designate an Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site (ODMDS) in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Miami,
Florida, as an EPA-approved ocean dumping site for the disposal of suitable dredged material. This proposed action
is necessary to provide an acceptable ocean disposal site for consideration as an option for dredged material disposal
projects in the greater Miami, Florida vicinity. This proposed site designation is for an indefinite period of time,
but the site is subject to continuing monitoring to insure that unacceptable adverse environmental impacts do not
occur.

gives the Administrator of EPA the authority to designate sites where ocean disposal may be permitted. On October
1, 1986, the Administrator delegated the authority to designate ocean disposal sites to the Regional Administrator
of the Region in which the sites are located. This proposed designation of a site offshore Miami, Florida, which is
within Region IV, is being made pursuant to that authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations promulgated under MPRSA (40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H, Section 228.4) state that
ocean dumping sites will be designated by promulgation in this Part 228. A list of ``Approved Interim and Final Ocean
Dumping Sites'' was published on January 11, 1977 (42 FR 2461 [January 11, 1977]). The list established the existing
Miami (``Miami Beach'') site as an interim site. The site is now listed in 40 CFR 228.12(a)(3). Interested persons
may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written comments within 45 days of the date of this publication
to the address given above.

., requires that federal agencies prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on proposals for legislation
and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The object of NEPA
is to build into the Agency decision making process careful consideration of all environmental aspects of proposed
actions. While NEPA does not apply to EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarily committed to prepare EISs in
connection with ocean disposal site designations such as this (see 39 FR 16186 [May 7, 1974]). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, in cooperation with the Jacksonville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), has prepared a Draft
EIS (DEIS) entitled ``Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Designation of An Ocean Dredged Material Disposal
Site Located Offshore Miami, Florida.'' On September 7, 1990, the Notice of Availability (NOA) of the DEIS for public
review and comment was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 36891 [September 7, 1990]). Anyone desiring a copy of the EIS may obtain one from the addresses given above. The
public comment period on the draft EIS was to have closed on October 22, 1990. However, the closing date was changed
to December 7, 1990 due to a request by the State of Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received 12 comment letters on the Draft EIS. There were three main concerns expressed in those letters: (1) Placement
of beach quality sand in the ODMDS; (2) potential for movement of silt and clay sized particles out of the disposal area
and onto environmentally sensitive hardbottoms and coral reefs to the west during the occurrence of Gulf Stream frontal
eddies; and (3) disposal of contaminated sediments from locations such as the Miami River. Concerns raised by the
State of Florida, regarding use of suitable material for beach nourishment, will be addressed in the FEIS. EPA concurs
with the State of Florida regarding the use of suitable material for beach nourishment, in circumstances where this
use is practical. A real-time monitoring system will be instituted by the Army Corps of Engineers to identify the occurrence
of Gulf Stream frontal eddies. During the occurrence of such eddies, disposal at the ODMDS will discontinue. Details
of the monitoring plan and protocol will be included in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the FEIS.
Before any material can be placed within an ODMDS, it must be evaluated and shown to be acceptable for ocean disposal
in accordance with ocean dumping regulations (40 CFR 227.13). Certain portions of the sediments proposed to be dredged
from the Miami River have been found to be unacceptable for ocean disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will serve as a Biological Assessment for purposes of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act coordination.
By itself, site designation of the Miami ODMDS will not adversely impact any threatened or endangered species under
the purview of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Use of the
ODMDS is not expected to adversely impact any threatened or endangered species. Pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered
Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has been asked by EPA to concur with EPA's conclusion that
this site designation will not affect the endangered species under their jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the proposed site designation for consistency with the State of Florida's (the State) approved
coastal management program. EPA has determined that the designation of the proposed site is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the State coastal management program, and has submitted this determination to the State
for review in accordance with EPA policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated September 13, 1990, the Florida Department of State agreed that the proposed designation will have
no effect on any archaeological or historic sites or properties listed, or eligible for listing, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Register of Historic Places
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in accordance with the National Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89&hyph;6654), as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action discussed in the DEIS is the permanent designation for continuing use of the existing interim
ocean disposal site near Miami, Florida. The purpose of the proposed action is to provide an environmentally acceptable
option for the ocean disposal of dredged material. The need for the permanent designation of the Miami ODMDS is based
on a demonstrated COE need for ocean disposal of maintenance dredged material from the Federal navigation projects
in the greater Miami area. However, every disposal activity by the COE is evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine
the need for ocean disposal for that particular case. The need for ocean disposal for other projects, and the suitability
of the material for ocean disposal, will be determined on a case-by-case basis as part of the COE's process of issuing
permits for ocean disposal for private/federal actions and a public review process for their own actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Miami ODMDS, the COE and EPA would evaluate all federal dredged material disposal projects pursuant to the
EPA criteria given in the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Parts 220&hyph;229) and the COE regulations (33 CFR 209.120
and Parts 335&hyph;338). The COE also issues Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) permits to
private applicants for the transport of dredged material intended for disposal after compliance with regulations
is determined. EPA has the right to disapprove any ocean disposal project if, in its judgment, all provisions of MPRSA
and the associated implementing regulations have not been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEIS discusses the need for this site designation and examines ocean disposal site alternatives to the proposed
action. Non-ocean disposal options have been examined in the previously published Feasibility Report and EIS for
the Miami Harbor Channel Project. Alternatives to ocean disposal may include upland disposal within the port area,
disposal in Biscayne Bay, and beach disposal. Upland disposal in the intensively developed Port of Miami-Biscayne
Bay area has not been found feasible. The Port of Miami itself is built partially on fill in Biscayne Bay. Undeveloped
areas within cost-effective haul distances are environmentally valuable in their own right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all inshore waters of the Biscayne Bay area are part of the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve. The waters of the southern
portion of Biscayne Bay, now included in the Aquatic Preserve, are to be incorporated, along with some offshore waters,
into the Biscayne National Park in the near future. The Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (DER) has
afforded the waters of these areas special protection as Outstanding Florida Waters. This effectively removes virtually
all of the Biscayne Bay area from consideration for disposal of dredged material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dredged sand might be placed on beaches in the Miami Beach area. Suitable rock might be placed in nearshore waters.
These options are feasible only where a substantial quantity of the desired type of material is separable from silt
or other undesirable material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COE has been authorized to deepen Miami Harbor. For that project, environmental and economic analyses were performed
and an EIS was prepared. The COE examined and documented the feasibility of each of the above-described disposal options
and found none to be feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following ocean disposal alternatives were evaluated in the Draft EIS:

shelf. Disposal operations on the shelf could adversely impact this reef habitat. Because the shelf is narrow, about
3.3 nmi (6 km) off Government Cut, the transport of dredged materials for disposal beyond the shelf is both practical
and economically feasible. Therefore, alternative sites on the continental shelf are not desirable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The western edge of the Gulf Stream meanders about one mile east of the candidate site. Dumping in the Gulf Stream was
considered, but the enormous task and expense of monitoring disposal under such conditions caused sufficient concern
to eliminate that option.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the ``no action'' alternative, the interim site would not receive final designation. The Water Resources Act
of 1992, Title V, Section 506(a) prohibits the continued use of ocean dump sites which have not been designated by EPA
as Section 102 dump sites after January 1, 1997. If EPA fails to designate the Miami ODMDS by that date, the continued
foreseeable need to have an appropriate site for disposal of suitable sediments from dredging projects in the Miami
area would place pressure on the Corps and EPA to approve on a project-by-project basis the use of temporary ocean dumping
locations pursuant to either Clean Water Act Section 404 or MPRSA Section 103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEIS presents the information needed to evaluate the suitability of ocean disposal areas for final designation
use and is based on one of a series of disposal site environmental studies. The environmental studies and final designation
are being conducted in accordance with the requirements of MPRSA, the Ocean Dumping Regulations, and other applicable
federal environmental legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received on the DEIS will be addressed in the FEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Proposed Rule is being published between the DEIS and the Final EIS (FEIS). EPA will accept comments on the Proposed
Rule during the 45-day NEPA review period. Comments on the Proposed Rule will be addressed in the Final Rule, which
will be published following the completion of the 30-day NEPA review period of the FEIS. Responses in the Final Rule

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Ocean Dumping Regulations, 40 CFR Part 228.5, five general criteria are used in the selection and approval
for continuing use of ocean disposal sites. Sites are selected so as to minimize interference with other marine activities,
to prevent any temporary perturbations associated with the disposal from causing impacts outside the disposal site,
and to permit effective monitoring to detect any adverse impacts at an early stage. Where feasible, locations off
the Continental Shelf and other sites that have been historically used are to be chosen. If, at any time, disposal operations
at a site cause unacceptable adverse impacts, further use of the site can be restricted or terminated by EPA. The proposed
site conforms to the five general criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these general criteria in Section 228.5, Section 228.6 lists the 11 specific criteria used in evaluating
a proposed disposal site to assure that the general criteria are met. Application of these 11 criteria constitutes
an environmental assessment of the impact of disposal at the site. The characteristics of the proposed site are reviewed
below in terms of these 11 criteria (the EIS may be consulted for additional information).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the area's species spend their adult lives in the offshore region, but are estuary-dependent because their
juvenile stages use a low salinity estuarine nursery region. Specific migration routes are not known in the Miami
area. The site is not known to include any major breeding or spawning area, except for sea turtles which use the entire
beach area of eastern Florida as nesting habitat. Due to the motility of finfish, it is unlikely that disposal activities
will have any significant impact on any of the species found in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas [40 CFR 228.6(a)(3)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The candidate site is located at least 3.6 nautical miles from the coast. Shore-related amenities include Virginia
Key, the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve, Biscayne National Park, and the Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Recreational
Area. Currents in the vicinity trend alongshore in a general north-south orientation. It is therefore unlikely that
detectable quantities of dredged material will be transported onto beaches. Considering the distance that the proposed
disposal site is offshore of beach areas, dredged material disposal at the site is not expected to have an effect on
the recreational uses of these beaches. Modelling performed by the COE indicates that disposed material will not
impact these areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is anticipated that the candidate site will be used primarily for disposal of maintenance material from the Port
of Miami. Maintenance dredging has only occurred four times since 1957. Another foreseen use of the site would be the
Miami Harbor Deepening Project. Estimated volume for this project is expected to be 6 million cubic yards. For each
future dredging project, each disposal plan must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that ocean disposal
is the best alternative and that the material meets the Ocean Dumping Criteria in 40 CFR Part 227. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring [40 CFR 228.6(a)(5)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the proximity of the site to shore, surveillance will not be difficult. Survey vessels, dredges or aircraft
overflights are feasible surveillance methods. However, the depths at this site make conventional ODMDS monitoring
techniques difficult to utilize. The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the Miami ODMDS has been developed
and was included as an appendix in the DEIS. This SMMP establishes a sequence of monitoring surveys to be undertaken
to determine any impacts resulting from disposal activities. The SMMP may be modified for cause by the responsible
agency.

6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristics of the Area Including Prevailing Current
Direction and Velocity, If Any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(6)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prevailing currents parallel the coast and are generally oriented along a north-south axis. Northerly flow predominates.
Mean surface currents range from 62 to 95 cm/sec with maximum velocities of about 150 cm/sec. Current speeds are lower
and current reversals more common in near-bottom waters. Mean velocities of 3.5 cm/sec and maximum velocities of
27 cm/sec have been reported for near-bottom waters in the area. A pycnocline occurs in site waters throughout the
year at reported depths ranging from about 60 feet in the summer to 325 feet in the winter. A dredged material dispersion
study conducted by the COE for both the short- and long-term fate of material disposed at the proposed site indicates
little possibility of disposed material affecting near-shore reefs. Measures as discussed in the Management and
Monitoring Plan will be instituted during disposal operations to minimize the possibility of material being transported
to the near-shore reefs.

[40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed ODMDS was used for the first time in April 1990. Only 225,000 cubic yards of maintenance material was disposed
in the proposed ODMDS. In conjunction with this use of the site, the Corps of Engineers in cooperation with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitored the physical processes and the dispersive characteristics
of the dredged material plume. Monitoring results indicated that the material discharged, except for a low concentration
residual remaining within the water column, reached bottom within the designated site boundaries. During the monitoring,
the resulting plumes were observed to be transported in a north to northeast direction. The full monitoring report
will be included as part of the Final EIS. Due to the limited quantity of material disposed at the site, an effects study
has not been initiated. Effects monitoring is discussed in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the EIS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No other discharges or dumping occurs in the site. The Miami-Dade Central publicly owned treatment plant outfall
discharges approximately 1.2 miles west of the site. The effects from this discharge are local and predominantly
in a north-south direction due to prevailing currents and should not have any effect within the site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While shipping is heavy at the Port of Miami, the infrequent use of this site should not significantly disrupt either
commercial shipping or recreational boating. Commercial and recreational fishing activities are concentrated
in inshore and nearshore waters. No mineral extraction, desalination, or mariculture activities occur in the immediate
area. Scientific resources present throughout this area are not geographically limited to the proposed Miami ODMDS
or nearby waters.

9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined By Available Data or By Trend Assessment or Baseline
Surveys [40 CFR 228.6(a)(9)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Water quality at the proposed ODMDS is variable and is influenced by discharges from inshore systems, frequent oceanic
intrusions, and periodic upwelling. The proposed disposal site lies on the continental slope in an area traversed
by the western edge of the Florida Current. The location of the western edge of the current determines to a large extent
whether waters at the site are predominantly coastal or oceanic. Frequent intrusions or eddies of the Florida Current
transport oceanic waters over the continental shelf in the proposed ODMDS vicinity. Periodic upwelling/downwelling
events associated with wind stress also influence waters in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No critical habitat or unique ecological communities have been identified at the candidate site. Buffer zone protection
has been applied to any existing fish havens, artificial reef communities, turtle nesting areas, and onshore amenities
in the general region of the site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disposal of dredged materials should not attract or promote the development of nuisance species. No nuisance

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

E. Site Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Site management of the Miami ODMDS is the responsibility of EPA as well as the COE. The COE issues permits to private
applicants for ocean disposal; however, EPA/Region IV assumes overall responsibility for site management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the proposed Miami ODMDS was developed as a part of the process of
completing the EIS. This plan provides procedures for both site management and for the monitoring of effects of disposal
activities. This SMMP is intended to be flexible and may be modified by the responsible agency for cause.

F. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS concludes that the proposed site may appropriately be designated for use. The proposed site is compatible
with the 11 specific and 5 general criteria used for site evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designation of the Miami site as an EPA-approved ODMDS is being published as Proposed Rulemaking. Overall management
of this site is the responsibility of the Regional Administrator of EPA/Region IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be emphasized that, if an ODMDS is designated, such a site designation does not constitute EPA's approval
of actual disposal of material at sea. Before ocean disposal of dredged material at the site may commence, the COE must
evaluate a permit application according to EPA's Ocean Dumping Criteria. EPA has the right to disapprove the actual
disposal if it determines that environmental concerns under MPRSA have not been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Miami ODMDS is not restricted to disposal use by federal projects; private applicants may also dispose suitable
dredged material at the ODMDS once relevant regulations have been satisfied. This site is restricted, however, to
suitable dredged material from the greater Miami, Florida vicinity.

G. Regulatory Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that this proposed
action will not have a significant impact on small entities since the designation will only have the effect of providing
a disposal option for dredged material. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the
requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more or cause any of the other effects which would result in its being classified by the Executive Order as
a ``significant'' rule. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Utah has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank program under Subtitle I of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the Utah application
and has made the tentative decision that Utah's underground storage tank (UST) program satisfies all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final approval. Notably, the State of Utah's statute authorizes the issuance of regulations
that are broader in scope than the Federal regulations. EPA intends to grant final approval to the State to operate
its program in lieu of the Federal program. The State of Utah's application for final approval is available for public
review and comment.

Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state underground storage
tank programs to operate in the State in lieu of the Federal underground storage tank (UST) program. Program approval
is granted by EPA if the Agency finds that the State program: (1) is ``no less stringent'' than the Federal program in
all seven elements, and includes notification requirements of section 9004(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2)
provides for adequate enforcement of compliance with UST standards (Section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)).

B. State of Utah 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1986, the State of Utah established authority through the Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Act to implement
an underground storage tank program, the State further developed its authority in the UST Act in February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989. The State adopted the federal rules and developed some additional rules in February 1989. The State submitted
a draft application for state program approval in September 1992. EPA reviewed and commented on the draft application
and requested additional information to be included in the final application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 20, 1993, Utah submitted an official application for final approval. Prior to its submission, Utah provided
an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage tank program as required
under &sect;281.50(b). EPA has reviewed Utah's application, and has tentatively determined that the State's program
meets all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final approval
to Utah to operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative determination to approve the Utah UST program applies to all activities in Utah outside of Indian Country,
as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all underground storage tank authority
under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in Utah.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before EPA would be able to approve the State of Utah UST program for any portion of ``Indian Country,'' the State would
have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order for a state
to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it has authority pursuant to applicable
principles of Federal Indian Law to enforce its laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any
geographical area for which it seeks program approval. EPA is not satisfied that Utah has, at this time, made the requisite
showing of its authority with respect to such lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In withholding program approval for these areas, EPA is not making a determination that the State either has adequate
jurisdiction or lacks such jurisdiction. Should the State of Utah choose to submit analysis with regard to its jurisdiction
over all or part of ``Indian Country'' in the State, it may do so without prejudice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's future evaluation of whether to approve the Utah program for ``Indian Country,'' to include Indian reservation
lands, will be governed by EPA's judgment as to whether the State has demonstrated adequate authority to justify such
approval, based upon its understanding of the relevant principles of Federal Indian law and sound administrative
practice. The State may wish to consider EPA's discussion of the related issue of tribal jurisdiction found in the
preamble to the Indian Water Quality Standards Regulation (see 56 FR 64876, December 12, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 9004 of RCRA 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR 281.50(e), the Agency will accept written comments
on EPA's tentative determination until November 28, 1994. Copies of Utah's application are available for inspection
and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period.
Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a decision to deny final approval to Utah. EPA expects to make a final
decision on whether or not to approve Utah's program by January 25, 1995 and will give notice of it in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of Utah's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators
of underground storage tanks in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 30, 1994, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Act) was amended to allow the issuance of permits to import sport-hunted
trophies of polar bears (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Ursus maritimus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) (excluding internal organs) legally taken by the applicant while hunting in Canada, provided certain findings
have been made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). These permits may also authorize the importation of
polar bears taken, but not imported, prior to enactment of the Amendments, provided certain conditions are met. The
Service has received a number of inquiries concerning the importation of polar bear trophies. This notice provides
information on the steps the Service is taking to implement this new provision of the Act and the anticipated timeframes.
The Service is working concurrently on developing permit regulations and gathering data to make the legal and scientific
findings required under section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear
trophies will not be accepted until the completion of the permit rulemaking process early in 1995. The Service will
be able to act on applications once it has resolved several outstanding questions and is able to make the required scientific
findings, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), and after notice and opportunity for public comment.
In the meantime, a list of interested parties has been established to receive all relevant information as the process
proceeds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to enactment of amendments to the Act in 1994, those seeking authority to import polar bear trophies from Canada
were required to obtain a waiver of the Act's moratorium on taking and importing marine mammals. The 1994 Amendments
included a streamlined procedure for authorizing such imports by permit. Section 104(c)(5) of the Act sets out a permitting
process, as well as the specific findings that must be made before permits can be issued to import these trophies into
the United States. The Service is developing proposed regulations that will outline the permit application requirements,
procedures, issuance criteria, and fee. The law requires the Service to establish and charge a reasonable fee for
issuing polar bear trophy import permits. As specified in the Amendments, all fees would be used for polar bear conservation
programs being conducted in Alaska and Russia. The Service anticipates publishing a proposed rule promptly so, after
a review of all available data and public comments, a decision can be published as early as possible in calendar year
1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is unable to accept applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear trophies until the permit rulemaking
process is complete in early 1995. Once the Service has received comments on the application requirements under the
proposed rule, an application form will be developed and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval
under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time that the permit rulemaking process is occurring, the Service is working with the Canadian wildlife
authorities to obtain information necessary to make the findings required by section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Prior
to issuing a permit, the Service must find that (1) the applicant has provided the necessary documentation to show
that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant; (2) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport-hunting
program consistent with the purposes of the 1971 International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears; (3)
Canada's sport-hunting program is based on scientifically sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the affected
population stock at a sustainable level; (4) the export and subsequent import are consistent with the provisions
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and other international agreements and conventions;
and (5) the export and subsequent import are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is to make these findings after notice and opportunity for public comment and in consultation with the
MMC, an independent Federal agency with statutory authority to make recommendations pursuant to Title II of the Act.
Several questions have come to the attention of the Service. A contract report prepared for the MMC in 1993 has questioned
whether Canada's sport-hunting program is fully consistent with Article III of the Agreement. In addition, the Amendments
require the Service to make the determination of sustainability of hunting quotas at the population level, but Canada
manages polar bears at the subpopulation level. The Service is currently pursuing the resolution of these and related
questions concerning its ability to make the required findings. Once these questions have been resolved and the Service
is able to make the findings outlined above, it will be able to act on applications. The Service seeks information regarding
each of these five findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While conducting these activities, the Service will need to evaluate its actions under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By April 30, 1996, the Service is to undertake a scientific review of the impact of permits issued on the Canadian polar
bear population stocks. An opportunity for public comment will be part of this review, with the responses included
in the final report. Permit issuance can continue after September 30, 1996, only if the Service determines, based
on scientific review, that the issuance of permits is not having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear populations
stocks in Canada.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting regulations
for human drug products and for licensed biological products to provide consistency with the elements of FDA Form
3500A and require the use of this new reporting form; revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats
as recommended by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the World Health Organization's Council for International Organizations
of Medical Sciences (CIOMS); require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written
procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences; state that reports of adverse experiences that are
forwarded by FDA to the applicant or manufacturer, packer, and distributor should not be resubmitted to the agency;
and make other revisions to the regulations to provide uniformity in adverse experience reporting for human drug
products and licensed biological products. These changes would simplify and facilitate the reporting of adverse
experiences and would enhance agencywide consistency in the collection of postmarketing adverse experience data.
In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting
requirements in the investigational new drug application (IND) regulations. These amendments are intended to provide
more complete and accurate information that would enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious
toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously during clinical studies.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31596), FDA announced the availability of a new form for reporting adverse events and product
problems with medications, devices, and other FDA-regulated medical products. This form is available in two versions.
One version of the form (FDA Form 3500) is to be used by health professionals for voluntary reporting; the other version
of the form (FDA Form 3500A) is to be used by applicants or manufacturers (including licensed manufacturers of licensed
biological products), and other persons subject to mandatory reporting requirements under FDA regulations. Under
existing regulations, drug manufacturers, packers, and distributors and applicants for new drug products and generic
drug products must report adverse events under &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80 (21 CFR 310.305 and 314.80). Elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is issuing a final rule establishing new &sect;600.80. This section makes licensed manufacturers of biological
products subject to certain reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new form is part of FDA's Medical Products Reporting Program (MedWatch) and is designed to encourage and facilitate
the reporting of adverse events and product problems for most FDA-regulated human medical products by the entire
health care community, including manufacturers, distributors, user facilities, and health professionals. FDA
issued the new form to simplify and consolidate the reporting of suspected adverse events and product problems with
human drug products, biologics, and medical devices, as well as the reporting of adverse events with other FDA-regulated
medical products, such as dietary supplements. FDA has found that, under the current system, there is some confusion
about what to report to the agency and that the existing assortment of reporting forms and systems can interfere with
the efficient reporting of suspected problems. FDA has attempted to clarify and simplify adverse event reporting
with the new form by eliminating redundant or nonessential elements and by clarifying those areas that have caused
confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA Form 3500A replaces current Form FDA&hyph;1639, as well as most other adverse event and product problem reporting
forms currently required by the agency. Adverse events associated with vaccines will continue to be reported through
the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). FDA is proposing
to amend the adverse experience reporting requirements for human drug products and for licensed biological products
to be consistent with the elements of FDA Form 3500A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing FDA Forms 3500 and 3500A, the agency considered several recommendations from ICH and CIOMS. These organizations
were formed to facilitate international consideration of issues, particularly safety issues, concerning the use
of both foreign and domestic data in the development and use of drugs and biological products. ICH has worked to promote
the harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions:
The European Union, Japan, and the United States. ICH has prepared a draft guideline specific to parts of this issue
entitled: ``Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting.'' In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 9, 1993 (58 FR 37408), FDA published this draft guideline for public comment. Several CIOMS working groups
have worked to coordinate and standardize the international reporting of postmarketing adverse drug reactions
by pharmaceutical manufacturers to regulatory authorities. CIOMS Working Group II has proposed an international
system of standardized time intervals, formats, and inclusion criteria in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation
time among manufacturers and to enable them to report postmarketing adverse experiences more rapidly, efficiently,
and effectively (Refs. 1 and 2). FDA believes that many changes recommended by CIOMS and ICH would result in more effective
reporting of serious adverse experiences to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA is proposing to amend the adverse
experience reporting requirements for human drug products and licensed biological products in part to be consistent
with certain standardized definitions, procedures, and formats proposed by these international organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting requirements
in the IND regulations. These amendments are intended to provide more complete and accurate information that would
enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously
during clinical studies. A clinical study of fialuridine (FIAU) resulted in several instances of severe liver and
pancreatic injury and five deaths, beginning in June 1993. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force to
see whether the data available before the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged, and whether
some differences in process or behavior by investigators and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely for
them to have anticipated the toxicity in the 1993 study. The proposed IND amendments contained in this document are
largely the result of recommendations by this task force.

II. Description of the Proposed Rule

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Replacement of Form FDA&hyph;1639 and How to Obtain Copies of FDA Form 3500A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's existing regulations at 21 CFR 20.112, 310.305, and 314.80 refer to Form FDA&hyph;1639. The agency is proposing
to amend these regulations to replace references to Form FDA&hyph;1639 with new FDA Form 3500A. This change is necessary
because new FDA Form 3500A replaces Form FDA&hyph;1639 (58 FR 31596).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations at &sect;&sect;310.305(d)(4) and 314.80(f)(4)) also provide an address where a person
may obtain copies of Form FDA&hyph;1639. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations to state where a person can obtain
copies of FDA Form 3500A. Ten or fewer copies of FDA Form 3500A and a copy of the instructions for completing the form
can be obtained from the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD&hyph;730), Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Large numbers of copies (greater
than 10 copies) may be obtained by writing to the Consolidated Forms and Publications Distribution Center, Washington
Commerce Center, 3222 Hubbard Rd., Landover, MD 20785.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Definitions of ``Data Lock-Point'' and ``International Birth Date'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.80(a) and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``data lock-point'' and ``international
birth date.'' The ``data lock-point'' is the end of the reporting period (cutoff date) for data to be incorporated
into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic report. On this date, the data available to the reporter
are held for review and evaluation by the applicant or licensed manufacturer prior to being submitted to FDA. The international
birth date is the date that the first regulatory authority in the world approved the human drug or biological product
for marketing. As explained further in section II.E. of this document, each 6-month anniversary of the international
birth date is the data lock-point for data to be incorporated into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic
report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would define these terms because they describe the standardized international reporting period
developed by CIOMS for submitting postmarketing adverse experience reports. CIOMS developed this standardized
reporting period to lessen confusion and to enable applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare and submit similar
reports of adverse experiences to regulatory authorities. It would also reduce preparation time among applicants
and licensed manufacturers because it eliminates varying due dates presently required for submitting postmarketing
adverse experience reports to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which
decreases reporting rates currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years
of marketing from every 3 months to every 6 months and increases it thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months,
permits adequate time for reporters to make periodic submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, the agency
believes that the proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to notify FDA of potential postmarketing safety problems
that do not require expedited reporting.

FDA's existing adverse experience reporting regulations (21 CFR 310.305(b)(4), 312.32(a), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a))
define a serious adverse experience as one that is ``fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, requires
inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose.'' Consistent with new FDA Form 3500A
and with recommendations by the ICH and CIOMS, the proposed rule would amend this definition to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to remove ``cancer'' from the definition because cancer would most often be reported under
the other broader elements in the definition. For example, cancer may be reported as life-threatening or requiring
inpatient hospitalization. Other diseases or conditions that may be life-threatening or require hospitalization,
such as heart disease or myocardial infarction, have not been identified as separate elements in previous definitions,
and the agency believes it is not necessary to single out cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would also remove ``overdose'' from the definition of serious. Reports of overdoses that
had serious outcomes would still be reported under the other broader elements in the definition. Reports of overdoses
that did not lead to outcomes defined as serious would provide the agency with less critical safety information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By adding the phrase ``occurring at any dose'' after ``adverse drug experience'' in the definition, the agency will
ensure that a serious adverse experience at any dose, whether it is the labeled dose or a different dose, including
an overdose or an underdose, should be reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to clarify the phrase ``is permanently disabling'' by substituting ``results in persistent
or significant disability/incapacity.'' This change is intended to clarify that a disability need not be permanent
to be considered a serious adverse experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would also modify the phrase ``requires inpatient hospitalization'' to read ``requires
or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.'' This change is intended to cover those situations where a serious adverse
experience occurs while the patient is already hospitalized, and the adverse experience prolongs the patient's
hospital stay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to add the phrase ``necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.'' The agency believes such events should be considered
serious adverse experiences and should be reported. This change is also consistent with ICH's proposed definition
of a serious adverse event. FDA notes that a serious adverse experience would not include the discontinuation of therapy,
changes in dosage, or routine treatment with a prescription medication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Definitions of ``Disability'' and ``Life-Threatening''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend &sect;&sect;310.305(b), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``disability''
and ``life-threatening.'' These terms further explain what constitutes a serious adverse experience. ``Disability''
means a substantial disruption of one's ability to carry out normal life functions. ``Life-threatening'' means
that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as
it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal. FDA believes these definitions will help enable reporters to determine when a serious
adverse experience occurs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Periodic Adverse Experience Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations (&sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i)) require the submission of periodic postmarketing
reports at quarterly intervals for 3 years from the date of approval of the application, and then annually. Quarterly
reports must be submitted within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first quarter beginning on the date of U.S.
approval of the application); each annual report must be submitted within 60 days of the date of U.S. approval of the
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to revise this schedule by requiring the submission of periodic postmarketing adverse reaction
reports every 6 months. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. The proposed rule would require periodic reports to be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point.
For example, a product approved by FDA, or licensed, if a biological product, on June 15, with an international birth
date of April 1, would have its first data lock-point on October 1, which is less than 6 months after FDA approval, but
which is the 6-month anniversary of the international birth date. Therefore, the first periodic report would be for
the period of June 15 to October 1 and would be due at FDA by November 14. The second periodic report would cover October
2 to April 1 and would be due to the agency no later than May 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would create the same reporting schedule based on the international birth date and data lock-point
for licensed biological product distribution reports under &sect;600.80(c)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This new reporting schedule is consistent with the standardized international reporting period proposed by the
CIOMS II Working Group. This working group has recommended that all international regulatory authorities accept
the same reporting schedule in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation time by manufacturers, rather than
the current system of varying due dates. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which decreases reporting rates
currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years of marketing from every 3
months to every 6 months and increases reporting rates thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months, permits adequate
time for reporters to make nonexpedited submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, FDA believes that the
proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to alert the agency to potential postmarketing safety problems that
are not within the categories requiring 15-day ``Alert reports.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants and licensed manufacturers who wish to submit periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports at
different intervals could, under proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i), submit a request
for a waiver under 21 CFR 314.90 or 600.90 to alter the reporting intervals for these periodic reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i) would also amend the reporting requirements for periodic
postmarketing adverse experience reports to state that, in cases where the applicant or licensed manufacturer has
received no reports of adverse experiences during a reporting period, the applicant or licensed manufacturer should
submit a copy of the current approved labeling and a letter to the agency in place of a periodic postmarketing adverse
experience report. The letter should identify the product, the application number, and the reporting period, and
state that no adverse experience reports were received during that reporting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 314.80(c)(2)(ii) and 600.80(c)(2)(ii) set forth the contents currently required for a periodic report:
(1) A narrative summary and analysis of the information in the report and an analysis of the 15-day postmarketing Alert
reports submitted during the reporting interval; (2) a report describing each adverse experience not previously
reported; and (3) a history of actions taken since the last periodic report. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations
to provide a more extensive list of contents for a periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Title Page, Table of Contents, and Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would provide a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicant's Core Safety Data Sheet
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant's core safety data sheet would be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in &sect;&sect;314.80(a)
or 600.80(a) would apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is expected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it must clearly be stated in this section of the report. In all instances, if an adverse event is not listed
in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall
safety evaluation'' (see section II.E.8. of this document).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section would also highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's core safety
data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Product's Marketing Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would contain, in tabular form, a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory and marketing decisions affecting the product) from the date it was first approved through its current
status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons would have to be included. The product
would be listed by chemical (U.S. Adopted Names, international nonproprietary names, or proper name in accordance
with ``Chemical Abstracts Nomenclature Standards'') and brand name(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Regulatory Actions for Safety Reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would identify in narrative form the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
would include, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Patient Exposure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This information would be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer
to estimate patient exposure would always be described and would include the total number of dosage units of each dosage
form and strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Individual Case Histories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These reports would be presented in line listing format with the following 10 columns: country, source, age, gender,
dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. The individual
case reports would consist of adverse drug experiences that are: (a) Serious, unexpected reports from published
or unpublished clinical studies where it has been concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug or
licensed biological product caused the adverse experience; (b) serious, expected or unexpected spontaneous adverse
drug experience reports and nonserious, unexpected spontaneous adverse experience reports received directly
by the applicant or licensed manufacturer from the initial reporter or received by the applicant or licensed manufacturer
from a drug regulatory authority, both U.S. or foreign; and (c) serious, expected or unexpected individual published
case histories and nonserious, unexpected individual published case histories. This section would end with an analysis
by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The applicant or licensed manufacturer would also attach
to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A for all U.S. spontaneous reports of adverse
experiences except those not to be included in the periodic report as specified in proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii), or those sent by FDA to the applicant or licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Safety Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would analyze and discuss fully and critically all toxicological, clinical, and epidemiological studies
containing important safety information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Overall Safety Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would provide critical analysis of the safety information provided in the periodic report as it pertains
to serious unexpected reactions, increased frequencies of known toxicity, reactions listed in the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet but not included in the U.S. label, drug or licensed biological product interactions, overdose,
drug or licensed biological product abuse, experiences during pregnancy or lactation, chronic treatment, pediatric
or geriatric treatment, and new safety issues. For each of these areas, any absence of significant information would
be reported. The evaluation would indicate whether the safety profile of the product remains consistent with cumulative
experience to date and with the previous manufacturer's core safety data sheet. The evaluation would specify any
action recommended and the reasons for such recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Other Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would consist of important information received after the data lock-point. It may include significant
new cases or followup data that affect the interpretation or evaluation of existing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. FDA Form 3500A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would consist of a completed FDA Form 3500A for each spontaneous U.S. adverse drug experience not reported
under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) in &sect;&sect;314.80 and 600.80. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Location of Adverse Experience Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would identify the current address(es), including street, city, State, and zip code, where all adverse
experience reports and records are maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports is generally consistent with
the international system of standardized postmarketing periodic reporting procedures and formats proposed by
the CIOMS II Working Group. This standardization would allow applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare a
single postmarketing periodic report of adverse experiences for regulatory authorities worldwide. The agency
also believes that the proposed rule would improve reporting and would enhance FDA's ability to monitor potential
postmarketing safety problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this proposed revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports, FDA
is proposing to remove &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These sections state that periodic
reporting does not apply to information obtained from postmarketing studies, reports in the scientific literature,
and foreign marketing experience. The proposed revised list of contents would include such information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. IND Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA regulations governing the use of investigational drugs in clinical investigations are contained in part 312
(21 CFR part 312). In order to conduct a clinical investigation using an investigational drug, a sponsor must first
submit an IND, described in &sect;312.23, which contains, among other things, a description of the drug, the results
of preclinical studies intended to show that the drug can be introduced into humans with reasonable safety, and a proposed
protocol for the investigation. This protocol provides a description of all aspects of the study, including the identity
and qualifications of the investigators conducting the study, procedures and criteria for selecting subjects,
the amount of the drug to be administered, the duration of use, the observations to be made to assess the effects of the
drug, and the clinical procedures, laboratory tests, and other measures carried out to minimize risk to the patient.
After the IND becomes effective and the investigational drug is being administered to human subjects, the sponsor
is required under &sect;312.32 to make both telephone and written safety reports on serious and unexpected adverse
experiences associated with the administration of the drug, as well as written reports only, on other serious adverse
events associated with administration of the drug. Under current &sect;312.33, the sponsor is also required to submit
an annual report containing significant safety and other information. If FDA concludes that a study would place subjects
at unreasonable and significant risk, FDA may place a study on clinical hold. This means that the drug may not be administered
to subjects until the hold is lifted (see &sect;312.42). FDA may also terminate the study under &sect;312.44 based
on such safety concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is concerned that these IND reporting requirements may not be adequate to protect against some unexpected adverse
events. For example, there is a potential for such events to be disguised by patient conditions that might lead the
investigator to conclude that the experimental drug was not implicated in those events. The agency believes that
certain modifications in the way clinical investigations are conducted and reported may help to ensure that drug
toxicity is detected as early as possible. A recent internal task force that examined an incident that involved a fatal
drug toxicity that was not detected in early trials has recommended improvements in IND reporting that the agency
is incorporating into this proposal for public consideration. These improvements, as explained below, are intended
to provide more frequent and more complete evaluations of potentially serious adverse effects so that drug-related
events can be detected earlier by sponsors, investigators, and FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A clinical study of a nucleoside analog, FIAU, resulted in several instances of severe liver injury and five deaths,
beginning in June 1993. The study involved 15 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. FIAU had been considered
a highly promising agent without recognized serious toxicity. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force
to see whether the data available prior to the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged. The task
force examined data from the 1993 FIAU study as well as data from previous studies on FIAU and a closely related drug
conducted by another sponsor. The data from these previous studies was, or should have been, available to the sponsor
of the 1993 FIAU study. The task force was also to determine whether some differences in process or behavior by investigators
and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely to have anticipated the toxicity. The proposed IND amendments
contained in this document are largely the result of recommendations by the task force (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Focusing on hepatic and pancreatic adverse events, the task force reviewed the data and data analyses that were available
to investigators, sponsors, and FDA at the start of the study to determine whether improvements in the rules governing
design, analysis, and reporting of data from clinical studies were warranted. The task force found a number of observations
and events that suggested an association between FIAU and hepatic and/or pancreatic abnormalities. However, none
of these events was attributed by the sponsors or investigators to FIAU. Rather, each event, even when recognized
as temporally related to a study, was attributed by investigators and sponsors to other factors, such as concomitant
drug administration and/or concurrent illness. The task force found that an overview of the data, in which deaths
and serious adverse experiences were analyzed cumulatively, and, with the hypothesis that the events were drug related,
was not produced and thus was not available for use by the sponsors, the principal investigators, or FDA reviewers.
Rather, the analyses performed focused on each individual event and determined a plausible explanation, other than
drug toxicity, for each occurrence. The task force recommended that, to detect similar patterns of events reflecting
toxicity in future studies, sponsors should conduct cumulative analyses with a systematic consideration of the
possibility that the adverse events are caused by the investigational drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed IND amendments would apply to all investigational studies conducted under part 312. However, FDA invites
comments from the public and industry on whether any or all of the proposed requirements should apply only to certain
IND's, whose selection could be determined by application of criteria that could be included in these regulations,
or only to certain phases of drug testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Clinical Study Design
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the requirements governing IND format and content in &sect;312.23. Under current &sect;312.23(a)(6),
an IND must contain the protocols for each planned study, including information such as a statement of the study's
objectives and purpose, the criteria for patient selection and exclusion, a description of the study design, the
method for determining the dose(s) to be administered and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug,
and a description of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other measures to be taken to monitor the effects of
the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several instances, FDA's FIAU task force found that deaths and serious hepatic and pancreatic injuries that appear
in retrospect to have been related to FIAU were attributed by investigators and sponsors to the subjects' underlying
disease or to other drugs the subjects were taking for their conditions. The task force made several recommendations
intended to improve the likelihood that clinical studies will identify, early in drug development, drug toxicity
that mimics the underlying disease or the toxicity of concomitant medications. These recommendations include:
(1) Choosing study designs and safety endpoints that increase a study's ability to distinguish drug toxicity from
underlying disease or other drug toxicity; (2) prospectively identifying observations that will trigger certain
actions by investigators; and (3) summarizing safety data at regular intervals with systematic considerations
of the possibility that adverse events are drug related. The proposed rule would create new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
to require that the protocols describe any adverse clinical or laboratory outcomes in the study that are to be immediately
reported to the sponsor. These reportable events might include death, any life-threatening event, or any other serious
event that might reflect potential drug toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, and include abnormal laboratory
results falling outside of a specified range. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications. Under the proposal, these events would be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or concomitant medications. Proposed &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
would also require instructions for investigators, such as reporting requirements, remeasurement or challenge
procedures, or discontinuation of the drug in response to identified events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force also recommended that sponsors consider the use of a control group (for example, placebo, active control,
or historical control) in studies that focus on safety when the underlying disease process is likely to produce adverse
events that might be confused with drug toxicity. The task force concluded that such controls would help detect some
adverse events. Consequently, proposed &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) states that sponsors should consider the use of a formal control group when the underlying disease is likely to produce
adverse events that might be confused with drug toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force also recommended that sponsors attempt to estimate the expected incidence of death and serious adverse
events in the study population that arise from the underlying disease or concomitant medications used to treat the
disease. This recommendation is reflected in proposed new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
j
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that would require sponsors to provide such estimates. Under the proposal, any deaths or adverse events that exceed
the estimates would create the presumption that the events are associated with use of the investigational drug, and
the sponsor would be required to submit a written safety report to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force found that the followup periods in some of the FIAU and related studies were too short to detect some of
the adverse events that occurred because significant adverse events sometimes occurred weeks to months after dosing
with FIAU ended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force recommended that all protocols contained in the IND include an explicit description of the length and
type of followup to be performed so that the agency may review the followup procedures (task force report at 57). Accordingly,
FDA is proposing to add new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k) to require that the protocol section of an IND specify and
justify the length and type of followup for subjects after the conclusion of dosing. The justification may be brief;
for example, a reference to a study of a similar drug with the same followup period. The followup period would ensure
that clinical studies are adequately designed to detect drug toxicity that occurs after the conclusion of drug dosing.
The sponsor would propose an appropriate followup period based on preclinical data, experience with other members
of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action, and prior human experience. The intensity of the followup may change
with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled for 2 weeks postdosing, with a telephone followup for possible
serious events at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies, telephone followup should occur at 3 months after
the dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. For some drugs,
like FIAU, a review of available data may suggest that the minimum followup period should be longer than 3 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations in &sect;312.56 require sponsors to review and evaluate the evidence relating to a drug's safety
and effectiveness as it is obtained from investigators. The regulations also require sponsors to report safety information
to FDA. The task force observed that in the FIAU study sponsors may not have had available adequate resources to evaluate
safety data reported by investigators. The proposed rule would amend &sect;312.56(c) to require sponsors, in addition
to reviewing and evaluating safety and effectiveness information, to develop a safety monitoring and evaluation
program before starting clinical trials. This provision is intended to ensure that sponsors have or will develop
adequate resources to evaluate safety data reported by investigators and is consistent with the task force's recommendations
(see task force report at 57). Consistent with this proposed requirement, FDA is also proposing in new &sect;312.23(a)(3)(v)
that an IND contain a description of any safety monitoring and evaluation program. This description would be in addition
to the introductory statement and general investigational plan that are required under current regulations.

2. Safety Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing several amendments to the requirements for IND safety reports in &sect;312.32. FDA is proposing
to alter the period for submitting written safety reports, under &sect;312.32(c)(1)(i) and (d)(3), from 10 working
days to 15 calendar days, and for submitting safety reports by telephone, under &sect;312.32(c)(2), from 3 working
days to 7 calendar days. FDA is also proposing to allow telephone safety reports to be made by facsimile transmission
as well as orally by telephone. These changes will give sponsors additional time to gather appropriate data to help
interpret the reports before submitting these reports. FDA believes the extended time period would be sufficient
to alert the agency to potential safety problems, especially because of the new investigational reporting requirements
the agency is proposing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;312.32(c) would also permit sponsors to submit IND safety reports to the agency by using FDA Form 3500A.
If FDA determined that insufficient data were submitted on FDA Form 3500A, the agency could require additional narrative
data to be submitted. As explained elsewhere in this proposal, this amendment is consistent with the proposal to use
this form for postmarketing reporting of human drug and licensed biological product adverse experiences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend the disclaimer contained in &sect;312.32(e) to emphasize that safety information
submitted to FDA are not to be considered admissions of causation or liability. The proposal would substitute the
word ``part'' for ``section'' so that the revised disclaimer would clearly apply to all safety information submitted
under part 312. Summaries of such safety information would not constitute a statement or admission that there was
a causal link between the administration of the drug and the subsequent adverse event.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Semiannual Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the periodic reporting requirements in &sect;312.33 by adding, in addition to the annual
report, a semiannual death and serious adverse experiences report. This change is intended to ensure that reports
of deaths and other serious adverse experiences in all clinical studies are collected and reviewed in a timely and
comprehensive manner, and that the possibility of drug relatedness is always considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current regulations, sponsors must report deaths and serious and unexpected adverse experiences within 3
or 10 working days only if the events are associated with the use of the drug. ``Associated with the use of the drug''
is defined to mean that there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by the drug (see &sect;312.32(a)).
Deaths and a summary of serious adverse experiences that occur in a clinical trial that the sponsor concludes are not
associated with use of the drug must be reported only in an IND annual report. The task force found that many adverse
experiences occurring during the FIAU study that appear, in retrospect, to have been drug related were not reported
in safety reports, although, at times, they were reported in the annual report as attributable to causes other than
FIAU. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, therefore, would create a new ``semiannual report'' to require, among other things, the submission
of reports of all deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations resulting from an adverse experience,
whether expected or unexpected and whether or not there was thought to be a possibility that the death or adverse experience
was caused by the drug. In these twice yearly reports, sponsors would also report all deaths and serious adverse experiences
that occurred during the trial or within the prescribed followup period. The report would include data not only from
studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide, with
an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be related
to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous or required
reporting systems. Serious adverse events should include laboratory changes that result in discontinuation or
that are identified in the study protocol as reportable events. Sponsors would present these data both for the 6-month
reporting interval and cumulatively, and submit an analysis of the data. The agency would expect the analysis to conform
generally to the evaluation of deaths, serious adverse experiences, and discontinuations in the section entitled
``Integrated Summary of Safety Information'' in FDA's ``Guideline for the Format and Content of the Clinical and
Statistical Sections of New Drug Applications.'' FDA also recommends that the sponsor employ, in preparing the analysis,
at least one individual who had no involvement in conducting the clinical study. The proposal would also require a
sponsor to conduct a ``worst-case'' analysis of the safety data, presuming that observed adverse events were the
result of toxicity from the investigational drug, and then attempt to refute this presumption, with appropriate
data and evaluations (task force report at 59). The analysis should include estimates of the rate of an analyzed event
occurring spontaneously in the population and specific analyses of cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sponsor would submit the semiannual report for the 6-month period following the day the IND goes into effect, and
for each 6-month period thereafter, until the end of the followup period specified in the protocol. The report would
be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual safety report that is due during the same period
as the annual report would be submitted with the annual report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force recommended (task force report at 59) that FDA require the submission of all available autopsy reports
and medical reports concerning all deaths reported in these semiannual reports, because, in at least one instance
during the FIAU study, the cause of death originally reported was not fully consistent with the autopsy and terminal
medical reports later obtained for that subject. Proposed &sect;312.33(b)(2) would require the submission of these
reports and would require the sponsor to clarify any inconsistencies between these reports and the cause of death
reported to FDA by the sponsor. FDA is proposing this requirement to help ensure that reports covering deaths submitted
to the agency are complete and accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;312.33(b)(3), at the request of the sponsor, or on its own initiative, FDA may modify certain
semiannual reporting requirements where, for example, the clinical study endpoint is mortality or where the study
is blinded and full compliance with the reporting requirement would require breaking the blind. FDA is proposing
this provision because studies vary concerning the nature and seriousness of the disease to be treated, the number
of subjects exposed to the drug, and the general pace at which the drug's development proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Special Safety Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In new &sect;312.37(a), FDA also proposes an additional mechanism to allow the agency to obtain safety data on investigational
drugs and summaries of these data not otherwise obtained through other reporting requirements if, and when, these
data are necessary. Most investigational drugs do not present unusual safety concerns, so that the safety data contained
in the 6-month and annual reports, as well as the IND safety reports submitted under &sect;312.32, would provide adequate
information to allow FDA to observe drug safety. Some drugs, however, may raise significant safety concerns either
anticipated or unanticipated, so that more comprehensive data on events that do not meet the definition of a serious
adverse reaction as well as those that do are needed. Events that might trigger this heightened scrutiny include agency
experience with similar drugs, animal toxicity study results, and information derived from IND safety, annual,
or semiannual reports. As recommended by the task force (task force report at 59 and 60), the proposed regulation is
drafted in general language to allow the agency, in consultation with the sponsor, flexibility in determining when
a report should be required and what information it should contain. This flexibility is considered necessary because
the specifics of the safety summary may vary from study to study. FDA anticipates that the safety summary will generally
not only contain the results of the cumulative analysis of deaths and serious adverse experiences contained in the
6-month report, but also an analysis of related events of lesser seriousness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the task force recommended that FDA require safety summaries unless an exemption had been granted to the
sponsor, FDA is proposing to require safety summaries only for those studies or products where the agency has determined
that a specific need for them exists. FDA would generally expect safety summaries to be submitted within 30 days after
they are requested; however, the agency recognizes that in cases where large amounts of data are required to be summarized
and those data are not readily available or easily summarized, a longer period of time may be necessary to prepare the
summary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Final Clinical Study Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information about FIAU risks and benefits that the sponsor might have derived from the process of collecting and analyzing
study results was delayed or never developed because final reports were not required for the earlier clinical studies
of FIAU and FIAC (a closely related nucleoside analog). Thus, FDA is proposing in &sect;312.37(b) to require sponsors
to submit, when required by FDA, a final report or study summary of a clinical study. FDA anticipates that final reports
usually will not be necessary. Instituting requirements for semiannual reporting of deaths, serious adverse experiences,
and discontinuations, and for summarization of all safety data will largely fulfill the need for more careful monitoring
and analysis of potential drug toxicity during drug testing. In some cases, however, it may still be valuable to have
available an analysis of the results of particular trials; e.g., to provide data on the likely effectiveness of a drug
for purposes of weighing risks against likely benefits to study subjects. The proposal would
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require final clinical study reports to be submitted within 90 days of a request from FDA, but provides for exceptions
under extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Clinical Holds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 312.42 currently allows FDA to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation
under certain circumstances. Under the proposal, FDA would amend &sect;312.42 to allow the agency to place an investigation
on clinical hold if the sponsor fails to submit a special safety summary or final clinical study report. If the same
or a closely related drug is the subject of a concurrent investigation, conducted by the same sponsor, proposed &sect;312.42(b)(1)(v)
would require safety summaries from all investigations or the agency could place any of the investigations on clinical
hold. FDA believes this is appropriate because data from all studies involving the drug or closely related drugs may
help FDA evaluate the safety of each study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Termination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing in &sect;312.44(b)(1)(viii) to amend the regulations regarding termination so that failure
to submit a semiannual report would be grounds for terminating an IND. Failure to submit an annual report is already
grounds for terminating an IND, and FDA is aware of no reason why semiannual and annual reports should be treated differently
in this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA considers that failure to implement an adequate safety monitoring and evaluation program, as described in proposed
21 CFR 312.56(c), would be grounds for either a clinical hold under &sect;312.42 or a termination of the IND under &sect;312.44,
since failure to have a program in place would mean that ``[h]uman subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable
and significant risk of illness or injury,'' which is currently grounds for either a clinical hold or termination.

8. Review of Ongoing Investigations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;312.64(b) to require investigators to submit safety data to sponsors necessary
to allow sponsors to comply with the other proposed safety reporting requirements, such as the proposed semiannual
report. The proposed amendment would require the investigator to comply with safety reporting requirements established
in the protocol for the study. Current &sect;312.64(b) requires investigators to report adverse effects if they
may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. If the adverse effects are alarming, they
are to be reported to the sponsor immediately. These provisions are being retained as minimal requirements which
must be met, even if the protocol does not require the events to be reported.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Written Procedures for Monitoring Adverse Experiences
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(a) and 314.80(b) for marketed human drug products and &sect;600.80(b)
for licensed biological products to require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop
written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. This
requirement would improve postmarketing surveillance by applicants or manufacturers and would enhance an applicant's
or manufacturer's ability to evaluate and report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse experiences to the agency. FDA believes that this provision would not impose a new burden on applicants and
manufacturers, because it codifies a practice that is already customary and usual in the pharmaceutical industry
for handling adverse experiences. Based on field inspections, FDA is aware that many manufacturers already have
written procedures for the receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. The agency also notes
that the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals, which apply to manufacturers
of all marketed human drug and biological products, require written procedures describing the handling of all written
and oral complaints regarding a drug product (21 CFR 211.198). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the agency's ``Guideline For Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences'' (Ref. 4), which
provides guidance on adverse drug experiences reported under &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80, states (at page 17)
that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each applicant should develop standardized, formal procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and
reporting of ADE's to FDA. * * * All applicants should develop procedures that allow expedited adverse experience
report handling, and the applicant should keep on file documentation of due diligence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``Guideline for Adverse Experience Reporting for Licensed
Biological Products.'' This guideline discusses the reports required by &sect;600.80 and provides guidance concerning
appropriate means of meeting the reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Resubmission of Reports Received From FDA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the MedWatch program, FDA will transmit reports of spontaneously reported serious adverse experiences received
by the agency to the applicant, manufacturer, packer, or distributor (as appropriate) on an expedited basis. Consequently,
FDA is proposing to revise &sect;&sect;310.305(c), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b) to state that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors should not resubmit to the agency reports of adverse experiences that the agency has forwarded
to them. In addition, FDA is proposing to revise &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(1)(i) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) to remove the
phrase ``regardless of source'' from the description of which adverse experiences are reported to FDA. These revisions
are intended to reduce duplicate reporting of adverse experiences to the agency, consistent with the reporting instructions
in new FDA Form 3500A. FDA notes, however, that applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors receiving
reports forwarded to them by FDA are required to handle these reports as they would any others and that followup, if
obtained, is to be sent to the agency as specified in the regulation. These followup reports should be included, where
appropriate, in the postmarketing adverse experience periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing that applicants and licensed manufacturers incorporate into any safety analysis (i.e., periodic
reports, increased frequency reports) the expedited reports received from FDA, whether or not additional followup
information was obtained, and any information received through Freedom of Information requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Other Revisions to the Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to remove &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These paragraphs state that
periodic reporting for non-15-day Alert reports does not apply to adverse drug experience information obtained
from postmarketing studies and reports in the scientific literature and from foreign marketing experience. FDA
is proposing to remove these paragraphs because this information would now be required under the proposed revisions
to the contents of a periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations, at &sect;314.80(c)(1)(ii), require applicants and, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;600,80(c)(1)ii), licensed manufacturers to ``review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting
cycle)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in frequency to FDA.
Similarly, current &sect;310.305(c)(4) requires manufacturers, packers,and distributors to ``review periodically
(at least once each year)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in
frequency to FDA. In order to provide consistency with the proposed semiannual reporting requirements for periodic
adverse experience reports under &sect;&sect;314.80 and 600.80, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;310.305 to require
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to review periodically, at least twice each year, the frequency of adverse
experience reports for the purposes of making increased frequency reports to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c) and 314.80(c) by reorganizing, renumbering, and retitling
the paragraphs in these sections to distinguish between postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports, followups to
postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports, and increased frequency reports. The proposed amendments would also
distinguish between the reporting intervals for postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports and the revised intervals
proposed for postmarketing periodic reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c)(1) through (c)(4) and 314.80(c)(1)(i), through (c)(1)(iv)
to alter the period for submitting postmarketing ``15&hyph;day'' Alert reports from 15 working days to 15 calendar
days. This change should decrease misunderstandings with the reporting requirements as all timeframes would now
be stated in terms of calendar days. In addition, this change would increase consistency between the premarketing
and postmarketing reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii) to require
applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors who have been unable to obtain additional information about
adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports to maintain records of their attempts
to seek additional information. These proposed revisions will help ensure that applicants or manufacturers are
making good faith efforts to investigate adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert
reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(d)(3)(ii) and 314.80(f)(3)(ii) to instruct applicants
or manufacturers, packers, and distributors that, before using an alternative reporting form instead of FDA Form
3500A, they must obtain approval from MedWatch: The FDA Medical Products Reporting Program, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20852&hyph;9787. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations require prior approval from the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance for human drug products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Distribution Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated earlier, the proposed rule would change the reporting interval for licensed biological product distribution
reports to be consistent with the suggested CIOMS standardized reporting period for postmarketing adverse drug
experience periodic reports. Licensed biological product distribution reports would be based on the international
birth date and data lock-point. The proposal would also remove &sect;600.81 and move the regulatory requirements
for licensed biological product distribution reports to &sect;600.80(c)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Multiple Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;600.80(g) concerning multiple reports by adding information pertaining to a licensed
biological product for which a licensed manufacturer holds more than one biological product license. This revision
would be consistent with the requirements in &sect;314.80(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.80(j) and 600.80(j) to indicate where guidelines for the submission of
adverse experience reports may be obtained. In addition, FDA is adding this information in &sect;310.305(g) for
the submission of adverse experience reports for prescription drugs without an approved application. For human
drug products, the guidelines may be obtained from the CDER Executive Secretariat Staff (HFD&hyph;8), Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, and for licensed
biological products from the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM&hyph;12), Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
M. Proposed Implementation Scheme
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 30 days after its date of publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All applications for human drug or licensed biological products approved on or after the effective date of any final
regulation would be subject to the periodic reporting time periods based on the international birth date. All human
drug and licensed biological product applications approved before the effective date of any final regulation would
use the U.S. approval date as the international birth date.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic costs imposed on the industry as a result of this proposed rule are the costs associated with reporting
deaths, serious adverse experiences, or clinical study discontinuations. Reporting burdens on the industry resulting
from FDA regulations are analyzed under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Based on an estimated total of 480,602
annual burden hours, FDA has estimated that the total annual reporting cost to the industry as a result of this proposed
rule would be $ 24,030,100 (the estimated per hour cost to the industry is $ 50). In addition, the rule may increase certain
nonpaperwork activities. For example, added costs may result if the formal control groups suggested in &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(i)
prompts additional clinical trial control arms, or if the implementation of the followup plan required in &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k)
provokes more elaborate monitoring procedures. At this time, FDA cannot predict the extent of these actions, but
welcomes public comment on issues regarding the scope or cost of these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. The agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis
is required.

Description
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: FDA is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting requirements to replace current Form FDA&hyph;1639
with new FDA Form 3500A; to revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats; to require applicants or
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences;
and to make other revisions to provide uniformity to the reporting regulations. These changes would simplify and
facilitate the reporting of adverse events and product problems under a single form and help harmonize international
adverse event reporting requirements. In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the sponsor reporting requirements
in part 312.

: Businesses or other for profit and small businesses or organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The burden hours for &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80 are approved under OMB information collection number 0910&hyph;0230.
The burden hours for &sect;600.80 have been submitted to OMB for approval and can be found elsewhere in this issue of
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA estimates no change in the burden hours that have already been approved. OMB has approved use of the new form, under
OMB information collection number 0910&hyph;0291, through December 1994. The new recordkeeping requirements
under &sect;310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii), that applicants or manufacturers, packers,
and distributors maintain records of unsuccessful attempts to obtain additional followup information on 15-day
``Alert reports,'' would be negligible and would result in no change in the burden hours that have already been approved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new requirements under &sect;&sect;310.305(a), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b), that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting
of adverse experiences, would not impose a new burden because they codify a practice that is already customary and
usual in the pharmaceutical industry for handling adverse experiences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The more extensive list of contents for the periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, in proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(ii)
and 600.80(c)(2)(ii), would result in an increased reporting burden on the industry. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed periodic reporting requirements would require, on an average, 19 additional hours for respondents
to prepare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also increase the reporting requirements for sponsors under part 312. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed amendments to part 312 would result in an increase of 167,900 burden hours on the industry.

Definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the Food and Drug Administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adverse drug experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including
the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse
event occurring from drug overdose; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected
pharmacological action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse drug experience, e.g., an increased number of reports
of particular adverse drug experience after appropriate adjustment for drug exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-threatening
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse drug experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have
caused death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not
be considered life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic
reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, although angioedema of the larynx, allergic
bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unexpected
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event
that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differs from
the event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would
be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatitic enzymes or hepatitis.
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity)
if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall report to FDA adverse drug experience information
as described in this section and shall submit one copy of each report to the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance
(HFD&hyph;730), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20857.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15&hyph;Day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) Any person whose name appears on the label of a marketed prescription drug product as its manufacturer, packer,
or distributor shall report to FDA each adverse drug experience received or otherwise obtained that is both serious
and unexpected as soon as possible, but in any case, within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information.
Each report shall be accompanied by a copy of the current labeling for the drug product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is not required to submit a 15-day ``Alert report''
for an adverse drug experience obtained from a postmarketing study (whether or not conducted under an investigational
new drug application) unless the applicant concludes that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused
the adverse experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15&hyph;Day ``Alert reports''_followup
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall promptly investigate all serious, unexpected
adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these 15-day postmarketing Alert reports and shall submit followup
reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional information is
not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful steps taken to seek additional information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall review periodically (at least twice each year)
the frequency of reports of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), received or otherwise obtained, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon
as possible, but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists.
Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time
period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results) rather
than using FDA Form 3500A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission of, and followup to, reports required in this section,
including reports required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a packer's or distributor's obligations may be met
by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences to the manufacturer of the drug product. If a packer
or distributor elects to submit these adverse drug experience reports to the manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall
submit each report to the manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the packer or distributor, and the manufacturer
shall then comply with the requirements of this section even if its name does not appear on the label of the drug product.
Under this circumstance, the packer or distributor shall maintain a record of this action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A copy of each drug experience report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Date the report was received by the packer or distributor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Date the report was submitted to the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to the sponsor immediately. This would ordinarily include any death, any life-threatening event, any serious event
that might reflect potential toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, laboratory values that exceed specified
limits, or any markedly abnormal laboratory value. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications for the disease. The events are to be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or to other medications the patient may have received. This section
of the protocol shall include instructions for the investigator encountering such an event, such as reporting requirements,
a remeasurement or challenge procedure, or discontinuation of the study drug.

adverse experiences that exceed these estimates would create a presumption that the events are associated with the
use of the investigational drug.

procedures based on preclinical data, experience with other members of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action,
and prior human experience. The sponsor shall include a brief description of the rationale used in selecting the followup
period and procedures. The intensity of the followup may change with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled
for 2 weeks after the end of drug dosing, with a telephone followup at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies,
there should be at least telephone followup for 3 months after drug dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes
and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. In some cases, available information may dictate followup periods
longer than 3 months.

period following the day the IND goes into effect, and for each 6-month period thereafter, until the end of the followup
period specified in the protocol. The report shall be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual
safety report that is due during the same period as the annual report required under paragraph (a) of this section shall
be submitted with the annual report. These semiannual reports shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A summary and analysis of all deaths, all serious adverse experiences, and all study discontinuations resulting
from an adverse experience that occurred during the study or within the prescribed followup period, whether the deaths
or adverse experiences were expected or unexpected and whether or not there is thought to be a possibility that the
death or adverse experience or study discontinuation was caused by the drug. This summary shall include data not only
from studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide,
with an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be
related to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous
or required reporting systems. For purposes of this section, serious adverse events shall include laboratory changes
identified in the study protocol as reportable events or that result in discontinuation. The sponsor shall present
in the summary both the data that accumulated during the reporting period and cumulatively. The sponsor shall also
submit an analysis of the data that assumes that the investigational drug is responsible for the deaths, serious adverse
experiences, and study discontinuations, and refute, as feasible, this presumption with appropriate data and evaluations.
The expected incidence of deaths and serious adverse experiences in the study population that may arise from the underlying
disease or from medications used to treat the underlying disease that was estimated in the protocol should be considered
in this evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All available autopsy reports and terminal medical reports concerning all deaths reported in this summary, with
a discussion of any inconsistencies between autopsy and medical reports and the cause of death reported to FDA by the
sponsor.

death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal.

shall submit two copies of each report described in this section to the Central Document Room, Park Bldg., rm. 2&hyph;14,
12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FDA may waive the requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicant shall report each adverse drug experience that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible but
in any case within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information. These reports shall be submitted on FDA Form
3500A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

. The applicant shall promptly investigate all adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing
15-day Alert reports and shall submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as
requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful
steps taken to seek additional information. These postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and followups to them shall
be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a postmarketing
adverse drug experience periodic report.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicant shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the frequency of reports
of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic failure (lack of effect),
regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible but in any case within 15
calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written notice, FDA may require
that applicants review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse drug experiences at intervals different
than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in
narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the
interpretation of the results), rather than using FDA Form 3500A. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency
are required to be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic
report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, concerning the submission
of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, shall also apply to any person (other than the applicant) whose name appears
on the label of an approved drug product as a manufacturer, packer, or distributor. However, in order to avoid unnecessary
duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of
this section, obligations of a nonapplicant may be met by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences
to the applicant. If a nonapplicant elects to submit adverse drug experience reports to the applicant rather than
to FDA, it shall submit each report to the applicant within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the nonapplicant, and the
applicant shall then comply with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the nonapplicant shall
maintain a record of this action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A copy of the drug experience report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Date the report was received by the nonapplicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Date the report was submitted to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Name and address of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report identification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic adverse drug experience reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The applicant shall report every 6 months each adverse drug experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
human drug product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. Periodic reports shall be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice,
FDA may require that the applicant submit reports under this section at times other than those stated. An applicant
who wishes to submit periodic reports at different intervals must submit to FDA a request for a waiver under &sect;314.90.
Followup information to adverse drug experiences submitted initially in a periodic report may be submitted in the
next periodic report. If the applicant does not receive any adverse experience reports during the reporting period,
the applicant shall, in place of a periodic report, send a copy of the current approved U.S. labeling and a letter identifying
the product, the application number, and the reporting period, stating that no adverse drug experience reports were
received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each periodic report shall contain:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title page, table of contents, and introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The introduction shall be a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicant's core safety data sheet
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicant's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in paragraph (a)
of this section shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is unexpected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. If an adverse event is not listed in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety
data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall safety evaluation'' (see paragraph (c)(2) (ii)(H) of this
section). This section also shall highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's
core safety data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it shall clearly be stated in this section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The product's marketing status
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a table containing a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory decisions affecting the product and all market launches) from the date it was first approved through
its current status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons shall be included at a minimum.
The product shall be listed by chemical (or proper name) and brand name(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory actions for safety reasons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a narrative identifying the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
includes, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Patient exposure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This shall be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer to estimate
patient exposure shall always be described and shall include the total number of dosage units of each dosage form and
strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Life-threatening
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal.

Reporting requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report to FDA adverse experience information, as described in this section. The
licensed manufacturer shall submit two copies of each report described in this section for nonvaccine biological
products to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;210), Food and Drug Administration, 1401
Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448. Submit all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine adverse experience reports to: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), P.O. Box 1100, Rockville,
MD 20849&hyph;1100. FDA may waive the requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible,
but in any case within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information. These reports shall be submitted for
nonvaccine biological products on FDA Form 3500A, and, for vaccines, on a VAERS form.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''_followup
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall promptly investigate all adverse experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing
15-day Alert reports and shall submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as
requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful
steps taken to seek additional information. These postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and followups to them shall
be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a postmarketing
adverse experience periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the frequency
of reports of adverse biological product experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible
but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written
notice, FDA may require that licensed manufacturers review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse
biological experiences at intervals different than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase
in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency
is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results), rather than using the form designated by
FDA. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency are required to be submitted under separate cover and may not
be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(i)(iii) of this section, concerning the submission
of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, shall also apply to any person (other than the licensed manufacturer of the
final product) whose name appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer, packer, distributor,
shared manufacturer, joint manufacturer, or any other participant involved in divided manufacturing. However,
in order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii),
and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, obligations of a manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer, including
a licensed manufacturer of the product other than in its final form, may be met by submission of all reports of serious
adverse experiences to the licensed manufacturer of the final product. If a manufacturer, other than the licensed
manufacturer, elects to submit reports to the licensed manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall submit each report
to the licensed manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt, and the licensed manufacturer shall then comply
with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the manufacturer shall maintain a record of this
action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A copy of all adverse biological product experience reports submitted to the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Date the report was received by the manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Date the report was submitted to the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Name and address of the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report identification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic adverse experience reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report every 6 months each adverse experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
biological product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock- point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. Periodic reports shall be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice,
FDA may require that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under this section at times other than those stated.
A licensed manufacturer who wishes to submit periodic reports at different intervals must submit to FDA a request
for a waiver under &sect;600.90. Followup information to adverse experiences submitted in a periodic report may
be submitted in the next periodic report. If the licensed manufacturer does not receive any adverse experience reports
during the reporting period, the licensed manufacturer shall, in place of a periodic report, send a copy of the current
approved U.S. labeling and a letter identifying the product, the application number, and the reporting period, stating
that no adverse experience reports were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each periodic report shall contain:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title page, table of contents, and introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The introduction shall be a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the licensed manufacturer that
contains all relevant safety information, including adverse experiences, which the licensed manufacturer believes
should be listed for the licensed biological product in all countries where the licensed biological product is marketed.
It may be used by the licensed manufacturer as the reference document by which an adverse experience is judged to be
expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other determinations of whether
an adverse experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the licensed manufacturer to multiple
countries and the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the licensed manufacturer's
core safety data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is unexpected
or not may result in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved
product label. This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included
in it than the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet. If an adverse event is not listed in the U.S. label, but
is in the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall safety evaluation''
(see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(H) of this section). This section also shall highlight clearly any changes and the reasons
for the changes in the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic
report.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) A licensed manufacturer may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse
experiences are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If a licensed manufacturer chooses to use the
approved U.S. label for this purpose, it shall clearly be stated in this section of the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The product's marketing status
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a table containing a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory decisions affecting the product and all market launches) from the date it was first approved through
its current status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons shall be included at a minimum.
The product shall be listed by chemical (or proper name) and brand name(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory actions for safety reasons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a narrative identifying the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
includes, for example, licensed application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution
restrictions, clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications,
or pharmaceutical changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Patient exposure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This shall be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the licensed manufacturer
to estimate patient exposure shall always be described and shall include the total number of dosage units of each dosage
form and strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. This section
shall end with an analysis by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The licensed manufacturer shall
also attach to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A or VAERS form for all U.S. spontaneous
reports of adverse experiences except those reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section,
or those sent by FDA to the licensed manufacturer.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Distribution reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall submit information about the quantity of the product distributed under the product
license, including the quantity distributed to distributors. The interval between distribution reports shall
be 6 months. The reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the biological product. The first
6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved in the United States is the
data lock-point for the first reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary of the international birth date
is the data lock-point for subsequent reporting terms for that particular product. Distribution reports shall be
submitted to FDA within 45 calendar days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice, FDA may require that the licensed
manufacturer submit distribution reports under this section at times other than every 6 months. The distribution
report shall consist of the bulk lot number (from which the final container was filled), the fill lot numbers for the
total number of dosage units of each strength or potency distributed (e.g., 50,000/10-milliliter vials), the label
lot number (if different from fill lot number), labeled date of expiration, number of doses in fill lot/label lot,
date of release of fill lot/label lot released for distribution at that time. If any significant amount of a fill lot/label
lot is returned, include this information. Disclosure of financial or pricing data is not required. As needed, FDA
may require submission of more detailed product distribution information. Upon written notice, FDA may require
that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under this section at times other than those stated. A licensed manufacturer
that wishes to submit reports at times other than those stated should submit a request for a waiver under &sect;600.90.

Loan Guarantees to Israel; Notice of Investment Opportunity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government of Israel (the ``GOI'') wishes to select managing underwriters for the structuring and sale of U.S.
Agency for International Development (``USAID'')-guaranteed loans. The USAID-guaranteed loans have been authorized
by Public Law 102&hyph;391, and are being provided in connection with Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort
to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation authorizes the guaranty by USAID of up to $10 billion principal amount of loans over the next five years,
with a maximum of $2 billion in loans, offered in one or more tranches, to be guaranteed in each of the five fiscal years.
This Notice is in connection with the GOI's selection of managing underwriters for one or more offerings contemplated
to be made under the authorization for the current fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GOI would like to receive proposals from interested underwriters on an expedited basis. A Request for Proposals
(``RFP'') will be available from the GOI on or about October 26, 1994. Proposals must be submitted, in accordance with
the RFP, by 4:00 p.m. on October 31, 1994. For information regarding the submission of proposals, please contact Mr.
Eliahu Ziv-Zitouk, Chief Fiscal Officer, Ministry of Finance of the Government of Israel, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York 10118 (fax: 212/736&hyph;2759).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To accomplish the GOI's objectives, the GOI's lead manager must at a minimum:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Perform and discuss with the GOI and its financial advisor a complete quantitative analysis of the cash flows generated
by the proposed structures and proposed pricing of securities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Complete the underwriting of all securities offered for sale;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Establish and maintain a post-sale trading market for the securities; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Coordinate all activities relating to the proposed financing plan with the GOI and its financial advisor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selection of underwriters and the terms of the loans are initially subject to the individual discretion of the GOI
and thereafter subject to approval by USAID. In order to be eligible for selection as a managing underwriter, an institution
must be a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, and otherwise meet the legal requirements for
serving in such role.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. To be eligible for an USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable
in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of the disbursement of the principal amount thereof. The USAID guaranty
will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in
Section 226 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. Disbursements under the loans will be subject to certain
conditions required of the GOI by USAID as set forth in agreements between USAID and the GOI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information regarding USAID's responsibilities in this guaranty program can be obtained from the undersigned:
Room 225, 515 22nd Street NW., Washington, DC 20523&hyph;0235, telephone: 202/663&hyph;2771.

We are advising the public that an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the renewal of a permit to allow the field testing of genetically
engineered organisms. The environmental assessment provides a basis for our conclusion that the field testing of
the genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant pest and will
not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its finding of no significant impact,
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statement need not be
prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued a permit for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the field tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of a permit to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Technology Administration's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announces available funding
for various competitions under the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). During 1995, the ATP will hold the following
competitions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) General Competition 95&hyph;01 in which proposals in all areas of technology meeting the ATP criteria are solicited,
and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Several Program Competitions focused on specific technology or technology application areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice provides general information for all the competitions planned for 1995. Proposal due dates, program
competition topics, and other competition-specific instructions for the General Competition and each of the Program
Competitions will be published in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) at a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those interested in applying for ATP funding must contact the ATP at the address shown later in this notice to obtain
application materials. The Proposal Preparation Kit available upon request from the ATP contains the application
forms, background material, and instructions referenced in this notice. The new ATP Proposal Preparation Kit may
be used either for General Competitions or Program Competitions. The Advanced Technology Program is Program Number
11.612 in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due dates for the general and program competition will be published in the CBD at the time each competition is announced.
Should there ever be an extension of the due date for any ATP competition, that information will be provided via a notice
published in the CBD as well as a recorded message on the ATP toll-free ``Hotline'' number (1&hyph;800&hyph;ATP&hyph;FUND).
For this reason, we recommend that applicants check this recorded message prior to the closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific date and location will be announced in the CBD regarding a public meeting for parties considering applying
for funding in the ATP General Competition 95&hyph;01. Attendance at this public meeting is not required of potential
proposers. The purpose of the meeting is to provide general information regarding the ATP procedures, selection
process, and proposal preparation to potential applicants unfamiliar with the ATP. No discussion of specific proposals
will occur at this meeting. Dates and times of analogous public meetings for the program competitions will be announced
in the CBD, transmitted to those on the ATP mailing list, and described on the ATP toll-free Hotline.

products, and services. Through cooperative agreements with individual companies or groups of companies, large
and small, the ATP invests in industrial projects to develop technologies with high-payoff potential for the nation.
The ATP accelerates technologies that_because they are risky_are unlikely to be developed in time to compete in rapidly
changing world markets without such a partnership of industry and government. By sharing the cost of such projects,
the ATP catalyzes industry to pursue promising technologies. The Proposal Preparation Kit expands on the goals of
the ATP and describes in detail what constitutes a good ATP proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATP operates under program procedures published at part 295, title 15, of the Code of Federal Regulations. These
procedures were updated (59 FR, page 663, January 6, 1994). A copy of the updated version of these procedures is provided
in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooperative research agreements rather than grants are the funding instruments used for ATP awards. A cooperative
research agreement differs from a grant with respect to the amount of interaction between the Federal Government
and the recipient, and is used to provide financial assistance when substantial involvement is anticipated between
the government and the recipient.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The ATP CBD notices to be published later will invite applications for funding from:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Individual United States businesses in amounts not to exceed $2 million (federal share) over three years. Single
applicants must fund all indirect costs associated with the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Industry-led joint research and development ventures, where ATP support will serve as a catalyst for the proposed
joint venture project, and provided, however, that the ATP share is a minority share of the cost of the venture for up
to five years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant eligibility is discussed in detail in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. Future or continued funding for multi-year projects
will be at the discretion of NIST and will be contingent on such factors as satisfactory performance and the availability
of funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Abbreviated Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ATP reserves the right to use abbreviated proposal for any general or program competition. Information regarding
the use of abbreviated proposals will be included in the CBD announcement of that specific competition. The purpose
of abbreviated proposals is to provide applicants with limited resources early feedback regarding whether the proposed
project falls within the scope of the ATP and whether the project proposed appears sufficiently promising relative
to the selection criteria to warrant preparation of a full proposal. In competitions where abbreviated proposals
are accepted, applicants who submit such proposals will be notified in writing whether or not ATP recommends submission
of a full proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATP may provide feedback to proposers in one of the following three ways:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) (Used for abbreviated proposals only); A written transmittal giving a yes/no recommendation regarding preparation
of a full proposal;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A checklist noting concerns regarding the proposal or abbreviated proposal. This transmittal may be accompanied
by a statement summarizing common shortcomings noted in the proposals submitted to that competition;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An oral debriefing by telephone summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Which of these feedback mechanisms is used will depend on the competition and may depend on the number of proposals
received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proprietary information is abbreviated and full proposals will be protected. If your proposal contains proprietary
information, mark it accordingly; however, the title page must not include proprietary information. We recommend
including the following legend on the title page: ``Proposal contains proprietary information. Title page nonproprietary.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Full proposals must be prepared in accordance with the instructions in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit. In competitions
involving abbreviated proposals, heed the general advice provided in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit, but follow
the specific instructions announced in the specific CBD announcements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Funds Available for Cooperative Research Agreements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
An estimated $20 to $25 million in first-year funding will be available for General Competition 95&hyph;01. The number
of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the amount of funding requested by the proposals
under consideration for awards. Based on ATP's experience the number of awards is unlikely to exceed 30. An estimated
$100 to $125 million in first-year funding will be available for the several program competition to be announced.
For every ATP competition, NIST reserves the right to fund proposals totalling more or less than the amount of funding
tentatively allocated to that competition if the number of high quality proposals received is judged to be greater
or fewer respectively than anticipated.

Preparation of Full Proposal and Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The ATP Proposal Preparation Kit, available from the ATP, contains background material on the ATP, detailed contents
and formatting guidelines for the preparation of full proposals, and the required forms. Also included is information
of reporting and audit requirements for recipients. To be accepted for review, full proposals must meet all of the
requirements outlined in the Kit. Full proposals that fail to meet one or more of those requirements will be considered
non-responsive to the solicitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
An applicant may submit a full proposal that is a revised version of a full proposal submitted to a previous ATP competition.
NIST will examine such proposals to determine whether substantial revisions have been made. Where the revisions
are determined not to be substantial, NIST reserves the right to score and rank, or where appropriate, to reject, such
proposals based on reviews of the previously-submitted proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NIST reserves the right to transfer a full proposal received in response to a General Competition invitation to a Program
Competition underway in the same general timeframe if the subject matter of the proposal clearly falls within the
scope of the Program Competition. NIST will not transfer proposals from Program Competitions to General Competitions.
Applicants will be notified if and when a proposal is transferred from a General Competition to a Program Competition.

Other Requirements, Requests, and Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant or recipient who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt
until either the delinquent account is paid in full, a negotiated repayment schedule is established and at least one
payment is received, or other arrangements satisfactory to the Department are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All for-profit and nonprofit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal
if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges
such as fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty
or financial integrity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If applicants incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own risk of not being reimbursed
by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal or written assurance that may have been received, there is no obligation
on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A false statement on any application for funding under ATP may be grounds for denial or termination of funds and grounds
for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001. The ATP does not involve the mandatory
payment of any matching funds from state or local government and does not affect directly any state or local government.
Accordingly, the Department of Commerce has determined that Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review
of Federal Programs'' is not applicable to this program. Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal
laws and Federal and Department of Commerce policies, regulations and procedures applicable to financial assistance
awards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants are hereby notified that any equipment or products authorized to be purchased with funding provided under
this program must be American-made to the maximum extent feasible in accordance with Public Law 103&hyph;317, section
607 (a) and (b). Adequate justification will be required for any proposed purchase of equipment or products that are
not American-made.

The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) is proposing changes and inviting comments
with regard to three of its main programs: AmeriCorps*USA, Learn &amp; Serve America K&hyph;12, and Learn &amp; Serve
America Higher Education. This notice is divided into three parts corresponding to these programs. The proposed
changes_which would apply to the FY 1995 grant cycle_were developed in response to lessons learned with the completion
of the Corporation's first grant cycle and are non-regulatory in nature. A broad range of areas is covered, including
the following: a revised timeline; revised applications; proposed criteria for the renewal of grants; revised priorities
within the main issue areas of education, public safety, human needs and the environment; guidelines for the continued
improvement of programs; revisions to the selection criteria for programs; and additional priorities that will
be given in the selection processes. The Corporation invites all interested parties to comment on the issues discussed
in this notice. Any comments received will be given careful consideration in the development of final FY 1995 policies
and grant applications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
B. Conversion of Planning Grants to Operating Grants for Formula-Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Corporation is recommending that State Commissions give priority to converting Formula-funded planning grants
to operational programs over new applications, if the proposals meet quality standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->

The Corporation will give priority to expanding the number of members in existing program sites, and to expanding
the number of sites themselves, if the program has a solid track record and sound needs and plans for expansion and meets
the other criteria for renewal. If the expansion request exceeds 25% of the Year One budget or the planned expansion
is to base the program in two different cities, then the program expansion will be considered a new application and
will not receive priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
D. Issue Area Priorities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Corporation has not changed the priority area emphases for renewals. This decision reflects the Corporation's
belief that the extension of these priorities during the renewal process will contribute to building successful
programs and stronger relationships with the field. The priority areas for renewals are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In addition to those preferences and objectives described by the Corporation's statute and regulations, the Corporation's
recommendations reflect our objectives of encouraging new applicants to focus on our new priorities. The Corporation's
recommendations reflect our objective to encourage the tailoring of our FY 1994 priorities for new applicants. The
Corporation will solicit proposals for new programs which supplement the existing range of AmeriCorps programs,
including new models in priority areas not covered by existing programs.

A. Issue Areas To Be Targeted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Outlined below are staff recommendations on the issue areas to be targeted for new state competitive and national
direct program applications:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Community Policing_Supporting community policing efforts through building partnerships with neighborhood
residents, identifying community problems, and working with police officers to solve these problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Victim Assistance_Working on programs in public agencies or community-based organizations to provide a wide
range of support services to victims of crime and to help link victims to other providers of information and services
within the justice system and community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Neighborhood Environment_Initiate innovative grass-roots programs in low income neighborhoods that promote
sustainable communities by reducing environmental risks, and conserving natural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Early childhood development_Improve the health and school readiness of young children through child care, Head
Start, and other pre-school programs; programs to improve parenting skills and community-based efforts to provide
comprehensive services to families with young children (including pregnant women).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. School Success_Broaden or coordinate the range of services available through schools such as tutoring, after-school
enrichment programs, service-learning, health and child care service and efforts to involve parents in their children's
education as part of a comprehensive strategy to improve school achievement and student retention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
B. Programmatic Preferences
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Corporation will give preferences to new applicants who integrate the following into their proposals:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Concentration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Corporation is encouraging programs to concentrate the efforts of AmeriCorps Members. In general, preference
will be given to programs that propose service activities at fewer sites rather than more sites, that focus activities
in the priority areas, and that involve groups of Corps Members in contrast to individually-placed Corps Members.
Similarly, programs that regularly bring Corps Members together for training, identity, and service will be preferred
over those that propose more diffused organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Specialization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Programs that propose to develop priority area specializations are accorded preference over programs with a more
generalist focus. Specifically not encouraged are programs that propose to engage Corps Members in many activities
addressing many priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
3. Diversity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Programs that show a specific strategy for attracting members with diverse backgrounds will be given a preference.
The Corporation encourages programs to treat diversity broadly, searching beyond their ordinary participant base
to include, for example, individuals from other ethnic groups and people with disabilities. Programs are encouraged,
if appropriate, to include intergenerational components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
4. Education Awards Only
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Because the Corporation has more funds available for education awards than for program costs, we continue to urge
applicants that have adequate resources to cover program costs to request education awards only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
C. Localities for Concentration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities and areas affected by military downsizing. The Corporation will accord
special consideration to applicants who propose to sponsor AmeriCorps service activities in officially-designated
empowerment zones or enterprise communities, and areas impacted by military downsizing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
D. Selection Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Selection criteria for new applicants remain those established in 1994, based on the quality of the proposal and the
proposed program's ability to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Get things done in communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Strengthen communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Expand opportunities for members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Encourage responsibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Be innovative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Be replicated in other areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Be sustained beyond Corporation support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Learn and Serve America K&hyph;12 Grant Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
All Learn and Serve America: School- and Community-Based Programs address needs within at least one of the four priority
areas of the Corporation: Environment, Education, Human Needs and Public Safety. Because the objectives of Learn
and Serve America focus more on education reform and participant development, however, it is critical for us to focus
primarily on program improvement and quality priorities, rather than issue areas. Therefore the policies and priorities
for renewals of existing grantees and new applicants are the same.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Corporation recommends that consideration of past performance be based on whether the grantee has:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Made reasonable progress toward accomplishing project goals and objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
II. Priority Areas for New Grants and Renewals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In addition to those objectives and priorities described by the Corporation statute and regulations, the Corporation
is recommending that new and existing grantees be requested to address the following priorities in their Learn and
Serve America plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
A. State Infrastructure/Capacity Building
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
An effective service-learning state infrastructure includes a statewide network of service-learning practitioners,
policy makers and members who advocate the advancement of service-learning methodology. This infrastructure also
includes state financial and human resources committed to service-learning efforts, as well as state level support
for service-learning. Infrastructure is key to realizing the full potential of service-learning to reform education
and rebuild communities. There is a need to build both legislative and financial support at the state level, especially
as future federal funding may not be available. Priority will be given to state plans that institutionalize service-learning,
as well as those that leverage dollars at the state and local levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
B. Partnerships With Other Education Reform Efforts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To help build the infrastructure needed to support service-learning as a methodology for education reform, the Corporation
will encourage linkages with other education reform efforts, such as Goals 2000, School-to-Work transition and
middle grades restructuring. States will be encouraged to promote such linkages through advocating for the inclusion
of service-learning language in state education reform legislation and school board policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connections to state and federal education reform efforts help promote institutionalization and sustainability.
As states consider school restructuring or the new methodology of education reformers, the Corporation should encourage
them to include service-learning in their plans. Priority will be given to programs that utilize dollars from other
federal education legislation or promote linkage with state level reform efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
C. Qualitative/Quantitative Research and Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Up to this point, the service-learning research focus has been mainly on personal development with data collection
being mostly anecdotal. To further expand and sustain service-learning as a legitimate pedagogy, the field needs
a solid base of research to support it. Once academic improvement is solidly documented, more members of the education
community will support service-learning as a legitimate tool for education reform. Priority will be granted to proposals
which plan to document service-learning outcomes, especially those focusing on measurement of improved academic
achievement and attendance, and reductions in disciplinary actions. This type of solid research will be useful during
the reauthorization process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
D. Coordinated Streams of Service
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
When all CNCS grantees in a given state work together, it is possible to ``get things done'' more effectively and efficiently.
AmeriCorps Members can strengthen Learn and Service programs by serving as service-learning coordinators at the
school district or individual school level. Senior Corps members can offer valuable skills and experience to Learn
and Serve members through pre-service training and post-service reflection activities. Priority will be granted
to proposing linking the various streams of service in the state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
III. Renewal Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Corporation recommends renewing grants for one year only. This will allow Learn and Serve America staff to ensure
greater quality in plans and to promote program improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
IV. Program Components To Be Addressed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Corporation recommends that the following program components be addressed in FY 1995. These components were
identified by staff and outside peer reviewers as overall weaknesses in the proposals submitted under Learn and Serve
America in 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Academic Components
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Connections to the curriculum/education reform Proposals submitted this year demonstrate the need for the Corporation
to work with grantees at three levels of the service-learning integration continuum: awareness/basic introduction
to service-learning methodology; making clear connections to the academic curriculum; and articulating clear
academic outcomes and ways to measure those outcomes. If the Corporation is to fund service-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
learning 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
programs, then we need to work with grantees to enhance the academic components of their plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation recommends that grantees be encouraged to consider evaluation at three levels: information to be
collected for the national evaluation; evaluation of the work at the primary grantee level, such as State Education
Agency, State Commission, or national non-profit; and the evaluation of local program (subgrantee) activities.
Grantees will be encouraged to define clear, measurable goals and objectives, as well as to develop or select adequate
measurement tools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Innovation/Replicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation recommends grantees to seek viable approaches in achieving program replicability and innovation.
The Corporation encourages programs to work closely with the Learn and Serve America K&hyph;12 staff to establish
a framework to assist in the development of new ideas and the expansion of or building upon proven model programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Sustainability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation encourages grantees to design a clearly defined and detailed plan for program sustainability. Grantees
should articulate a comprehensive long-term plan that not only cites specific monetary and in-kind resources, but
incorporates state infrastructure and capacity building.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Coordination With Other Service Streams in the State
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Programs are encouraged to coordinate their service efforts with the state's service network, including youth,
educators, State Commission members, policy makers, parents, representatives from community organizations and
national nonprofits. Improving collaboration strengthens state service-learning efforts, presents a stronger,
more unified voice for service-learning at the state policy level, promotes sustainability and helps states achieve
goals with fewer dollars through resource sharing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Indian Tribes and U.S. Territories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation anticipates that its technical assistance and outreach efforts to Indian Tribes and Territories
will improve in Year Two. The Corporation encourages Indian Tribes and Territories to identify specific areas of
need so the Corporation may better assess less developed program areas and strengthen the overall quality of Indian
Tribe proposals for Year Two.

I. Policies and Guidelines for Renewals of Existing Grantees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Corporation anticipates renewing grants for existing programs that meet quality standards. Renewal
funding will not be automatic. Decisions will be based on two factors: progress to date (80%) and future plans (20%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Information on progress to date will be collected primarily through the semi-annual progress report (quarterly
report for demonstration programs) and secondarily through other methods, that include informal monitoring, contact
with program personnel and site visits. Progress reports will include the following information, which translate
into criteria for renewal decisions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Number of participants:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The degree to which recruitment goals have been met. The amount of attrition observed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Service and learning activities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The quality of service placements. The degree to which activities are well-supervised, well-suited to participants'
skill and training, and designed to achieve demonstrable impacts on community needs. The quality of reflection activities.
The clarity of learning objectives associated with these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Implementation:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The extent to which high-quality program staff have been recruited, selected, trained, and placed. The degree
to which the program is following its timeline and implementation plan. The reasonableness of explanations for deviations
from or adjustments to the timeline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Progress toward objectives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The degree to which there is quantitative or other evidence of progress toward approved objectives related to community,
participants, and institutional impacts. The degree to which the program has developed a system to collect data and
demonstrate outcomes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Progress toward sustainability:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The degree to which the program has explored alternative sources of funding and built stronger institutional and
community support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Important findings from internal evaluation and monitoring:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The reliability of mechanisms for feedback and continuous improvement. The degree to which participants, service
beneficiaries, and partners are satisfied with the program. The extent to which the program has identified problems,
areas for improvement, or lessons learned, and taken appropriate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Financial management and match:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The extent to which the match has been raised. The extent to which a fundraising plan has been developed. The extent
to which quarterly financial reports and up-to-date records of line-item expenditures show balanced and appropriate
spending across program areas. The reasonableness of explanations for unusually low or high expenditures in particular
budget lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In addition, in making renewal decisions, the Corporation will take into account grantees' responsiveness to
inquiries and requests from program staff and their timeliness in notifying program staff of major problems in implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Information on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
future plans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 will be collected through a brief application for renewal funding. Proposals should build on progress in the previous
year, reflecting lessons learned and actions that correct weakenesses. The information will include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Clear outcome objectives for the next year, consistent with objectives for the current year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Next year's activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Implementation plan and timeline, reflecting lessons learned from the current year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. An update on expenditures and obligations under the current grant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Next year's budget with detailed narrative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, first-year programs (non-demonstration) may apply for 90 percent of their current grant amounts. Second-year
programs may apply for 80 percent of their current grant amounts.

Current demonstration programs with AmeriCorps Members may maintain or expand the number of Members (up to 25 percent,
in general). In the second year application, programs proposing expansion will be required to justify the expansion
in terms of need, organizational capacity, success in first-year implementation, and adequacy of plans for managing
expansion. Part-time programs with AmeriCorps Members whose terms of service are longer than one year may propose
a new class of AmeriCorps Members in the second year. Such a proposal constitutes an expansion.

II. Policies and Guidelines for New Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Corporation intends to streamline FY 1995 applicants into one of three categories that reflect major distinctions
in program design and activities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Individual institution of higher education or partnership,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consortium, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Demonstration program with AmeriCorps Members. Some proposal narrative guidelines and selection criteria
will apply to all three categories. Other guidelines and criteria will apply specifically to one but not the others.
Instead of listing specific criteria for public comment, the Corporation has decided to invite direct input on what
criteria should apply to each category. In particular, the Corporation welcomes input on the development of criteria
appropriate for consortium applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Overall, the selection criteria will build on those established in the FY 1994 application. The FY 1995 guidelines
will reflect the following key points:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Corporation will reaffirm the Learn and Serve America program's emphasis on building capacity and strengthening
infrastructure, in particular by setting clear narrative guidelines and selection criteria specifically for consortium
applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Corporation will place added emphasis on the applicant's ability to articulate clear objectives with demonstrable
outcomes and means of assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Corporation will encourage programs to focus on a single issue area or community need, instead of scattering
activities among several areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The Corporation will give priority to applicants according to the following guidelines:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The issue areas to be targeted under AmeriCorps*USA also will apply to Learn and Serve America: Higher Education.
These are community policing, victim assistance, neighborhood environment, early childhood development, and
school success.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In order to fund an array of institutions that reflects the diversity of American higher education, the Corporation
will give priority to programs involving community colleges, HBCUs, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribally
controlled colleges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Corporation may give priority to certain applicants in order to achieve geographic diversity among funded
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The Corporation will continue to fund demonstration programs that involve AmeriCorps Members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. New demonstration programs must have both a strong focus on a national priority and an emphasis on building service-learning
capacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Corporation will give preference to programs that involve at least 20 AmeriCorps Members overall, that place
Members in teams of two or more at each project site, that propose service activities at fewer rather than more sites,
and that focus activities in a single issue area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Corporation will structure grants to new demonstration programs so that the length of the grant parallels the
Members' terms of service. For example, if a program engages part-time Members in a two-year term, then the FY 1995
grant will include funds for two years, with release of funds in the second year contingent upon performance in the
first year and availability of appropriations. Part-time terms spanning three years will be discouraged.

<SUMMARY>

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE announces its intent to prepare an EIS pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C.
4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions
of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and the DOE implementing procedures (10 CFR part 1021). DOE invites public comment
and will conduct a series of public scoping meetings to provide an opportunity for the public and interested agencies
to comment on the alternatives and the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would clean out inactive PFP complex facilities (except for storage areas), stabilize reactive
residual plutonium-bearing materials to a form suitable for long term storage, and store the stabilized material
until DOE makes final storage and disposition decisions. The proposed action would minimize safety concerns, reduce
the exposure of site workers to radiation, and reduce the risk to the public. Upon completion of the action, the PFP-complex
would be deactivated to a state ready for potential decontamination and dismantlement (D&amp;D) and/or potential
future uses. Additional NEPA documentation will be prepared by DOE before any decision is made to D&amp;D the PFP and/or
to use it for other purposes. At this time, no future missions beyond continued vault storage have been identified
for the PFP-complex. Future production of plutonium for defense purposes is not being proposed and is not part of Hanford's
current mission. Existing vault storage of nuclear materials would continue pending future NEPA documentation
and a DOE decision on the ultimate storage or disposition of the materials; on June 21, 1994, DOE issued a NOI to prepare
a programmatic EIS on the storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials.

 DOE invites all interested parties, including affected Federal, State and local agencies, Indian Nations, and the
general public to submit comments or suggestions concerning the scope of the issues to be addressed, alternatives
to be analyzed, and the environmental impacts to be assessed in the Plutonium Finishing Plant Cleanout EIS by December
12, 1994. To ensure that all relevant environmental issues are considered, the public, agencies, and organizations
are also invited to attend public scoping workshops in which oral and written comments will be welcomed on the proposed
PFP EIS. Oral and written comments will be given equal weight in the scoping process. Written comments must be postmarked
by December 12, 1994 to ensure their consideration. Comments postmarked after that date will be considered to the
extent practicable.

Each public scoping workshop will begin with a welcome and brief overview of the proposed EIS and will include sub-workshops
on specific items of interest in which the public can ask questions and provide comments to DOE officials. Notes will
be taken in the sub-workshops to record public concerns for the official workshop record. Each workshop will conclude
with a session that will be recorded by a public stenographer and will become part of the official workshop record.
This portion of the workshop will be chaired by a presiding officer, but will not be conducted as an evidentiary hearing;
speakers will not be cross-examined although the presiding officer and DOE representatives may ask clarifying questions.
Individuals requesting to speak on behalf of an organization must identify the organization. In the interest of ensuring
that all who wish to speak have an opportunity to do so, each individual speaker will be given a 5-minute limit except
that a speaker representing an organization (one per organization) will be given a 10-minute limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda will be repeated twice a day at each location, in afternoon and evening sessions. The hours for the sessions
will be: 12:30 PM&hyph;1:30 PM (workshop session), 1:30 PM&hyph;4:30 PM (formal scoping meeting), 5:30 PM&hyph;6:30
PM (workshop session), and 6:30 PM&hyph;9:30 PM (formal scoping meeting).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal government began operating the Hanford Site, near Richland, Washington, in 1943 as part of the Manhattan
Project to produce plutonium for national defense purposes. Metallic uranium fuel was irradiated in nuclear reactors
at the Hanford Site to create plutonium, which was converted to plutonium nitrate and purified through chemical processing
for use in nuclear weapons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial production of plutonium metal at the PFP complex began in July, 1949. The complex is located on Hanford's 200
West Area Plateau approximately 32 miles northwest of Richland, Washington. The complex includes production areas,
reclamation processes, laboratories and plutonium storage vaults. Several defense missions were carried out within
the PFP complex. As the need arose, processes were installed in the PFP to recover as much plutonium as possible and
metal production capabilities were updated. Some of the process areas have been deactivated over the last 20 years;
however, plutonium recovery activities continued until the production mission ended in 1989. Secure materials
storage vaults have been in operation since the early 1960s. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today, operable areas of the complex include the Plutonium Reclamation Facility (PRF), the Remote Mechanical ``C''
(RMC) line plus process support and research laboratories, the secure storage vaults and support areas. About 240
employees work at the PFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOE believes the continued presence of relatively large quantities of chemically reactive materials in their
present form and location within the PFP poses an unacceptable long-term risk to the workers and the environment.
Consequently, in 1993, DOE announced its proposal to operate certain processes in the PFP to stabilize those materials
and to prepare an Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment (EA) pursuant to NEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the NEPA process for the proposed EA, DOE conducted public meetings in the summer and fall of 1993 in Richland,
WA; Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Hood River, OR; and Spokane, WA to discuss the proposal to stabilize the chemically
reactive materials. As a result of the public comments received, DOE decided that an EIS would be the appropriate level
of NEPA review. DOE also decided to expand the scope of review to include cleanout of the PFP (except for storage vaults)
to a state where the facility would be ready for D&amp;D and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To alleviate immediate safety concerns, interim actions have been taken or are underway to minimize the amount of
reactive residual materials left in process areas when the plutonium production mission ended in 1989. The range
of interim actions includes transferring solutions into vented metal containers for safe storage, repackaging
of certain solutions from plastic bottles to safer containers, cleanup of surface radioactive contamination to
reduce worker exposure, and removal of portions of ventilation ductwork and piping which contain residual plutonium.
The thermal stabilization of sludges is a proposed interim action being addressed by an EA currently in progress.
Other interim actions could be proposed during the EIS preparation period to address other specific safety concerns.
All interim actions are or will be covered by appropriate NEPA documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action would place the PFP complex in a state ready for potential D&amp;D and/or a future mission while
maintaining its current material storage capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose and Need for Agency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE needs to take action to minimize safety concerns, reduce the exposure of Hanford Site workers to radiation,
and reduce the risk to the public. The proposed action would clean out inactive PFP complex facilities (except storage
areas), stabilize reactive residual material for long-term storage, and store the stabilized material pending
a DOE decision on ultimate storage or disposition of fissile materials. Upon completion of the proposed action, the
PFP complex would be in a state ready for D&amp;D and/or future uses.

Preliminary Description of Cleanout Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following cleanout alternatives are currently being considered for detailed analysis in the EIS: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Wet Cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contaminated equipment or facility surfaces would be sprayed with or soaked or immersed in nitric acid and rinsed
with dilute acid. The rinse solutions would be collected in tankage and stabilized in a manner similar to other acid
solutions. Acid washing could be enhanced for greater cleaning by using additives such as cerium or silver persulfate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Mechanical Cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Methods for mechanical cleaning include abrasive blasting, wiping, scraping and brushing. Blasting would produce
a fine powder containing plutonium which would be collected and stabilized in a manner similar to other solids, then
stored in PFP vaults. Wiping or scraping would produce a similar powder, plus waste in the form of wiping materials
(rags, paper, etc.) These methods require workers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be close to contaminated surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preliminary Description of Stabilization Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PFP contains a variety of reactive plutonium-bearing materials that need to be stabilized for long-term storage
pending DOE decisions on ultimate storage or disposition. Stabilized material has minimal chemical reactivity
and generally would be in solid form with a low water or organic content to minimize radiolysis. Most of the reactive
materials are in process areas and equipment. (A portion of the materials stored in PFP vaults must also continue to
be repackaged and stabilized as necessary for long-term storage).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of analysis, the reactive materials have been divided into groups. The materials in each group are expected
to be amenable to the same stabilization process. The groups are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of these groups contains materials which are chemically dissimilar to materials in other groups and may require
separate stabilization processing. Therefore, the preferred stabilization alternative is likely to consist of
more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a single process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following stabilization alternatives are currently being considered for detailed analysis in the EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Stabilization via Plutonium Reclamation Facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative would involve the restart and operation of the Plutonium Reclamation Facility (PRF), portions
of the Remote Mechanical C (RMC) line and two small glovebox processes that would convert and stabilize chemically
reactive plutonium-bearing scrap for long-term storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PRF processes would be operated to convert certain plutonium-bearing materials to an aqueous solution. These
materials include the plutonium oxide powder, incinerator ash, and scrap solutions. These materials would be dissolved
with various acids and other chemicals to produce an impure plutonium nitrate solution. The process would use a heavy
organic solution to extract plutonium from other impurities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plutonium nitrate solutions would be converted to solid plutonium oxide, which is suitable for long-term storage.
The equipment for this conversion process would be remotely operated from a shielded control room. The process would
involve mixing the nitrate feed with oxalic acid to form a plutonium oxalate precipitate. The precipitate would be
filtered out of the liquid and thermally oxidized to plutonium oxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Direct Denitration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative would involve the operation of small scale equipment which could be installed within two to four
existing gloveboxes in the RMC processing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The denitration process would be operated to stabilize materials which can be dissolved in nitric acid to form a nitrate
solution. Materials would first be dissolved to form the impure nitrate solution, then small amounts of solution
would be heated slowly to evaporate the water. The temperature would be increased to form a calcined plutonium oxide
powder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with other impurities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Alkaline Precipitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As in the case of the direct denitration alternative, this alternative would involve the operation of small scale
equipment which could be installed in two to four existing gloveboxes in the RMC processing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alkaline precipitation process would use alkaline hydroxides or oxalate compounds to precipitate plutonium
from solution. The precipitate would then be filtered and thermally oxidized to plutonium oxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Molten Salt Calcination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative would involve the operation of small- to medium-scale equipment which could be installed in two
existing gloveboxes plus a new glovebox in the RMC process area or in another suitable area of the PFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The molten salt calcination process would use a gas-agitated pool of molten sodium carbonate to convert plutonium-bearing
materials to plutonium oxide. The process could stabilize many types of materials including solutions (nitrates,
chlorides, organics) and solids such as inorganic solids and combustibles. Some feeds would have to be pretreated
prior to processing via size reduction or dissolution in various solutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
No Action Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, residues would remain in certain process equipment, gloveboxes, process canyon areas and
ductwork. Cleanout of the facility would not take place and the residual material would not be stabilized or stored.
Vault storage would continue as an ongoing action under this alternative; the materials in the vaults would continue
to be inventoried, repackaged, and stabilized as necessary. Interim actions would be completed, along with basic
safety upgrades. Surveillance and maintenance would continue at present required levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE does not intend to analyze in detail the potential alternative of cleaning out the PFP but not stabilizing the residual
material (i.e., storing the material without stabilization). Such an alternative would present safety concerns,
would not meet the purpose and need for the proposed action, and is therefore unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preliminary Identification of Environmental Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issues listed below have been tentatively identified for analysis in the PFP EIS. This list is presented to facilitate
public comment on the scope of the EIS. It is not intended to be all-inclusive or to predetermine the potential impacts
of any of the alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Potential effects on the public and on-site workers from releases of radioactive and other hazardous materials
during operations and from reasonably postulated accidents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Potential waste from the proposal, including pollution prevention and waste minimization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Potential effects on air and water quality and other environmental consequences of operations and potential
accidents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Potential cumulative effects of operations at the Hanford Site, including relevant impacts from other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable activities at the site; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Potential effects on endangered species, floodplain/wetlands, and archaeological/historical sites; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Radiation exposure to workers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Potential socioeconomic impacts, including environmental justice issues on surrounding communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Unavoidable adverse environmental effects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Short-term uses of the environment versus long-term productivity; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Potential irretrievable and irreversible commitments of resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal and State laws that are of major importance to environmental management activities at Hanford include the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Washington State Hazardous
Waste Management Act, Chapter 70.105 RCW; the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992; and the Clean Air Act. The Atomic
Energy Act requires the management, processing and use of radioactive materials in a manner that protects workers,
public health, and the environment. RCRA and the Washington State Hazardous Waste Management Act establish requirements
for management of hazardous and mixed waste, including generation, treatment, storage, and disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has submitted an air operating permit application to EPA and the permit is expected to be issued in the November
1995 timeframe; the requirements of the existing air quality permits for PFP are expected to encompass all the anticipated
requirements of any new permit.

Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on September 29, 1994, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) tendered
for filing First Revised Sheet No. 4, Original Sheet No. 4A, and Second Revised Sheet No. 6 to its FERC Gas Tariff, Second
Revised Volume No. 1. Great Lakes states these proposed tariff sheets were filed to reflect Great Lakes' compliance
with the Commission's January 26, 1994, orders in Docket Nos. CP92&hyph;595&hyph;000 and CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great Lakes states that the Commission's orders authorized Great Lakes to construct facilities to provide Part 284
blanket transportation service to Rochester Gas and Electronic Company and Sithe/Independence Power Partners,
L.P. Great Lakes explains that the Commission recognized that there would be an additional 12,000 Mcf of capacity
available per day. Great Lakes relates that it conducted an open season which resulted in Mercury Exploration Company
becoming the shipper for that capacity. Great Lakes asserts that the sheets reflect the separately stated incremental
rates set forth in the Commission orders for such services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great Lakes requests that the tariff sheets become effective November 1, 1994. Great Lakes relates that construction
was completed earlier than expected, and the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000 will be
able to be placed into service on November 1, 1994, rather than the originally estimated date of January 1, 1995. Great
Lakes states that this filing has been served on all of its customers and the Public Service Commissions of the states
of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any party desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before October 28, 1 994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL 92463, EPA gives notice of a two-day meeting of the Ecosystems Information
and Assessments Committee of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT
provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues,
and this meeting is being held to discuss the Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee agenda for the coming
year. The Administrator has asked NACEPT to concentrate on ecosystem management and how long-term ecological, economic,
and social needs can be integrated to achieve a place-driven approach to environmental management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee will concentrate on specific information and assessment
issues required to support a successful place-based approach to ecosystem management. These issues will include
discussion of the role of EPA in information access and dissemination to support place-based ecosystems management;
discussion of information technologies available to support place-based ecosystems management; and discussion
of assessments in support of place-based ecosystems management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee, as does NACEPT, comprises a representative cross-section
of EPA's partners and constituents. However, in order to gain additional insights and perspectives from all interested
parties as this committee begins its work, time has been allotted during the meeting for oral comments from the public.
Any member of the public wishing to present oral comments on any of these issues can schedule an appointment by contacting
Joe Sierra at the address and telephone numbers below. Due to time constraints, oral presentations will be strictly
held to five minutes, and slots are limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available time slots will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis to those scheduling a presentation in
advance. Written comments will be accepted at any time prior to, or at, the meeting.

Privacy Act; Proposed Notice of New and/or Revised Systems of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93&hyph;579, 5 U.S.C. 552(e)(11), the Federal Election
Commission is publishing for comment new and revised systems of records that are maintained by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new systems report was filed with the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the Chairman of the
House Committee on Government Operations and the Office of Management and Budget on October 21, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These systems have been revised or proposed as a result of a re-evaluation of the manner in which records are maintained
by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new system of records which has been added is the Inspector General Investigative Files (FEC 12). The authority
under which this system is maintained is 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). See 11 CFR part 1.14. All other
systems have been revised to incorporate administrative changes which have taken place since the last publication
of FEC systems of records in 1984 and 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These new and revised systems should provide improved protection for the privacy and property rights of Commission
employees, applicants for employment and those who deal with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing to exempt new records system FEC 12 from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. A Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking for this purpose is found elsewhere in today's

Activities</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Federal Republic of Germany (Applicant), has applied pursuant
to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's
Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage de novo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 through CB Clearing, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (Company), a futures commission merchant (FCM) registered under the
Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.  1

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), in executing and clearing, clearing without executing, and purchasing and selling through the use of omnibus trading
accounts futures and options on futures on nonfinancial commodities that previously have been approved by the Board.
Applicant also has applied to engage through Company in executing transactions with respect to the following contracts:
Major Market Index options traded on the American Stock Exchange; Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Stock Index options,
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index options, Long-Term Interest Rate options, Short-Term Interest Rate options,
Long-Term U.S. Treasury Index options, and Short-Term U.S. Treasury Index options traded on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange; and Deutsche Mark options, Swiss Franc options, Australian Dollar options, British Pound options, Canadian
Dollar options, European Currency Unit (ECU) options, French Franc options and Japanese Yen options traded on the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to approve this proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities ``can reasonably be expected
to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that
outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Applicant believes that the proposal
would produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains
that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Applicant to offer its customers a broader range of services.
In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration
of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States General Services Administration (GSA) announces its decision, in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality, November 29,
1978, to construct a new United States Courthouse-Federal Building (USCT-FB) in Sacramento, California. The site
is bordered by H Street to the North, I Street to the South, 5th Street to the West, and 6th Street to the east. The purpose
of the new USCT-FB is to relieve overcrowded conditions at the existing court facilities in the City of Sacramento
and to provide space for anticipated future growth. The proposed project is anticipated to be ready for occupancy
in 1997&hyph;98. The existing courthouse facilities are too small to meet the year 2000 and 2020 space requirements.
Additionally, the existing facilities do not meet guidelines for court facilities set forth in the ``U.S. Courts
Design Guide'' (February 1993). Structural restrictions such as obstructing columns and inadequate ceiling heights
prevent the use of full-size courtrooms in the existing facilities. There is not sufficient space in the current courthouse
to accommodate an increase in the number of courtrooms and the configuration of courtrooms to meet the court design
guidelines. In addition, security in and around the building is inadequate.

I. Criteria for Evaluating EIS Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection of an alternative site involves the weighing and balancing of many complex, interrelated and often competing
policy factors. An alternative superior to others in one environmental respect may be otherwise inferior in another.
Several factors were of key importance in evaluating each of the alternatives. These are identified below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The first project criterion is to provide for the expansion of the federal courts in the Sacramento vicinity. Current
facilities housed in the John E. Moss Federal Building-US Courthouse are insufficient. Leasing additional space
to make up for the shortfall at the Moss Building would not be an efficient means of providing court space. Alternative
project sites were therefore examined for their ability to meet existing court needs as well as their suitability
for future expansion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The second project criterion is to promote local government redevelopment goals, which can often be greatly assisted
by the implementation of large projects such as the high-profile federal building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The third project criterion is the minimization of adverse environmental effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The fourth project criterion is attractive location. Some sites are more attractive due to their proximity to public
amenities, the City's Central Business District, and retail areas.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), GSA has considered a range of alternatives to the
preferred alternative that could feasibly attain the basic objectives of the proposed project. In addition to the
preferred alternative, four other alternatives (a reduced intensity alternative, the Lot B alternative, the expansion
alternative and the no action alternative) have been analyzed within the EIS and are representative of a reasonable
range of alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Preferred Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preferred alternative site, which is owned by both the Southern Pacific Railroad and the City of Sacramento, encompasses
approximately 2.50 acres. The site is bounded by H Street to the North, I Street to the South, 5th Street to the West and
6th Street to the East, within the City of Sacramento. The block is currently irregular in shape and must be reconfigured
as a standard city block by realigning and extending 5th and H Streets. The site is a full City block, which provides
the space required to meet both current court facility needs and the projected court needs through the year 2020. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferred site is located within the boundaries of the Merged Downtown Redevelopment Project Area, and is also
within the boundaries of the proposed Railyards Specific Plan. This alternative is consistent with redevelopment
plans for the Railyards area and will provide a catalyst for development in the Railyards. The project site promotes
local land use and redevelopment goals. It is located in proximity to existing and light rail transits system and is
near the path of its planned extension. This location will promote use of a transportation means that is environmentally
superior to single occupancy vehicle. By virtue of its proximity of the County Jail and the Hall of Justice, the location
presents the potential for operational efficiencies that are not present at the other alternatives. The proximity
of these buildings to each other would make the transportation of incarcerated individuals both easier and safer.
Additionally, the preferred alternative is located in proximity to the City's new Central Library, located at 8th
and I Streets, Downtown Plaza, a regional shopping center located between 4th and 7th Streets along K Street and Plaza
Park, located at 8th and I Streets. These locational amenities add to the attraction of the preferred alternative
site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no wetlands on the project site nor is the site within the 100-year floodplain. Sacramento is located within
Seismic Zone 3 on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 as having the highest risk of seismic events and potential severity. No known
active faults or Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zones occur in or adjacent to the City of Sacramento. An Alquist-Priolo
Zone is a designation given by the State Geologist who assures that homes, offices, public buildings, and other structures
for human occupancy are not built on active faults. The designation requires that a geological investigation be conducted
before a local government can approve a development project located within the special study zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Reduced Intensity Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reduced intensity alternative is identical to the preferred alternative except that a wing or annex would not
be constructed. The building constructed under this alternative would remain at approximately 380,100 square through
the year 2020. As new courtrooms are needed by the Eastern District, approximately the top seven floors would be converted
from office space to courtroom space as under the preferred alternative. Under the reduced intensity alternative,
however, the federal workers displaced by this conversion would move into lease quarters in the Sacramento area instead
of being accommodated on site. The reduced intensity alternative is found to be infeasible because it does not provide
for long-term growth of the federal courts. The building proposed under the reduced intensity alternative would
not provide adequate space through the year 2020. In addition, as conversion from office to courtroom space takes
place, federal workers would have to move into leased space or additional space would have to be constructed off-site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Lot B Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, a building similar to that described in the ``Preferred Alternative'' section would be constructed
on the City of Sacramento's Lot B, which is bounded by H Street on the north, I Street on the south, 10th Street on the west
and 11th Street on the east. This site, which is owned by the City of Sacramento is currently used for City employee parking.
Land uses surrounding the two story parking structure include residential and motel uses to the north, City Hall office
buildings to the west, a high rise parking structure with ground level commercial structures to the south, restaurant,
commercial and residential structures to the east, and Plaza Park and the Sacramento Central Library to the southwest.
Like the preferred alternative site, the Lot B site is owned by the City and is of adequate size to meet current and future
court needs. It is also located within the City's Central Business District and is in proximity to light rail, the City's
new library and Plaza Park. The site is not, however, located as conveniently close to the County jail as the preferred
alternative site. The Lot B Alternative is, however, infeasible as the State of California has recently selected
this site for the location of a new State office building and the City has agreed to sell the property to the State. The
Lot B site is, therefore, not available for the Courthouse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Expansion Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The John E. Moss Federal Building is a nine-story federal office building located at 650 Capitol Mall in downtown Sacramento.
Under this project alternative, an annex would be constructed against the south wall of the Moss Building. A parking
lot for federal employees now occupies the proposed annex site. The land uses surrounding the site consist of the City's
Lot A parking garage to the north, high density residential uses (apartments and townhouses) to the south, and State
of California offices to the east and the IBM and Wells Fargo towers to the west. Under this alternative, an approximately
250,000 square foot annex to the existing John E. Moss Federal Building-US Courthouse would be constructed against
the south wall of the Moss Building. The proposed annex would occupy the approximately 20,000 square foot parking
area to the south of the Building. It would house a new district courtroom, a new and a relocated magistrate courtroom,
a jury assembly area, lobbies and corridors, elevators and ancillary facilities. The proposed annex would be 13 floors
in height. Parking for 250 cars would be provided in a subterran two-level parking garage beneath the annex. Approximately
28,000 cubic yards of material would have to be excavated in order to accommodate a parking area of this size. Because
this site could not meet the courts projected space needs over the current planning period, other space would eventually
have to be leased or constructed. The expansion alternative is infeasible because it does not provide adequate space
to meet the court's current or projected needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. No Action Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the no action alternative, the City of Sacramento would retain possession of the proposed site, and no Federal
building would be constructed there, or any other location. The U.S. Court for the Eastern District of California
would either reduce its space needs in the Sacramento area, or accommodate its future growth by some other means. The
projected increase in the federal presence in the Sacramento area is not contingent upon the construction of a Courthouse/Federal
Building. The rate of growth in all categories of federal employees (including judicial and executive branch agencies)
is projected to be the same, regardless of whether the proposed building is constructed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Mitigation Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All practicable means to avoid or minimize impacts to the area are being considered in the development of the project.
GSA received a number of comments and mitigation suggestions from concerned citizens, and interested and responsible
local, state, and Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant impacts were identified and mitigation measures were set forth in the EIS. The mitigation measures proposed
in the EIS that can be implemented were adopted by GSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Air Quality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several potential areas of impact to air quality. Construction activities will exceed the SMAQMD NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and SMAQMD PM10 emission thresholds. This will be significant and unavoidable. The construction management plan
developed for the project will reduce vehicle emission by reducing vehicle idling time and vehicle miles traveled.
Specifically it will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Route construction trips to avoid congested streets. Construction traffic ingress and egress will be controlled
so as to avoid long queues of construction vehicles entering and leaving the site. Vehicles will enter and leave via
the staging area. Appropriate traffic controls will be established on public roadways where project traffic enters
and leaves the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Electrical power for construction activities will be obtained from power poles instead of electrical generators
(when feasible).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Methanol or natural gas will be used for mobile construction equipment instead of diesel (when feasible).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Trucks will not idle for more than two minutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Active portions of the project site will be watered twice daily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Non-toxic soil stabilizers will be applied to graded areas to be inactive for 10 days or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Excavation and grading will be suspended when the wind speed (as instantaneous gusts) exceeds 25 miles per hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Trucks carrying earth material off-site will be covered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Paved streets adjacent to the construction site will be swept as needed to remove dust and silt that may have accumulated
as a result of construction activities, and all construction requiring heavy equipment will be curtailed during
second stage smog alerts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitigation Measures are feasible and required, but the impact is unavoidable. The primary source of construction-related
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are gasoline and diesel-powered heavy duty mobile construction equipment. The above mitigation measures
will reduce the short-term significant impact of construction activities by restricting use of mobile construction
equipment such that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ROC and CO concentrations from Project construction are minimized. These measures, however, will only partially
reduce the impact. The impact remains significant and unavoidable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project's direct and indirect emissions are less than the de minimis thresholds, as defined in Section 176 of the
1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. Therefore, the subject project is exempt from the final conformity rule and a
conformity determination need to be prepared. The information has been provided to the regional office of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Noise
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of this alternative would expose surrounding land uses to short-term noise levels in excess of City
threshold levels. This impact is considered significant and unavoidable. Site preparation and construction activities
shall comply with the City of Sacramento Noise Ordinance limiting construction activities to the hours between 7
a.m. and 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Saturday as a maximum. All construction equipment fixed
or mobile shall be in proper operating condition and fitted with standard silencing features. Prior to construction
activities, a solid wood construction barrier will be erected around the exterior perimeter of the project sites
to minimize noise intrusion into surrounding residential land uses. An outside construction manager will ensure
that all noise mitigation measures are implemented. In addition, the construction manager will handle any complaints
regarding noise that may arise as a result of construction. The mitigation measure will reduce, but not entirely eliminate,
construction noise impacts resulting from the project. The impact remains significant and unavoidable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Archaeological and Historical
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The implementation of the preferred alternative will have an impact on archaeological and historic resources. The
American Railway Express Building is a building which has been determined eligible, by consensus, for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places. A portion of the structure which is the loading dock has been removed by
the City after the concurrence of the State Historic Preservation Officer and Advisory Council. This is considered
a significant unavoidable impact. The loading dock structure was recorded through mapping, photography, textual
description, and drawings along with a narrative description and history of the structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitigation has GSA consulting with the State Historic Preservation Officer to seek ways to avoid or reduce the effect
on historic properties. In addition, GSA will cooperate to the extent feasible, in plans to preserve the historic
structure which would be affected by the proposed project. The mitigation measure is feasible and will reduce impacts
to historical resources through recordation. However, impacts to the physical structure through demolition cannot
be reduced to a less-than-significant level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potential impact is the scale and style of the proposed courthouse may not be compatible with the surrounding
historically significant structures. This is considered a significant unavoidable impact. By using the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a resource document, the project will employ project design standards which make thorough use of existing historic
context. The project design standards for new construction will consider the existing historic context in determining:
mass, size, scale, materials, texture, setback, and architectural features. The mitigation measure is feasible
and will partially reduce compatibility impacts, but not to a less-than-significant level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Health and Human Services has been rapidly improving its information resources and grant activities
to incorporate total quality management and electronic technologies. As part of this process, HHS is piloting an
on-line grant information service that will serve the general public, grantee organizations, and government grant-making
agencies. This new service, GrantsNet, is a free public-access computer network for finding and exchanging information
about HHS and other Federal grant programs. Anyone having a personal computer with internet capability will be able
to access GrantsNet. Conceptually, GrantsNet has two components: (1) An on-line informational reference service
using gopher server technology; and (2) an interactive mailing list service which groups subscribers with common
interests into computer-managed mailing lists for sharing of information and dialogue on certain subjects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This mission of GrantsNet is to serve as a vehicle and catalyst for continuous improvement and innovation in Federal
grants management practices, policies, and information dissemination. It will provide a medium for the sharing
of ideas, successes, news, lessons learned, and an archival reference library of grant-related legislation, regulations,
and policies. GrantsNet will also provide a yellow-page style directory of granting offices, grants management
staff and grant program personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major thrust of GrantsNet is to allow members of the public to cut through government red tape_to find the information
they want, when they want it, and whom to directly contact for additional information. As such, it is one of the 11 NETworks
created under the auspices of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review (NPR). The aims of the NETworks are
to provide government-wide information and resources in an on-line, easily accessible, and meaningful manner.

When Will It Be Implemented?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HHS has established a gopher and world wide web (WWW) server to facilitate the GrantsNet mission and vision, assisted
by the Parklawn Computer Center which provides selected communication services. The Department is taking a phased
approach to the implementation of GrantsNet. It is anticipated that GrantsNet will be up and running by the end of October
1994, with fiscal year 1995 serving as the pilot-testing period for populating the gopher information service with
grant resource data pertinent to HHS and further developing the interactive mailing list service. Once success of
the system has been established and tested, HHS intends to expand the scope of GrantsNet to governmentwide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development and implementation of GrantsNet are carried out by the GrantsNet Core Team which is managed and directed
by the Office of Grants and Acquisition Management in the Office of the Secretary. The Chair of the GrantsNet Core Team
is Suzanne Neill. Also, as a complement to the Core Team, HHS intends to establish an Advisory Team comprised of individuals
from other Federal agencies. By doing so, interagency collaboration and insights to shaping the development of GrantsNet
will be gained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, HHS recognizes that for GrantsNet to become a practical and user-friendly information service to the Federal
grantee community and to the general public, coordination with interested parties and feedback from users will be
important. To that end, the GrantsNet Core Team is interested in any questions or suggestions you may have. This includes
recommendations for improving GrantsNet services, as well as the identification of additional grants information,
resources, and/or activities that you would like HHS to post. Please address your comments to the GrantsNet Core Team
Chair.

The Advisory Committee Information Hotline can be accessed by dialing 1&hyph;800&hyph;741&hyph;8138 or 301&hyph;443&hyph;0572.
Each advisory committee is assigned a 5-digit number. This 5-digit number will appear in each individual notice of
meeting. The hotline will enable the public to obtain information about a particular advisory committee by using
the committee's 5-digit number. Information in the hotline is preliminary and may change before a meeting is actually
held. The hotline will be updated when such changes are made. The following is a list of each advisory committee's 5-digit
number to be used when accessing the hotline:

The hotline will provide the most recent information available on upcoming advisory committee meetings, guidance
for making an oral presentation during the open public hearing portion, and procedures on obtaining copies of transcripts
of advisory committee meetings. Because the hotline will communicate the most current information available about
any particular advisory committee meeting, the establishment of this system will provide interested parties with
timely and equal access to such information. The hotline should also conserve agency resources by reducing the current
volume of inquires individual FDA offices and employees must handle concerning advisory committee schedules and
procedures.

that are both serious and unexpected; (2) within 15 working days any significant increase in the frequency of a serious,
but expected, adverse experience and any significant increase in frequency of therapeutic failures; and (3) periodically
all other adverse experiences and product distribution and disposition data. This notice is to announce the availability
of a guideline based on the draft guideline made available in 1990. The guideline offers guidance for meeting the reporting
requirements of 21 CFR 600.80 and 600.81 and for meeting the vaccines adverse experience reporting requirements
in accordance with section 2125 of the Public Health Service Act as amended by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury
Act of 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines was prepared by the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Office of Establishment Licensing
and Product Surveillance, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA. In developing the guideline, consideration
was given to the comments received on the proposed rule and on the draft guideline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes from the draft guideline are generally editorial in nature or made to conform to amendments made in the final
rule discussed elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The guideline has also been formatted to be more consistent with the similar guideline, ``Guideline for Postmarketing
Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences,'' applicable to reporting adverse experiences associated with human drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is also issuing a proposed rule that would revise and update the reporting requirements for adverse experiences
related to both biological products and human drugs. When FDA issues the final rule based on that proposed rule, FDA
will also issue a notice of availability of revised guidelines relating to biological products and human drugs to
be consistent with the final rule. Comments received in response to the proposed rule will be considered for the next
revision of the guidelines applicable to biological products and human drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines provide general information to persons dealing with FDA and do not include decisions or advice on particular
situations. A person may follow a guideline or may follow different procedures or practices. When different procedures
or practices are chosen, a person may, but is not required to, discuss the matter in advance with FDA to prevent the expenditure
of money and effort on an activity that may later be determined to be unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A guideline represents the position of FDA on a procedure or practice at the time of its issuance. However, a guideline
does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person. FDA
may, at its discretion, recommend or initiate legal or administrative action against a person or product with respect
to an action taken in conformity with a guideline provided that the legal or administrative action is consistent with
applicable statutes and regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
These comments will be considered in determining whether additional revision of the guideline is appropriate. Two
copies of any comments are to be submitted, except individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with
the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received comments may be seen
in the Dockets Management Branch, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

 PSA +D. The device is a two-site chemiluminometric assay and is indicated for the quantitative, serial determination
of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in serum and to aid in the management of patients with prostate cancer using the
Ciba Corning Automated Chemiluminescence System (ACS). In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(2)) as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not referred to the
Immunology Devices Panel, an FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA
substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On September 2, 1994, CDRH approved the
application by a letter to the applicant from the Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section
515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application.
A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and
procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts.
A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under &sect;10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner
shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the
petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for
resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny
the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

. The Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee will discuss trade secret and/or confidential commercial information
relevant to pending investigational new drug applications. This portion of the meeting will be closed to permit discussion
of this information (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.

Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI&hyph;35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A&hyph;16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

Strategic Directions for the National AETC Program for FY 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1987, the National AETC Program was initially designed to provide information on the prevalence of AIDS and identification
of groups at increased risk of HIV infection. In the second project period which began in 1991, emphasis was placed
on providing training of health care professionals in the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of HIV infection.
Currently, HRSA funds 17 AETCs. As of June 1994, over 400,000 health professionals had received training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1995, the National AETC Program will focus the majority of resources on those Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMAs)
with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS; however, consideration will be given to AETCs in rural areas. The AETCs will
be required to spend the majority of their funds on information dissemination and the training (especially clinical
training) of primary care health professionals, including physicians, registered nurses, dentists, physician
assistants, nurses with advanced training (e.g., nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and nurse midwives)
and dental hygienists. Additionally, the AETCs will focus on mental health providers and allied health personnel.
Emphasis will be placed on training in Ryan White CARE ACT programs and health professional schools and academic health
centers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $16,287,000 will be available in FY 1995 for this program. It is anticipated that approximately 10
to 15 new awards will be made ranging from $500,000 to $2,500,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The focus in FY 1995 will be on primary care providers in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas, with an emphasis on living
persons infected with HIV. However, consideration will be given to rural areas. The project requirements are designed
to direct Federal resources where the greatest needs exist. To accomplish this, each project must define a geographic
region and identify the types of providers to be targeted for training within that region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definition of AETCs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applicants are encouraged to form AETCs composed of as many states/territories/commonwealths as can be managed
completely and efficiently. There are four options for defining an AETC region. An applicant may propose, with appropriate
documentation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. An AETC composed only of a single state/territory/ commonwealth as a region if that region contains two or more Ryan
White CARE Act Title I Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMAs) or if the AETC currently is established as a single state
AETC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. An AETC composed of multiple, contiguous states (Hawaii and Alaska may be included) if it justifies its boundaries
with the inclusion of one EMA and specific local epidemiological data equivalent to at least 10,000 living HIV-infected
persons (with a prevalence of at least 2,500 living AIDS cases and 7,500 other HIV infected persons). Supporting documentation
may include rates of HIV/AIDS infection, or proxy indicators such as STD, TB, and substance abuse, CDC heel stick study
data, teenage pregnancy etc.; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. An AETC for rural regions if it encompasses at least three states with contiguous boundaries (Hawaii and Alaska
may be included) and contains at least one EMA, although the prevalence of living HIV infected persons totals less
than 10,000; or

Part H, Chapter HN (National Institutes of Health) of the Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations
of Authority for the Department of Health and Human Services (40 FR 22859, May 27, 1975, as amended most recently at
59 FR 42066, August 16, 1994) is amended to reflect the reorganization of the National Institute of Dental Research
(NIDR) (HNP). This reorganization will align NIDR's organizational structure with that of other Institutes to assure
proper comparability and recognition of organizations and positions by both the dental community and personnel
of other Government organizations. The reorganization consists of the following: (1) Realign the Office of Administrative
Management (HNP13) and Office of Planning, Evaluation and Communications (HNP14) in the Office of the Director (HNP1);
(2) establish the Division of Intramural Research (HNP2); (3) transfer the functions of the Intramural Research
Program (IRP) (HNP&hyph;2) to the Division of Intramural Research and abolish the IRP; (4) establish the Division
of Extramural Research (HNP4); (5) transfer the functions of the Extramural Program (EP) (HNP&hyph;4) to the Division
of Extramural Research and abolish the EP; (6) establish the Division of Epidemiology and Oral Disease Prevention
(HNP5); and (7) transfer the functions of the Epidemiology and Oral Disease Prevention Program (EODPP) (HNP&hyph;5)
to the Division of Epidemiology and Oral Disease Prevention and abolish the EODPP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposes to establish a new system of records: 09&hyph;25&hyph;0169, ``Medical
Staff Credentials Files, HHS/NIH/CC.'' This system of records will be used by NIH staff to: (1) Maintain information
used in the credentialing and privileging of active medical staff members at the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center;
(2) document patient care privileges for active members of the medical staff; (3) provide information about active
and non-active members of the medical staff to authorized individuals; and (4) report to the National Practitioner
Data Bank as required by the provisions of Title IV of Public Law 99&hyph;660, as amended.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The system will comprise records that contain medical staff names, date of birth, home address and telephone number,
office address and telephone number, citizenship, visa information, appointment date, hospital-wide computer
access privileges, Institute/Center/Division designation, branch/lab, type of medical staff membership, privilege
delineation, professional degree(s) including school of attendance and graduation dates, foreign medical examinations,
specialty board certifications, licensing information (including state of licensure and license number), record
or disciplinary actions, documentation of training, and admitting privileges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of information recorded on each individual will be only that which is necessary to accomplish the purposes
of the system. Records are established from forms and documentation submitted by individual medical staff members
to the Medical Record Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The records in this system will be maintained in a secure manner compatible with their content and use. NIH and Contractor
staff will be required to adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the HHS Privacy Act regulations. The System
Manager will control access to the data. Only authorized users whose official duties require the use of such information
will have regular access to the records in this system. Authorized users are HHS employees and Contractor staff responsible
for implementing the medical staff credentials data system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records will be stored on paper forms in file folders and on computer disk. Manual and computerized records will be
maintained in accordance with the standards of Chapter 45&hyph;13 of the HHS General Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding
Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45&hyph;13, the Department's Automated
Information System Security Program Handbook, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data stored in computers is accessed through a network system by use of a password known only to authorized users. Rooms
where records are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours, rooms are unlocked by entry is controlled
by on-site personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The routine uses proposed for this system are compatible with the stated purposes of the system. The first routine
use permitting disclosure to a congressional office is proposed to allow subject individuals to obtain assistance
from their representatives in Congress, should they so desire. Such disclosure would be made only pursuant to a request
of the individual. The second routine use of this system allows disclosure to the Department of Justice to defend the
Federal Government, the Department, or employees of the Department in the event of litigation. The third routine
use allows referral to the appropriate agency in the event that a system of records maintained by this agency to carry
out its functions indicates a violation or potential violation of law. The fourth routine use allows disclosure of
records to contractors for the purpose of processing or refining records in the system. The fifth routine use permits
disclosure to representatives of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations for the purpose
of conducting quality assurance reviews and inspections of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center credentialing
policies and procedures. The sixth routine use permits disclosure to State medical boards for purposes of professional
quality assurance activities. The seventh routine use allows disclosure to health care facilities for the purpose
of verifying that an individual to whom they intend to grant medical staff or patient care privileges has or previously
held such privileges at the Warren G. Magnuson Clincial Center.

when data from original records are encoded for analysis. Data stored in computers is accessed through a network system
by use of a password known only to authorized users. All authorized users of personal information in connection with
the performance of their jobs (see Authorized Users, above) protect information from public view and from unauthorized
personnel entering an unsupervised office. These practices are in compliance with the standards of Chapter 45&hyph;13
of the HHS General Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary
Chapter PHS hf: 45&hyph;13, and the Department's Automated Information System Security Program Handbook, and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS
Pub. 31).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)), we are notifying the public of our intent to establish
two new systems of records. The proposed systems are entitled ``SSA-Initiated Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate
Statement (SIPEBES) History File, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0224'' and ``SSA-Initiated Personal Earnings
and Benefit Estimate Statement Address System for Certain Territories, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0225.''
For convenience we will refer to these systems as the ``History File'' and the ``Territory Address System,'' respectively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are also proposing to establish routine uses of the information to be maintained in the two systems. The proposed
routine uses are discussed below.

We filed a report of the proposed systems of records with the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the House Committee
on Government Operations, and the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
on October 3, 1994. The proposed systems, including the proposed routine uses, will become effective as proposed,
without further notice, on November 12, 1994, unless we receive comments on or before that date which would warrant
preventing the systems from taking effect.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Description of the Proposed Systems of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1143(c) of the Social Security Act requires SSA to phase in a program, beginning not later than October 1, 1999,
for mailing a PEBES annually to everyone:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Who has reached at least age 25,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Who has had some earnings reported to his/her Social Security number (SSN),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Who is not receiving benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For whom SSA can determine a mailing address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The phasing in requires SSA to furnish PEBES by not later than September 30, 1995, to everyone who has reached age 60
by October 1, 1994, who is currently not receiving title II benefits, for whom some earnings have been reported, and
for whom a current mailing address can be established; and from October 1, 1994, to September 30, 1999, to everyone
who attains age 60 during that period and who meets the other criteria for receiving the PEBES. The PEBES will be sent
in the fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) in which the individual attains age 60.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two systems together will enable SSA to mail Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statements (PEBES) to certain
individuals, pursuant to section 1143 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&hyph;13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA has previously maintained current address information only for those persons currently entitled to monthly
Social Security benefits. Therefore, SSA must obtain address information for everyone to whom SSA will be required
to mail a PEBES.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, SSA will use different sources for obtaining the address information that will be maintained
in the systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
History File. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For persons living within a State of the United States or the District of Columbia, SSA will use address information
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), reflecting addresses taken from Federal income tax returns. SSA
will maintain this address information obtained from IRS in the History File.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the PEBES have been released in a given mailing cycle, SSA will inevitably receive inquiries from some individuals
about their PEBES, or alleging that they did not receive a PEBES. The History File will enable SSA to verify whether
a PEBES was released to that person, when, to what address, and what address source was used. The History File will also
permit statistical studies involving the PEBES system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Territory Address System. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For persons living in Puerto Rico or in a territory of the United States who are not required to file Federal income tax
returns, SSA must obtain their addresses from sources other than the IRS. SSA will obtain this information from the
Commonwealth and Territorial governments. SSA must maintain these data until needed for a PEBES mailing. We therefore
are establishing the Territory Address System of records for that purpose. After an address is identified from the
Territory Address System and a PEBES is mailed, the address information will be maintained in the History File.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Collection and Maintenance of Data in the Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information for the History File (each individual's address information, other personal information, and information
about the PEBES mailing) will be obtained from IRS and from sources within SSA, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information for the Territory Address System will be obtained primarily from the Commonwealth and Territorial governments,
possibly supplemented from other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Proposed Routine Use Disclosures of Data in the Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are proposing to establish the following routine use disclosures of the information that will be maintained in
the two systems. The routine use disclosures are identical for both systems except as noted. Information may be disclosed
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information may be disclosed to contractors and other Federal agencies, as necessary, to assist SSA in the efficient
administration of its programs. We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only in situations
in which SSA may enter a contractual or similar agreement with a third party to assist in accomplishing an agency function
relating to this system of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contractors will safeguard information disclosed to them consistent with the requirements of the Privacy Act.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only when SSA enters into a contractual or similar agreement
with a third party to help SSA maintain the proposed systems or to carry out the PEBES mailing program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In administering our program, we often find that it is more efficient to use an outside contractor to carry out some
of our functions. This proposed routine use would allow us to disclose information from the system under these circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Information may be disclosed to a congressional office in response to an inquiry from the congressional office
made at the request of the subject of the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 6103)
will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only in situations in which the individual asks his/her
Member of Congress to intercede in an SSA matter on his/her behalf. Information will be disclosed from the proposed
systems only when the Member of Congress inquires and presents evidence that he/she is acting on behalf of the individual
whose record is requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Information may be disclosed to the Department of Justice (DOJ), a court, or other tribunal, or another party before
such tribunal, when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SSA, or any component thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) any SSA employee in his/her official capacity; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) any SSA employee in his/her individual capacity when DOJ (or SSA, when it is authorized to do so) has agreed to represent
the employee; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) the United States or any agency thereof when SSA determines that the litigation is likely to affect the operations
of SSA or any of its components, Is a party to litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and SSA determines that
the use of such records by DOJ, the court or other tribunal, or other party before the tribunal is relevant and necessary
to the litigation, provided, however, that in each case SSA determines that such disclosure is compatible with the
purposes for which the records were collected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed routine use would permit us to disclose information from the proposed systems when an SSA component
and/or employee is involved in litigation involving information in the proposed system. The routine use would also
permit disclosure when SSA brings suit or when another party bring suit and SSA has an interest in the litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Information may be disclosed to the Office of the President for responding to an individual pursuant to an inquiry
received from that individual or from a third party on his or her behalf.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use in situations in which that individual or someone else
on the individual's behalf asks the President to intercede in an SSA matter pertaining to the individual. Information
may be disclosed from the proposed systems when the Office of the President inquires and presents evidence that it
is acting on behalf of the individual whose record is requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Nontax return information, the disclosure of which is not expressly restricted by Federal law, may be disclosed
to the General Services Administration and the National Archives and Records Administration under 44 U.S.C. 2904
and 2906, as amended by the National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984, for the use of those agencies
in conducting records management studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Archivist of the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) are charged by 44 U.S.C. 2904 with promulgating safeguards, procedures, and guidelines regarding
records management and conducting records management studies. Section 2906 of that law, also amended by the NARA
Act of 1984, provides that GSA and NARA are to have access to Federal agencies' records and that agencies are to cooperate
with GSA and NARA. In carrying out these responsibilities, it may be necessary for GSA and NARA to have access to these
two proposed systems of records. In such instances, the routine use will facilitate disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Information may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for auditing SSA's compliance with the safeguard
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This routine use applied only to the History File which maintains some information obtained from the IRS. As necessary,
the routine use will allow disclosure to IRS to ensure that SSA is in compliance with safeguard standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
IV. Compatibility of the Proposed Routine Uses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Both the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7) and (b)(3)) and our disclosure regulations (20 CFR part 401) permit
us to disclose information under a routine use for a purpose which is compatible with the purposes for which we collected
the information. Paragraph 401.310(c) of the regulations permits us to disclose information under a routine use
to administer our programs. Section 401.205 of the regulations requires us to disclose information when a law specifically
requires the disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed routine uses numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, described above, will facilitate SSA's administration of its
programs. Routine use number 5 will allow GSA or NARA to inspect our records, as required by 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906,
when those agencies conduct records management studies. Thus, all the routine uses are appropriate and meet the criteria
in the Privacy Act and SSA's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
V. Safeguards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
We will employ a number of security measures to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal
data in the two proposed systems. These measures include the use of passwords and access codes to enter the computer
system which will maintain the data, and storage of the computerized records in secured areas which are accessible
only to employees who require the information in performing their official duties. SSA employees who have access
to the data will be informed of the criminal penalties of the Privacy Act for unauthorized access to or disclosure of
information maintained in the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, any contract which SSA may sign with a third party in order to carry out the required mailings will stipulate
that (a) the contractor must establish safeguards to protect the personal information temporarily in its custody,
in accordance with Privacy Act requirements; (b) the contractor may use the information only as necessary in fulfilling
the contract; and (c) the contractor is subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act.

VI. Effect of the Proposed Systems of Records on Individual Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As discussed above, the proposed systems of records will enable SSA to mail PEBES. Recipients will benefit from the
PEBES because these statements will help them plan their finances and check the accuracy of SSA's records. The routine
uses will benefit individuals by helping SSA run its programs smoothly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will adhere to all provisions of the Privacy Act, Social Security Act, and other applicable laws in our maintenance
and use of the information. Thus, we do not anticipate that the system will have any adverse effect on individuals'
rights.

Safeguards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Safeguards for automated records have been established in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) Information Resources Management Manual, Part 6, Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook.
This includes maintaining the magnetic tapes and discs within an enclosure attended by security guards. Anyone entering
or leaving this enclosure must have a special badge issued only to authorized personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For computerized records electronically transmitted between Central Office and Field Office locations (including
organizations administering SSA programs under contractual agreements), safeguards include a lock/unlock password
system, exclusive use of leased telephone lines, a terminal-oriented transaction matrix, and an audit trail. All
microfilm and paper files are accessible only by authorized personnel who have a need for the information in performing
their official duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA's terminals are equipped with physical key locks. The terminals are also fitted with adapters to permit the future
installation of data encryption devices and devices to permit the identification of terminal users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contractors will safeguard information disclosed to them consistent with the requirements of the Privacy Act.

SSA retains correspondence one year when it concerns documents returned to an individual, denials of confidential
information, release of confidential information to an authorized third party, and undeliverable material; for
four years when it concerns information and evidence pertaining to coverage, wage, and self-employment determinations
or when it affects future claims development, especially coverage, wage, and self-employment determinations.
Correspondence is destroyed, when appropriate, by shredding. Magnetic media records are maintained indefinitely.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 30, 1994 (59 FR 50148), the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, a Supplemental Notice for GNMA Multiclass Securities Program, in which it referred to a Notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27290), which implemented a new program under which GNMA would guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed
securities. The May 26, 1994 Notice provided for implementation in two stages, the initial stage and the full participation
stage. The program is intended to benefit borrowers using federally insured or guaranteed mortgages by increasing
investment demand for GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'') that are backed by these mortgages,
thus reducing financing costs for these mortgages; and raise revenues through the receipt of guarantee and other
fees by GNMA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The September 30, 1994 Notice and a Notice of Proposed Information Collection Requirements to OMB, published on September
28, 1994 (59 FR 49410), identified that this program under which GNMA would guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed
securities, contained information collection requirements, but that no person would be subjected to a penalty for
failure to comply with these information collection requirements until they had been approved and assigned an OMB
control number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this document is to announce the OMB control number for the GNMA Multiclass Securities Program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the provisions of Public Law 97&hyph;451, a petition for reinstatement of Oil and Gas Lease TXNM 89085, Sabine
County, Texas, was timely filed and was accompanied by all required rentals and royalties accruing from June 1, 1994,
the date of the termination. No valid lease has been issued affecting the land. The lessee has agreed to new lease terms
for rentals and royalties at rates of $10.00 per acre, or fraction thereof, and 162/3 percent, respectively. Payment
of a $500.00 administrative fee has been made. Having met all the requirements for reinstatement of the lease as set
in Section 31(d) and (e) of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 188(d) and (e)), the Bureau of Land
Management is proposing to reinstate the lease effective June 1, 1994, subject to the original terms and conditions
of the lease and the increased rental and royalty rates cited above, and the reimbursement for cost of publication
of this Notice.

Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE): Announcement of Opportunity for Science/Education
Teams. POC Contact Technical Representative: Barrett Rock, 202&hyph;395&hyph;7600. The Government is interested
in receiving proposals that address the development of services and materials to support scientific measurements,
environmental education, teacher training, and program evaluation as part of the GLOBE Program. The GLOBE Program
is an international education and science program that will involve students all over the Earth in measuring their
local environment and creating a global set of data to be shared via the Internet that will be used to create global environmental
images for the students and by environmental scientists. GLOBE is driven in part by the measurement needs of scientists
and will be structured to teach students about the Earth's environment, thereby generating increased interest in
science and awareness of the changing global environment. A public briefing will be held from 10:00 to 12:00 on November
3, 1994, in the Auditorium of the Department of Commerce, which is entered on 14th St. between Constitution Ave. and
E St. in Washington, DC. Organizations planning to attend should provide a list of attendees, limit two per organization,
to John Schmidt, 202&hyph;395&hyph;7600, FAX 202&hyph;395&hyph;7611. The Program Announcement, which contains
a detailed description of the competition, will be released on or about October 28, 1994; deadline for receipt of proposals
is December 15, 1994. Any award is subject to availability of funds. Proposals will be evaluated by a peer review panel,
which will meet in January, 1995. Written requests for copies of the announcement should be directed to Dr. Barrett
Rock. The GLOBE Program, 744 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503. For information on how to obtain the Program
Announcement electronically from the National Science Foundation, contact:

Baltimore Gas and Electric Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, General Criterion 2, ``Design Bases For Protection Against Natural Phenomena,'' to
Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located
at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption would allow relief from General Design Criterion 2 (GDC&hyph;2) during the upgrading of the
Unit 2 emergency diesel generator (EDG) No. 21. The proposed exemption will permit the temporary removal of a steel
missile door which provides missile protection for the No. 21 EDG, which will be out-of-service to allow for modifications
which will increase its load capacity, and also provides missile protection to portions of the support systems for
EDGs Nos. 11 and 12. EDGs Nos. 11 and 12 are required to be operable to support the operation of Unit 1 (Modes 1, 2, or 3).
In addition, EDG No. 12 is a swing EDG and is required to be operable for Unit 2 when the unit is shutdown or in refueling
(Mode 5 or 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The upgrading of the Unit 2 EDG will be performed during the upcoming Unit 2 refueling outage (RFO&hyph;10). RFO&hyph;10
is scheduled to commence on March 17, 1995, and be completed in late May 1995. The steel missile door will be required
to be removed about four times during the outage. The licensee estimates that each of the removals will last for about
24 hours, which will result in a total removal time of about 100 hours during the scheduled 65 day RFO&hyph;10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed temporary exemption is needed to permit the completion of highly desirable upgrade to the Unit 2 EDG No.
21 without requiring a dual unit shutdown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption does not involve any measurable environmental impact during normal operation of Unit 1 or
the shutdown/refueling of Unit 2 since the plant configuration is changed only minimally for short periods of time
when the missile door will be removed and overall plant operation is not changed. The likelihood of tornado-generated
or other high wind-generated missile damage during the time the exemption would be in effect and which could affect
equipment required to be operable to avoid radiological impact is low. Also, the licensee indicates that the missile
door will be reinstalled whenever severe weather conditions arise. Thus, the proposed temporary exemption would
not significantly affect the probability or consequences of potential reactor accidents and would not otherwise
affect radiological plant effluents. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves features located entirely within
the owner-controlled area defined in 10 CFR Part 20. The EDG upgrade project activities do not affect nonradiological
plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the staff concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal alternative to requesting the temporary exemption for implementation of the EDG upgrade would be to
comply with the restrictive requirements of GDC&hyph;2. However, this alternative would not significantly enhance
the protection of the environment, and would result in a significant loss of power generation since a dual outage would
be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternate Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the April 1973 Final Environmental
Statements for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted the State of Maryland, Department of Natural Resources, regarding the environmental impact
of this proposed action. The State of Maryland had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment and has determined, therefore, not to prepare and environmental impact
statement for the proposed exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 27, 1994, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') pursuant to Section 11Aa3&hyph;2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed amendment to its National Market System Plan for the purpose of establishing a Data Control Service Agreement
and a Control Service Fee for persons other than vendors who provide a data control service to OPRA subscribers and
exempting subscribers who receive the feed from OPRA's Subscriber Indirect Access Fee. On August 30, 1994, OPRA filed
with the Commission a letter amendment revising the amendment to clarify that OPRA vendors who provide data control
services to their data feed customers are not considered to be Control Service Providers required to enter into a Data
Control Service Agreement or pay a Control Service Fee.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed amendment was published for comment in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recent developments in computer and communications technology have led an increasing number of OPRA subscribers
to receive options information by means of high speed, data feed transmissions from vendors. Historically, OPRA
vendors have provided a controlled and formatted transmission of options information to most subscribers, but have
also provided an uncontrolled, bulk, data feed transmission to an increasing number of subscribers. As a result of
the trend toward data feed transmission, a new type of service provider_the data control service provider_has appeared.
Such a provider controls the access and entitlement of subscribers' devices in respect of market information received
in the form of a data feed transmission. Unlike vendors, data control service providers are not currently subject
to a contract with OPRA nor are they required to contribute toward OPRA's overall administrative costs, despite the
fact that, like vendors, they are in the business of redistributing options information.

II. Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment establishes a Control Service Fee to be paid by persons other than vendors who provide a data
control service to OPRA subscribers. The monthly fee of $2,800 is the same as that currently paid by vendors under their
agreement with OPRA. The control service fee is intended to cover OPRA's additional administrative costs and to allocate
a portion of OPRA's overall costs to those persons who utilize options market information for commercial purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The proposed amendment also establishes a Data Control Service Agreement that will serve as a contract between a Control
Service Provider and OPRA. This agreement imposes requirements on Control Service Providers intended to assure
the reliability and integrity of the services they provide. It will require Control Service Providers to provide
OPRA with a complete description of the systems and procedures to be utilized by them in controlling subscribers'
access to options information, as well as a current list of subscribers and their entitlements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The amendment also provides that OPRA's Subscriber Indirect Access Fee, which is payable by subscribers who receive
uncontrolled data feed transmissions of options information from vendors, will not apply to subscribers whose receipt
of a data feed transmission is under the control of a Control Service Provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Finally, the Indirect (Vendor Pass-Through) Circuit Connection Rider to OPRA's Subscriber Agreement would be amended
to relieve controlled data feed subscribers of the obligation to report device counts to OPRA. Since vendors and Control
Service Providers are or will be required to provide this information to OPRA, there is no need to obtain it from the
subscribers.

III. Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the Commission received one comment letter.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Reuters, a vendor that distributes OPRA information, assumed that the purpose of the amendment was to replace the
indirect access fee (paid by subscribers who receive an uncontrolled data feed of information from vendors) with
a charge to vendors who control the data delivered to a subscriber. As the letter amendment (cited on page 2 of this order)
makes clear, only data control service providers 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
who are not vendors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be required to enter into a Data Control Service Agreement and pay the Control Service Fee. No new or additional
fees are to be imposed on vendors under this amendment.

IV. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes the proposed amendment is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to OPRA and, in particular, with Sections 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) and (D) of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii)
provides for the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and
transactions in securities. Section 11A(a)(1)(D) provides for the linking of all markets for qualified securities
through communications and data processing facilities to foster efficiency, enhance competition, increase the
information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the offsetting of investor's orders, and
contribute to the best execution of such orders. Further, the Commission believes that the amendment is consistent
with Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(2) in that it is appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Data Control Service Provider Agreement and accompanying fee will help OPRA to assure the reliability and
integrity of the service that these providers offer OPRA customers. The Agreement will permit OPRA to know the exact
number of entitlements a subscriber has arranged for with the Control Service Provider. This will eliminate the need
for the Indirect Access Fee, currently paid by those subscribers who receive an uncontrolled data feed whether they
have one entitlement or 100. The Control Service Fee, payable by the Provider, will be the same as the fee charged to
vendors, thus promoting uniformity and equality in pricing options information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3)(B) of the Act, that the amendments to the OPRA Plan be, and hereby
are, approved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange is designating Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts as eligible, pursuant to Exchange Rule 154,

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exchange Rules 131 and 154 allow stop and stop limit orders
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 in selected derivative securities to be elected by a quotation,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 provided the prior approval of a Floor Official is obtained. Absent this provision, such orders could only be elected
when a transaction in the security occurred at or through the stop price, notwithstanding the fact that the quoted
market had moved through the stop price as a result of trading in the underlying security.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Stop sell orders generally are entered in a stock whose price has increased substantially to protect the investor's
profits should the stock price decline. Similarly, stop buy orders generally are entered by investors with short
positions to limit losses should the stock price increase.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A stop or stop limit order in a derivative security is elected, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
becomes a market or limit order, respectively, when the quoted market for the derivative security reaches the appropriate
stop or stop limit price. Once elected, the specialist treats the orders like any other market or limit order. The specialist
must execute the market order at the next best market price, and must execute the limit order at the limit price or hold
the order on his limit order book until the limit price is available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Exchange Rule 154, Commentary .04(c)(v), provisions regarding the election of stop and stop limit orders are
only applicable to such derivative securities as are designated by the Exchange as eligible for this treatment. Currently,
only index warrants have been so designated.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange had previously designated Americus Trust Units, PRIMEs, and SCOREs as eligible as well, but all such
securities have since expired and are no longer traded.

Accordingly, the Exchange now designates, pursuant to Exchange Rule 154, Commentary .04(c), Standard &amp; Poor's
Depositary Receipts
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 as eligible for stop and stop limit orders to be elected by quotation. These derivative equity securities can be expected
to fluctuate in price based on changes in an underlying stock index, and are therefore appropriately designated as
eligible for election of stop and stop limit orders by quotation.

2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning,
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Exchange and therefore has become effective pursuant to
Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the

that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

The PER system provides member firms with the means to electronically transmit equity orders up to volume limits specified
by the Exchange directly to the specialist's post on the Exchange Floor. Market and marketable limit orders and preopening
market orders are placed on the specialist's electronic book. Once the PER order is executed, the system transmits
the execution report directly back to the member firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the PER system accepts (1) up to 5,099 shares for all eligible market and limit orders; (2) up to 25,000 shares
for eligible market and limit orders for Unit Investment Trust securities (such as Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary
Receipts);
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and (3) up to 30,099 shares for market and limit round lot orders for those securities included in the S&amp;P 500 Index.

to that portion of the current proposed rule change as it relates to Amex securities in the S&amp;P 500 Index) (``Amex
Approval Order'').

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Amex Approval Order, the Commission granted partial accelerated approval for that portion of the instant filing
which pertains to those Exchange-listed equity securities included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. The Commission also
stated in the Amex Approval Order that if, after three months, the Exchange wishes to extend the PER parameters to all
other Exchange-listed equity securities, then it has the option to do so. During the three-month pilot the Exchange
has had an opportunity to observe the level of increased utilization of PER and factor that into its assessment of how
best to implement the parameter increase for the remainder of the Exchange-listed equity securities. The Exchange

The Exchange now requests an extension of the PER parameters to all other Exchange-listed equity securities.

 letter from Ivonne Nagy, Special Counsel, Amex, to Amy Bilbija, Commission, dated October 18, 1994. The letter confirms
the systems capabilities and the Amex's intention, upon Commission approval, to extend the increased order size
that may be routed through PER to all other Exchange-listed equity securities to take effect on November 1st.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the Amex's proposal to increase the PER share parameters, from 5,099 to 30,099, for orders
of the remaining Exchange-listed equity securities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 equity securities in addition to those included in the S&amp;P 500 Index), is consistent with the requirements of
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the
Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 because it will facilitate transactions in securities by allowing for the timely transmission of a larger number
of orders to the Amex floor. The proposal will also result in more efficient and effective market operations, consistent
with Section 11A(a)(1)(B) and will further the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the efficient execution
of securities transactions consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act.

have adequate computer processing capacity to accommodate the increased order size eligibility.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission notes, however, that if the Exchange does not implement the expansion to all Exchange-listed equity
securities within six months of the approval date of this order, then it cannot so implement without demonstrating
to the Commission that the systems capacity remains adequate to facilitate the additional order flow.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule filing is to amend the Exchange's fee schedule in order to capitalize on the competitive
niches that the Exchange currently enjoys and to improve the Exchange's competitive position. The proposal would
provide a $.25 per trade credit on all non-self-directed, electronically routed, Exchange executed, trades of any
size. For purposes of the per trade credit, ``non-self-directed'' shall mean entered by a BEACON subscriber in stocks
in which the routing firm has no affiliation with or financial interest in the specialist operation registered in
those stocks. The aggregate credit per firm shall be limited to the total monthly layoff transaction fees charged
to that firm.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1993, NSCC has been redesigning its bond comparison system to accelerate the processing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
submission and comparison) of bond transactions to achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in
the comparison process.3 NSCC believes accelerated processing will help to increase certainty and reduce risk in
the clearance and settlement of debt transactions. The first phase of the redesign process enhanced the processing
of transactions in municipal securities and was implemented by NSCC on August 13, 1993.4
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of the current proposed rule change is to expand the accelerated comparison system to include
the processing of transactions in corporate bonds and unit investment trusts (``UITs''). The proposed rule change
also permits NSCC to provide comparison services for baby bonds (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, corporate bonds having a par value of less than $1,000) and new issue trading. The proposed rule change also modifies
the fee structure for correction fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule change, the cutoff time for submission of original trade input for all corporate bond and UIT
transactions is moved from 1:00 p.m. on the day following trade date (``T+1'') to 2:00 a.m. on T+1. These trades will
be reported back to members by 8:00 a.m. on T+1. Adjustments to original trade input will have to be made prior to the
time specified by NSCC on T+1, which will be 6:00 p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NSCC will accept trade input for trade-for-trade processing of corporate baby bonds. If transactions
are submitted as a mixed lot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
submissions including baby bonds and round lots), the baby bond and the round lot portions of the transaction will
be separated by NSCC upon input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the option of members, corporate bond and UIT transactions will be compared when the net buy side and sell side aggregate
principal amounts can be matched for a particular security, even if the relevant principal amounts are specified
in more than one buy side and/or more than one sell side submission, if the transactions would have been compared had
such buy side and sell side principal amounts each been specified on a single submission.

Because correction processing occurs at the New York and American Stock Exchanges and at the National Association
of Securities Dealers before the trade input is transmitted to NSCC, Add-by-Seller, Delete-by-Seller, Delete Add-by-Seller,
and Delete-by-Buyer instructions will no longer be accepted under the proposed rule.

NSCC will provide comparison services for corporate bond new issue transactions on the same basic terms and conditions
as it currently provided for municipal securities transactions with the exception of syndicate takedown processing.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Original trade input for new issue corporate bond transactions will be accepted until the third day prior to the initial
settlement date for the issue. Original input may set forth either (1) a final settlement price and a settlement date
that is either the initial settlement date or a specified number of days after the initial settlement date or (2) a dollar
price. Original trade input that is submitted between three and five days prior to the initial settlement date but
does not set forth a final settlement price and settlement date or does not set forth a dollar price will be treated as
regular way input. Any corporate bond new issue transactions that remain uncompared at the opening of business on
the day prior to the initial settlement date will be deleted from NSCC's system.

This means that it may not be possible to process some new issue transactions through the entire range of available
trade resolution procedures prior to being dropped. In the extreme case, new issue submissions made on the second
day prior to the initial settlement date that do not compare will be dropped without any opportunity for resolution.
These unresolved trades will be reported on a separate unresolved trade report, and any trade dropped without the
opportunity for resolution may be resubmitted after the initial settlement date.

In addition, NSCC's fee structure relating to correction fees is being amended to reflect that correction capabilities
are being accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. These fee changes conform all bond correction
fees to the fees implemented in connection with municipal securities transaction processing in that participants
will be charged for supplemental input on or after T+1.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, NSCC charges participants for supplemental input relating to corporate bond and UIT transactions on
or after T+2. In addition, the bond system correction fees for ``don't know'' and ``questioned trade'' input is being
deleted because NSCC no longer processes such transactions. The proposed rule change also makes certain conforming
changes and deletions to NSCC's Procedures in order to reflect greater uniformity in NSCC's bond comparison system
and to eliminate certain language which has become obsolete.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F).
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Section 17A(b)(3)(A) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the proposed changes to NSCC's comparison
procedures should help achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in the comparison process and thus
help increase certainty and reduce risk in the clearance and settlement of corporate bond and UIT transactions. Use
of NSCC's bond comparison system should significantly improve the comparison rate for corporate bonds, baby bonds,
and unit investment trusts and should facilitate moving from a five business day settlement cycle to a three business
day settlement cycle.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, the Commission believes that by expanding the bond comparison system to include corporate bond, baby bond,
and new issue transaction processing, NSCC is aiding in the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions.

On October 6, 1993, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1 under the Act, which establishes three business days
after the trade date instead of five business days as the standard settlement timeframe for most broker-dealer transactions.
The rule becomes effective June 1, 1995. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 6, 1993), 58 FR 52891 (release

NSCC's fee structure will be amended with regard to correction fees to reflect that correction capabilities will
be accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. The Commission believes that these changes to NSCC's
fee structure are appropriate and in conformity with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act which requires the rules of a
clearing agency to provide for equitable allocation of reasonable fees among its participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing so that NSCC can begin utilizing the new comparison procedures
for trades executed on October 21, 1994. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule change
because accelerated approval will allow NSCC to implement the new procedures as scheduled. Additionally, the Commission
does not anticipate that it will receive any significant negative comment on the proposed rule change in view of the
fact that no comments have been received to date by the Commission or NSCC.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act,
particularly with Sections 17A(b)(3)(F) and 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;16)
be, and hereby is, approved.

Applicant's Representations and Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Chase requests exemptive relief for itself, any management investment company registered under the Act, other
than an investment company registered under section 7(d) of the Act (a ``U.S. Investment Company''), and any custodian
for a U.S. Investment Company from section 17(f) of the Act. The requested exemption would let Chase, such U.S. Investment
Company and such custodian to maintain foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents (collectively, ``Assets'')
in the custody of Chase-Malaysia, an indirect subsidiary of Chase located in Malaysia. For purposes of the application,
the term ``foreign securities'' includes (a) securities issued and sold primarily outside the United States by a
foreign government, a national of any foreign country, or a corporation or other organization incorporated or organized
under the laws of any foreign country, and (b) securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of the United States
or by any state or any political subdivision thereof or by any agency thereof by any entity organized under the laws
of the United States or of any state thereof which have been issued and sold primarily outside the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(f) of the Act requires every registered management investment company to place and maintain its securities
and similar investments in the custody of certain enumerated entities. Rules 17f&hyph;5 under the Act expands the
group of entities located outside the United States that are permitted to serve as custodians for the Assets of registered
management investment companies. Rule 17f&hyph;5 defines the term ``Eligible Foreign Custodian'' to include a
majority-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of a qualified U.S. bank or bank-holding company that is incorporated
or organized under the laws of a country other than the United States and that has shareholders' equity in excess of
$100,000,000 (U.S. $ equivalent or U.S. $) as of the close of its most recently completed fiscal year. The rule defines
the term ``Qualified U.S. Bank'' to include a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States that
has an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profit of not less than $500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Chase is a national banking association and is regulated as such by the Comptroller of the Currency under the National
Bank Act. At December 31, 1993, Chase had shareholders' equity in excess of $6.4 billion. Thus, Chase is a ``Qualified
U.S. Bank'' under the requirements of Rule 17f&hyph;5, since it is a banking institution organized under the laws
of the United States, and it has aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profit substantially in excess of the $500,000
minimum required by the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Chase is a subsidiary of The Chase Manhattan Corporation, a Delaware company that provides financial services
throughout the world. Through its Global Securities Services division (``GSS''), Chase provides custody and related
services to global institutional investors, including U.S. mutual funds. GSS currently has over $1,300 trillion
in assets under custody at various locations throughout the world, including its branches and subsidiaries in approximately
50 countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Chase established a branch in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1964, and currently offers custody services in Malaysia
through that branch. However, under the Malaysian Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989, Chase must now convert
its branch to a locally incorporated entity. To comply with Malaysian law, Chase proposes to transfer all the activities
of the branch, as well as its personnel, to Chase-Malaysia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Chase-Malaysia will be wholly-owned by Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corporation, a wholly-owned direct
subsidiary of Chase. Chase-Malaysia will assume the assets, liabilities, and business of the Chase Kuala Lumpur
branch and will be subject to the supervision of Bank Negara Malayasia (the central bank of Malaysia). Chase-Malaysia
will offer the same services as the former Chase Kuala Lumpur branch, and will become subject to the same capital and
reporting requirements as other domestic banks in Malaysia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Chase-Malaysia will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5 insofar as it will be a majority-owned indirect
subsidiary of Chase and will be incorporated and organized under the laws of Malaysia. Chase-Malaysia will not, however,
meet the $100 million minimum shareholder's equity requirement of rule 17f&hyph;5. Accordingly, Chase-Malaysia
will not qualify as an ``Eligible Foreign Custodian'' under the rule and, absent exemptive relief, could not serve
as custodian for the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Where custody services are required in Malaysia, Chase will hold the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies as custodian
or subcustodian, and will deposit (or cause or permit the deposit of) the Assets with Chase-Malaysia in accordance
with the arrangement described in the conditions below. Chase-Malaysia will be well-qualified to provide custody
and subcustody services to Chase, U.S. Investment Companies, and custodians for U.S. Investment Companies, since
Chase-Malaysia will be the successor to the business of Chase's Kuala Lumpur branch, which is experienced in providing
custody services. Under the proposed foreign custody arrangements, the protection affforded the Assets of U.S.
Investment Companies held by Chase-Malaysia would not be diminished from the protection afforded by rule 17f&hyph;5.

Chase agrees that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief may be conditioned upon the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The foreign custody arrangements proposed regarding Chase-Malaysia will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5
in all respects other than Chase-Malaysia's level of shareholders' equity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Chase will deposit Assets with Chase-Malaysia only in accordance with the Custody Agreement and the Subcustody
Agreement described in (a) and (b) below. The Custody and Subcustody Agreements will remain in effect at all times
during which Chase-Malaysia fails to satisfy all the requirements of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Custody Agreement will be between Chase and the U.S. Investment Company (or its custodian). In that agreement,
Chase will undertake to provide custody or subcustody services, and the U.S. Investment Company (or its custodian)
will authorize Chase to delegate to Chase-Malaysia such of Chase's duties and obligations as will be necessary to
permit Chase-Malaysia to hold the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies in custody in Malaysia. The Custody Agreement
will further provide that the delegation by Chase to Chase-Malaysia will not relieve Chase of any responsibility
to the U.S. Investment Company or its custodian for any loss due to such delegation, and that Chase will be liable for
any loss or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by Chase-Malaysia of the custody services to
the same extent as if Chase had itself provided the custody services under the Custody Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A Subcustody Agreement will be executed by Chase and Chase-Malaysia. Pursuant to this agreement, Chase will delegate
to Chase-Malaysia such of Chase's duties and obligations as would be necessary to permit Chase-Malaysia to hold Assets
in custody in Malaysia. The Subcustody Agreement will explicitly provide that (i) Chase-Malaysia is acting as a foreign
custodian for Assets that belong to a U.S. Investment Company pursuant to the terms of an exemptive order issued by
the SEC and (ii) the U.S. Investment Company or its custodian (as the case may be) that has entered into a Custody Agreement
will be entitled to enforce the terms of the Subcustody Agreement and can seek relief directly against Chase-Malaysia.
The Subcustody Agreement will provide that it will be governed by New York law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In June 1992, the United States signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Pursuant
to the reporting requirements under Articles 4.2 and 12 of the Convention, the United States has prepared and submitted
the U.S. Climate Action Report (USCAR) in fulfillment of these requirements to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The USCAR
provides a description of the current U.S. program designed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The
information presented in the USCAR, together with information provided by other Annex I Parties (developed country
Parties and Parties with economies in transition to market economies), will be reviewed and discussed by the Parties
to the UNFCCC beginning at the first session of the Conference of the Parties in early 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with international guidelines, the USCAR provides an inventory of current U.S. greenhouse gas emissions
and sinks, estimates effects of current mitigation measures and policies on future emissions levels, and describes
U.S. involvement in international programs including associated financial transfers and contributions. In addition,
the USCAR includes a discussion of U.S. national circumstances which affect its vulnerability and responses to climate
change. Information on adaptation programs and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the largest climate change
research program in the world, is also presented. While it briefly discusses the future direction of the U.S. effort,
the USCAR does not seek to identify policies or measures additional to those described in the Climate Action Plan,
announced by President Clinton and Vice President Gore on October 19, 1993, that might ultimately be taken as the United
States continues to move forward in addressing climate change.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In June 1992, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the ``Earth Summit''), the United
States signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of this
Convention is to: ``Achieve *&blank;*&blank;* stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be
achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that
food productions is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been predicted that human produced greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide)
will cause change in global average climate at a rate that could far exceed any natural change that has occurred in the
last 10,000 years. Although there are uncertainties regarding the magnitude, timing and regional patterns of global
climate change, any human-induced change that does occur is not likely to be reversed for decades_or even centuries_because
of the long lifetimes of the greenhouse gases and the inertia of the climatic system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the UNFCCC's reporting requirements as specified in Articles 4.2 and 12, the United States has
prepared the U.S. Climate Action Report (USCAR) and submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The USCAR represents
the United States' first formal communication to the Secretariat under these Articles.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USCAR provides a background to the issue of global climate change and describes current U.S. efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Following the Introduction and Overview (chapter 1), the
report begins (in chapter 2) with an analysis of United States national circumstances which affect its vulnerability
and responses to climate change. These circumstances include natural resources, the economy, energy production
and consumption, governing institutions, and U.S. policies related to climate change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next chapter (chapter 3) consists of an inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous oxide, and HFC and PFC emissions. Because the full U.S. submission includes a copy of the EPA Report
``Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks for 1990&hyph;1993'', the USCAR itself provides a summary
of this complete inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 4 deals with the specific actions being taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This section is drawn from
the material contained in the 1993 U.S. Climate Change Action Plan. As with the emissions inventory, a detailed supplement
was also submitted to the INC Secretariat on this material. That document, ``The Climate Change Action Plan: Technical
Supplement,'' has been published separately by the Department of Energy. The 1993 Action Plan aims to limit greenhouse
gas emissions while continuing to guide the U.S. economy toward environmentally sound economic growth into the next
century. The Plan is comprehensive, as it targets all greenhouse gases and all sectors of the economy through a portfolio
of nearly fifty different actions. It is designed for rapid implementation by building on existing technologies,
programs, and voluntary efforts to deliver cost-effective results. It is a coordinated federal response, involving
several government agencies working together, and was developed through an interagency process. The Plan is being
actively monitored to ensure that it meets the President's goals, and will be modified to adapt to changing circumstances.
Finally, the Plan lays the foundation for an international response to climate change through the United States Initiative
on Joint Implementation.

The combined effect of the U.S. actions, assuming 1993 economic predictions and full funding of all mitigation measures,
would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1,459 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) by the year 2000,
slightly below the 1990 level of 1,462 MMTCE. Without these mitigation policies, projected net greenhouse gas emissions
would rise to 1,674 MMTCE. Since these policies were first developed and their effects projected, economic growth
has been more robust, and oil prices lower than predicted in the Action Plan. These differences and other effects on
meeting the projected emission reductions of the Plan are now being evaluated.

Chapter 5 of the USCAR examines the potential impacts of global climate change as well as strategies to adapt to any
such change. Both adverse and beneficial consequences of climate change are plausible, with the overall effect depending
on the rate and magnitude of change and the vulnerability or sensitivity of human and natural systems to such changes.
Possible consequences include rising sea levels, coastal zone erosion, shifts in precipitation patterns (causing
either more floods or droughts), shifts in agricultural production, and increased stress on forest ecosystems.

Chapter 6 highlights current U.S. research and public education efforts regarding climate change. The U.S. Global
Change Research Program, the largest climate change research program in the world, seeks both to expand knowledge
about the processes that affect climate change and to develop integrated models to predict these effects. In addition
to basic science research, the U.S. is promoting research in all economic sectors_including industry, transportation,
housing, and agriculture_to develop strategies to reduce emissions. The United States is coordinating its research
efforts with both international organizations and on a bilateral basis with individual countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the public has a solid understanding of the science of climate change and the consequences of policy
options, the U.S. is also continuing to develop its efforts to coordinate general education, communication, and
information programs for the public. Educational outreach programs include GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations
to Benefit the Environment) for K&hyph;12 students, and Project Earthlink, a long-term effort targeting community
leaders, informal educators, teachers, students, journalists, and the general public.

International activities and cooperation regarding global climate change are discussed in Chapter 7. The Climate
Convention requires all Parties to communicate a national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks and describe
measures taken to implement the convention. To help developing countries meet this commitment, the U.S. initiated
its Country Studies program in 1992. This program is providing technical and financial support to developing countries
and countries with economies in transition to help them prepare studies to address climate change. Chapter 7 also
highlights other ways in which the United States is implementing its financial commitments under the Convention,
including numerous U.S. bilateral mitigation projects as well as multilateral cooperation through such organizations
as the Global Environment Facility, multilateral development banks, the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development, the International Energy Agency, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization.

The final chapter of the Climate Action Report addresses future actions to address climate change. In this chapter,
two important issues are raised: (1) the uncertainties in projecting the effectiveness of current actions to meet
the U.S. domestic commitment to return greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000, and (2) the long-term
actions that must be taken to address global warming_as greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise beyond the
turn of the millenium.

The U.S. Climate Action Report was prepared in a broad interagency process, incorporating_to the greatest extent
possible_data from all relevant sectors and programs. Preliminary versions of the Report were circulated to nongovernmental
organizations, including environmental and business groups, for their review and comment. Where possible, suggestions
received were incorporated into this text.

The Framework Convention on Climate Change requires that Parties periodically prepare additional communications
on their actions to address climate change. It is the U.S. intention to collect comments received on this first submission
and on the basis of those comments_and additional actions being taken within the government_to prepare additional
documents for submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, while the timing for subsequent submissions has not been determined, written comments on the U.S.
Climate Action Report are invited. Comments should be submitted to the Department of State no later than December
30, 1994. Comments or questions should be directed to: Mr. Daniel A. Reifsnyder, Director, Office of Global Change,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), will prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct the southern section of Loop 49, an approximately 40 mile circumferential
controlled access highway around the urbanized area of Tyler in Smith County, Texas. The southern section of the proposed
Loop 49 extends from State Highway 155 to State Highway 110 in southern Smith County. The length of the project varies,
depending on the selected alternative, from approximately 15.3 kilometers (9.5 miles) to 18.5 kilometers (11.5
miles). The proposed action is intended to provide access and increased mobility to the southern Tyler/Smith County
area; to alleviate traffic congestion on existing roadways in urbanized Smith County; and to provide a safer, more
convenient route for traffic travelling through the Tyler area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the proposed action to be discussed in the EIS consist of (1) taking no action; and (2) improving existing
roadways in the urbanized areas of Smith County. The build alternatives include three alternative alignments along
new location rights-of-way connecting State Highway 155 to State Highway 110.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impacts caused by the construction and operation of Loop 49 will vary according to the alternative alignments utilized.
Generally, impacts would include the following: transportation impacts (construction detours, construction
traffic, and mobility improvement), air and noise impacts from construction equipment and operation of the roadway,
water impacts from construction area and roadway stormwater runoff, impacts to waters of the United States including
wetlands from right-of-way encroachment, and impacts to residents and businesses based on potential relocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed interest in the proposal. A Major
Investment Study has been completed in compliance with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. In
addition, several meetings have been held by the Loop 49 Steering Committee, composed of representatives of local
governments, agencies, and interested organizations and citizens. A public meeting was held on October 13, 1994,
at Robert E. Lee High School in Tyler, Texas, at which public comments on the proposed action and alternatives were
requested. In addition, a public hearing will be held after publication of the Draft EIS. Public notice will be given
of the time and place of the hearing. The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to
the public hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or TxDOT at the addresses provided above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118(a) (formerly section 152(a) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1412(a)), Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a has made an initial decision that
model year 1973&hyph;1991 full-sized GM pickup trucks and cab-chassis equipped with fuel tanks mounted outboard
of the frame rails contain a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rationale for this initial decision is set forth in the Engineering Analysis (EA) Report for EA92&hyph;041. The
entire report, as well as the complete record on which the initial decision is based, are available for inspection
during working hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) in NHTSA's Technical Reference Library, Room 5108, 400 Seventh Street,
SW, Washington, DC 20590. That record consists of the public files for EA92&hyph;041 and Defect Petition (DP) 92&hyph;016.
The Executive Summary of the EA Report is set out below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Engineering Analysis was opened on December 8, 1992, as a result of granting a petition from the Center for Auto
Safety (CAS) and Public Citizen to ``initiate a defect investigation into and recall all Chevrolet/GMC full-sized
pickups (C/K-series) with fuel tank(s) *&blank;*&blank;* mounted outboard of frame rails.'' The objective of the
investigation was to determine whether certain model year 1970&hyph;1991 Chevrolet and GMC full-sized pickup trucks
contain a defect that poses an unreasonable risk to safety, related to the danger of fires following crashes, with
primary focus on side-impact crashes. In the investigation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
(NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) conducted analyses of real-world accident data and performed laboratory
crash tests of the subject and peer vehicles. ODI also addressed questions related to the compliance of these trucks
with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 301, ``Fuel System Integrity.'' Additionally, ODI examined
whether the fuel tanks and related components on the trucks were unduly affected by corrosion that could make them
more likely to be involved in a fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 9, 1993, ODI sent a recall request letter to General Motors Corporation (GM), recommending that GM conduct
a safety recall on GM trucks with fuel tanks mounted outside the frame rails (subject vehicles). That letter was based
on two principal factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Real-world accident data in the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) indicate that there is an increased risk
of fatality caused by fire in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to 1973&hyph;1987 Ford
full-sized pickup trucks. That increased risk led to an estimate that, in 1993, an additional 5&hyph;6 fatalities
would occur in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to what would occur if those trucks had
the same side-impact fire performance as full-sized Ford pickups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Laboratory crash tests corroborated the findings from the real-world accident data analysis. That is, in certain
comparable side-impact crash tests, GM fuel tanks leaked and Ford tanks did not. Further, these tests used instrumented
test dummies. Dummy measurements indicate that humans could have survived the crash forces at the impact speeds at
which the subject vehicles leaked. While these speeds are well in excess of the impact speed specified in FMVSS No.
301, the results indicate the increased fire risk in the GM trucks in crashes that are otherwise survivable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM provided an extensive amount of data and arguments in response to the recall request letter. ODI has completed an
exhaustive review and analysis of the GM submissions and has conducted a variety of additional analyses associated
with issues involved in this investigation. These include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An assessment of the effect of corrosion on fuel tank leakage and fire performance in the subject vehicles;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An analysis of non-fatal burn injuries in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An in-depth review of all available police accident reports and other records of side-impact, fire-involved
fatal crashes involving the subject vehicles to assess the crash conditions and severity of each; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An update of the FARS analysis that led to the April 9, 1993 recall request letter; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An analysis of the reasonableness of GM's decision to design the subject vehicle with side-mounted fuel-tanks,
given what GM knew about the safety risks associated with that design and the availability of feasible alternative
designs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An analysis of the information about the risk of post-crash fuel leaks that became available to GM during the
time the subject vehicles were being manufactured.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Principal Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;A review of GM submissions, as well as ODI testing, indicates that there are no data on which to conclude that
the GM trucks to which FMVSS No. 301 applied, when new, did not comply with the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There are no data to indicate a relationship between fuel tank corrosion and increased fire risk in the subject
vehicles, either in side impacts or in non-crash incidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Apart from the basic decision to locate the fuel tanks of the subject vehicles outside of the frame rails, many
of the specific features of the design of the fuel storage system and the surrounding area have increased the likelihood
of post-crash fuel fires in the subject vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Based on a review of 1979&hyph;1993 accident data reflecting the performance of full-sized pickups in side-impact
fatal crashes involving fire, occupants of the subject vehicles experienced 2.8 times as many fire-related fatalities
(i.e., fatalities in crashes in which a fire occurred) per million registered vehicle-years as occupants of Ford
pickups and 2.5 times as many as occupants of Dodge pickups. Where the FARS code indicated that the most harmful event
(MHE) of the crash was fire, the GM-to-Ford occupant fatality per million registered vehicle-years ratio is 3.4 to
1, and the GM-to-Dodge ratio is 6.1 to 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Real-world accidents data do not support GM's contention that GM and Ford pickup trucks have comparable side-impact
fire performance and that differences in driver demographics and driver behavior explain the difference in the rates
of fire-related and MHE-fire fatalities in side-impact crashes for the GM and Ford pickups. This is demonstrated
by the tremendous reduction in the rate of MHE-fire side-impact fatalities that occurred after GM moved the fuel tanks
for these pickups inside the frame rails in model year 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Contrary to GM's contentions, the MHE coding in FARS is a reliable indicator of the number of fatalities actually
caused by fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;FARS data indicate that, if past trends continue, there would be approximately five additional fatalities
due to fire in side-impact crashes in 1994 compared to what would occur if the subject vehicles had the same side-impact
fire performance as Ford full-sized pickups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reports of non-fatal burn injuries indicate that, if past trends continue, there would be three to four additional
non-fatal burn injuries in 1994 in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to the Ford pickups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Laboratory crash data indicate that, at certain impact speeds and configurations, the subject vehicles will
leak fuel in side impacts, while comparable Ford pickups will not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;While the crash severities in fatal side-impact, fire-involved crashes involving the subject vehicles are
far in excess of the severity specified in FMVSS No. 301, they are generally less than the severities that result in
fires in fatal side-impact crashes involving the Ford pickups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;GM was aware at the time it designed the subject vehicles in the early 1970s that side-mounted fuel tank design
presented an increased risk of post-crash fuel fed fires in side impacts, compared to the risk associated with other
feasible alternative designs. Moreover, GM obtained additional information demonstrating the increased risk
associated with the side-mounted tanks during the 15-year period the subject vehicles were in production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Principal Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The increased risk of death and injury from fire in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles is a
result of the design of their fuel storage system, primarily the location of the fuel tanks outside of the frame rails,
supplemented by other features of the design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Given the state of the art at the time and GM's awareness of the likely consequences, it was unreasonable for
GM to design the subject vehicles with fuel tanks outside the frame rails.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The increased safety risk due to post-crash fires in the subject vehicles is unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, on the basis of the entire investigative record, I have initially decided, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118(a)
(formerly section 152(a) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act), that the subject vehicles contain
a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Citizen Exchanges, Division of the NIS Secondary School Initiative, of the United States Information
Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award to conduct
exchanges through the multiple secondary school linkage program with select countries of the NIS. The countries
are Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Public or private non-profit organizations meeting
the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply either to enhance/expand existing linkages or to
develop new school linkage programs. Both models are described in the guidelines section of this solicitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicants may submit a proposal for only one of the two models
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. All submissions must contain an Educator (teacher and/or administrator) exchange component AND a Student exchange
component. Approximately one third of the grants awarded will be to promote the development of new linkages. Organizations
asking for USIA funding for previously established linkages must demonstrate the value of the linkages to the NIS
Secondary School Initiative program as well as show evidence that the linkage is designed to outlast USIA funding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overall funding and grant making authority for this program is contained in the Freedom Support Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;391).
These exchanges represent part of the activities for the NIS Secondary School Initiative and are subject to the availability
of funding for the Fiscal Year 1995 program. Proposals for programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements
and guidelines outlined in the Solicitation Package.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity''should
be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, ethnicity,
religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are stongly encouraged
to adhere to the advancement of this principle.

Overview:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this program is to link a network of U.S. secondary schools with a network of schools in one or more NIS
countries to serve as the basis for exchanges of Educators and Students during the academic year. The USIA's main objective
is to foster interaction between American and foreign participants. Proposals should demonstrate how participants
will interact in a way which encourages the exchange of ideas and promotes mutual understanding in both the short-
and long-term. The linkages between networks of secondary schools in the U.S. with networks of schools in the NIS must
occur through at least three main program components: (1) the Exchange of secondary school educators between the
U.S. and participating NIS countries; (2) the exchange of secondary school students, and 14 to 17 years of age, between
the U.S. and participating NIS countries; and, (3) the establishment of institution-building ties between the schools
in the networks.

Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: This solicitation is for two separate models of multiple secondary school linkages between networks of schools.
Applicants must submit a proposal for only one of the two models. The proposal should state clearly which model is being
used. In both models, each network, one in the U.S. and one in the NIS, should consist of a minimum of three schools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is designed to enhance and expand existing linkages between a network of U.S. secondary schools and a network of secondary
schools in one or more of the countries listed above. USIA funding may not be used to supplant existing private sector
funding. Applicants must indicate how activities have been funded in the past and how the activities will be expanded
with assistance from USIA. The U.S. recipient of the grant is responsible for recruiting/selecting/organizing
a minimum of three U.S. secondary schools to form the U.S. network, strengthening an existing working relationship
with an organization or agency of government in the NIS responsible for a network of schools there, and linking the
two networks through three main components of the program: Educator exchange, Student exchange, and Institution-building
links.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model B 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is designed to encourage the development of new links whereby the U.S. network that does not have existing links to
secondary schools in the NIS will be matched with an NIS network chosen by USIA. Proposals must rank-order participating
NIS countries where the applicant would like to establish linkages. The U.S. recipient of the grant is responsible
for recruiting/selecting/organizing a network composed of a minimum of three U.S. secondary schools, agreeing
to form partnership with a NIS network selected by USIA, and linking the two networks through three main components
of the program: Educator exchange, Student exchange, and Institution-building links.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some special cases, applicants who are involved in existing linkage activity may request that USIA select new schools
and networks in the NIS for a proposed expanded linkage. In this case, the applicant should rank-order the preferred
countries to be considered for linkage. Depending on availability of suitable matches, USIA will select the NIS network
or school and inform applicant of the match.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both Model A and Model B, the U.S. recipient of the grant will: Design the overall plan which integrates the three
components of the linkage, manage all travel arrangements, logistics, passports, visas, etc., provide competent
and informed escorts for student groups, and distribute and account for grant funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals must address other essential operations of the program including the incorporation of a feasible plan
to establish communication (through computer linkages and other forms of correspondence) and the formation of a
solid working relationship between the partner schools before the student groups arrive in the host country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recipients of the assistance award are responsible for ensuring the selection of exchange participants who are suitable
for the program. Participants (both Educators and Students) from the U.S. and the NIS countries should represent
a broad array of backgrounds to give greater understanding to the culture and society as a whole. Selection of individual
participants from the U.S. and the NIS in the exchange components of the program must be merit based; the proposal should
describe the mechanisms used for participant selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Partnerships should have an existence beyond the scope of this initiative; that is, there should be an inherent reason
for their linkage apart from the availability of grant funds. Competitive proposals demonstrate this linkage and
the types of activities (follow-on) that will continue after the grant has expired.

Instructions for Part IV_Program Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program narrative will comprise the largest portion of your application. This part is where you spell out the who,
what, when, where, why, and how of your proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although you will not have a form to fill out for your narrative, there is a format. This format is the selection criteria.
Because your application will be reviewed and rated by a review panel on the basis of the selection criteria, your narrative
should follow the order and format of the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before preparing your application, you should carefully read the legislation and regulations of the program, eligibility
requirements, information on any priority set by the Secretary, and the selection criteria for this competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your program narrative should be clear, concise, and to the point. Begin the narrative with a one page abstract or summary
of your proposed project. Then describe the project in detail, addressing each selection criterion in order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary strongly suggests that the applicant limit the program narrative to no more than 40 double-spaced,
typed pages (on one side only), although the Secretary will consider applications of greater length. Be sure to number
consecutively ALL pages in your application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You may include supporting documentation as appendices. Be sure that this material is concise and pertinent to this
program competition and is numbered consecutively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants are advised that: (a) The Department considers only information contained in the application in ranking
applications for funding consideration. Letters of support sent separately from the formal application package
are not considered in the review by the technical review panels. (34 CFR 75.217) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The technical review panel evaluates each application solely on the basis of the established technical review
criteria. Letters of support contained in the application will strengthen the application only insofar as they contain
commitments that pertain to the established technical review criteria, such as commitment and resources.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under terms of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, and the regulations implementing that Act, the Department
of Education invites comment on the public reporting burden in this collection of information. Public reporting
burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 90 hours per response, including the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. You may send comments regarding this burden to the U.S. Department of Education, Information
Management and Compliance Division, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4651; and to the Office of Management and Budget,
Paperwork Reduction Project, OMB 1830&hyph;0013, Washington, DC 20503. (Information collection approved under

Appendix B
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. May we use this same application to compete for funds under a different grant program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications
of the grant program to which it is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. I'm not sure which grant program is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that this previous contact is not required,
nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of grant programs with closing dates at about the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local
school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point,
we cannot share information about the review with anyone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Is travel allowed under these projects? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we may request the project director of funded
projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you may also wish to include a trip or two to Washington, D.C.
in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the
dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on
the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What happens during negotiations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are
issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions
may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification
or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion
of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may
provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions
will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification
for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How do I provide an assurance?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Except for SF&hyph;424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' which must be completed, simply state
in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Where can copies of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, a program's regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, most can be obtained from the Government
Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402,
Telephone: (202) 783&hyph;3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the specific
name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice would be referred to as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Public Law 101&hyph;392) 104 Stat. 753 (1990).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The program narrative will comprise the largest portion of your application. This part is where you spell out the who,
what, when, where, why, and how of your proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although you will not have a form to fill out for your narrative, there is a format. This format is the selection criteria.
Because your application will be reviewed and rated by a review panel on the basis of the selection criteria, your narrative
should follow the order and format of the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before preparing your application, you should carefully read the legislation and regulations of the program, eligibility
requirements, information on any priority set by the Secretary, and the selection criteria for this competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your program narrative should be clear, concise, and to the point. Begin the narrative with a one page abstract or summary
of your proposed project. Then describe the project in detail, addressing each selection criterion in order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary strongly suggests that the applicant limit the program narrative to no more than 40 double-spaced,
typed pages (on one side only), although the Secretary will consider applications of greater length. Be sure to number
consecutively ALL pages in your application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You may include supporting documentation as appendices. Be sure that this material is concise and pertinent to this
program competition and is numbered consecutively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants are advised that: (a) The Department considers only information contained in the application in ranking
applications for funding consideration. Letters of support sent separately from the formal application package
are not considered in the review by the technical review panels. (34 CFR 75.217) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The technical review panel evaluates each application solely on the basis of the established technical review
criteria. Letters of support contained in the application will strengthen the application only insofar as they contain
commitments that pertain to the established technical review criteria, such as commitment and resources.

Appendix B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. May we use this same application to compete for funds under a different grant program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications
of the grant program to which it is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. I'm not sure which grant program is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that this previous contact is not required,
nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of grant programs with closing dates at about the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local
school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point,
we cannot share information about the review with anyone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Is travel allowed under these projects? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we may request the project director of funded
projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you may also wish to include a trip or two to Washington, D.C.
in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the
dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on
the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What happens during negotiations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are
issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions
may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification
or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion
of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may
provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions
will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification
for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How do I provide an assurance?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Except for SF&hyph;424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' which must be completed, simply state
in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Where can copies of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, a program's regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, most can be obtained from the Government
Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402,
Telephone: (202) 783&hyph;3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the specific
name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice would be referred to as follows:
