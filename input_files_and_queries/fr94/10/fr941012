<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class E airspace at the Harper Municipal Airport, Harper, Kansas. Prior to the Airspace Reclassification,
the Class E airspace for Harper, Kansas, was designed to exclude that airspace east of 98 degrees longitude. However,
during Airspace Reclassification, the excluded area, including the Bob Park Airport (private), was inadvertently
omitted. The intended effect of this action is to exclude the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude above the
Bob Park Airport (private) located northeast of Harper, Kansas. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts
to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class
E airspace at the Harper Municipal Airport, Harper, Kansas (59 FR 4612).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to Airspace Reclassification, the Class E airspace area for Harper, Kansas excluded that airspace east of 98
degrees longitude. During Airspace Reclassification, this excluded area was inadvertently omitted. The NPRM proposed
to exclude that airspace ``north of Hwy 160 and east of longitude 98 00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; W. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments
on the proposal to the FAA. One commenter objected to the proposal because it did not exclude all the airspace east of
98 degrees longitude. The inclusion of the airspace ``north of Hwy 160
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; within the excluded area was in error. This amendment corrects that error in the NPRM by deleting the Class
E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude, which was inadvertently omitted in the airspace reclassification. It has
been determined this exclusion will not compromise safety to aircraft arriving or departing the Harper, Kansas,
Municipal Airport. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above
ground level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16
1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends Class E airspace at Harper, Kansas,
by excluding the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude above the Bob Park airport (private) located northeast
of Harper, Kansas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034: February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to allow bonded carriers to transport merchandise within port limits
without having to obtain a cartman's license. It also amends the regulations to allow the operators of foreign trade
zones, container station and centralized examination stations and the proprietors of bonded warehouses to transport
merchandise from within the district to their respective facilities. These amendments will result in savings of
time and money for both the trade and Customs.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs requires that the carriage of imported merchandise, for which duty has not yet been paid, only be accomplished
by certain bonded carriers. A cartman is one who undertakes to transport goods or merchandise within the limits of
a port. A lighterman is one who transports goods or merchandise on a barge, scow, or other small vessel to or from a vessel
within the port or from place to place within a port. The regulations regarding cartage and lighterage of merchandise
are set forth in Part 125 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 125). The regulations regarding the bonding of carriers
which receive merchandise for transportation in bond, and the licensing of cartmen and lightermen are set forth in
Part 112 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 112). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, pursuant to &sect;&sect;112.2(b) and 112.21, Customs Regulations, Customs requires a bond and a license
to transact business as a cartman or a lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise entered for warehouse,
designated for examination, taken to container stations, or taken into custody as unclaimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 29, 1992, Customs published a Notice of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 49049) proposing to consider within port transfers by cartmen and lightermen like other in-bond movements
and to allow bonded carriers, in most instances, to carry in-bond cargo within a port without requiring them to obtain
cartman or lighterman licenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the document, it was proposed that cartage and lighterage of merchandise designated for examination,
taken to container stations, taken into custody as unclaimed or destined for admission to a foreign trade zone either
may be done under the bond of a licensed cartman or lighterman, or if approved by the district director, under the bond
of a foreign trade zone operator, container station operator, centralized examination station operator, or a bonded
carrier. However, a license would still be necessary to obtain to carry in-bond merchandise within a port for the cartage
of merchandise entered for warehouse; the reason for this exception was that 19 U.S.C. 1565 contained a statutory
requirement that a cartman be licensed for cartage of merchandise entered for warehouse. Customs issued the proposal
because it believes that the elimination of the license requirement will save Customs and the trade time and money.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory Change Since Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182,
107 Stat. 2057). Section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) amended 19 U.S.C. 1565 to allow the cartage of merchandise
entered for warehouse by bonded carriers as well as by licensed cartmen. Accordingly, the statement in the proposal
that a license is required to transact business as a cartman and lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise
entered for warehouse is no longer consistent with the statute. The statutory impediment to allowing the cartage
of merchandise entered for warehouse by bonded carriers that existed at the time the proposal was published no longer
exists.

Analysis of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 19 entities responded to the proposal. Generally, each respondent supported the proposal and stated that,
if adopted, the proposal would eliminate unnecessary and redundant paperwork for both Customs and the trade, would
expedite the movement of cargo within port limits, and would be a positive step in simplifying Customs procedures.
Of the 19 commenters, seven fully supported the measure. The remaining commenters, although generally supportive
of the purpose of the proposed amendments, suggested some changes. Some sought clarification regarding the types
of cartage authorized to be performed by the operators of foreign trade zones, centralized examination stations
and container stations. Specific comments requesting changes and clarifications and Customs responses are set
forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven commenters requested that the measure be expanded to include transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones,
whether within or adjacent to the same port of entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations currently provide that cargo movements carried out outside the port limits but within the district
boundaries may be accomplished by a bonded carrier. This applies to transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones.
The final regulation set forth in this document provides that cargo destined for a foreign trade zone or subzone may
be picked up within the district by the operator of the foreign trade zone or subzone to which it is going. This is specified
by the new language for &sect;112.2(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested a more liberal wording of the proposed language for 19 CFR 112.2. The language for 19 CFR 112.2
reads, in part: ``Cartage *&blank;*&blank;* may be done under the bond of a cartman, *&blank;*&blank;* or, if approved
by the district director, a bonded carrier *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The commenter felt that the proposed language would
still require companies with extensive route systems to submit an application of some sort in every Customs district
where they anticipate performing the cartman function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the future, approval of the bond of a bonded carrier by the district director would indicate approval by Customs
for the bonded carrier to engage in cartage. The rule would permit bonded carriers to transfer merchandise within
port limits without the need for an application or a cartman or lighterman license; therefore, there is no need to further
amend or adopt a more liberal wording of the proposed language in 19 CFR 112.2.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters requested that 19 U.S.C. 1565 be amended to eliminate the requirement for cartmen licenses for cargo
movements into bonded warehouses. They suggested that such an amendment could be accomplished through the Customs
Modernization Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted previously in this document, section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade
Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182) amends 19 U.S.C. 1565 to eliminate the requirement for a cartman's
license for cargo movements into bonded warehouses. Any carrier designated as a carrier of bonded merchandise may
cart merchandise destined for entry into a bonded warehouse. The final regulation has been amended to reflect the
statutory amendment.

One commenter suggested that Customs clarify whether a foreign trade zone operator is only entitled to engage in cartage
for a foreign trade zone, a container station operator only for a container station, a centralized examination station
(CES) operator only for a CES, and a bonded warehouse proprietor only for a bonded warehouse, while a licensed cartman
or bonded carrier would be entitled to engage in cartage for any of those facilities, and whether district directors
would be allowed some discretion in this matter.

Customs agrees that the best policy is that a foreign trade zone operator would be limited to the transportation of
merchandise to his foreign trade zone, a container station operator to his container station, a CES operator to his
CES, and a bonded warehouse proprietor to his bonded warehouse. A licensed cartman or a bonded carrier would be entitled
to engage in transporting merchandise for any of those facilities, the cartman within the port limits and the carrier
within the district boundaries. Language to this effect has been inserted in the new &sect;112.2(b). Once a district
director has approved the respective entity's bond, that entity may engage in transporting merchandise as provided
for in these regulations.

The commenter suggests that the conditions of the custodial bond in 19 CFR 113.63 and the foreign trade zone operators
bond in 19 CFR 113.73 should be revised to conform with the proposed change in 19 CFR 112.2(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113.63, Customs Regulations, has been altered slightly to conform with the changes. Regarding the foreign
trade zone operator's bond, Customs agrees that the current foreign trade zone operator's bond is inadequate to secure
the operator's performance with respect to movement of goods from one zone to another. Changes have been made to 19
CFR 113.73 in the final rule.

A commenter suggested that conforming changes referring to bonded carriers under 19 CFR 112.2(b) should be added
to 19 CFR 125.11 (a) and (b).

One commenter suggested that the procedures in part 125 seem to refer principally to cartmen, lightermen and, as proposed
in the NPRM, bonded carriers. He suggests that procedures pertaining to bonded warehouse proprietors and to operators
of container stations, centralized examination stations, and foreign trade zones should be made clear in the final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs agrees that procedures pertaining to cartage and lighterage by bonded warehouse proprietors and operators
of container stations, centralized examination stations and foreign trade zones should be included within part
125. Part 125 is amended accordingly.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter observed that both bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones are facilities with specific boundaries.
He suggested that Customs make clear whether receipt of merchandise by bonded warehouse proprietors for the purpose
of cartage constitutes receipt into a bonded warehouse and whether receipt of merchandise by a foreign trade zone
operator for the purpose of cartage constitutes receipt into an activated foreign trade zone area and the conferring
of foreign trade zone status.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Receipt of merchandise for cartage purposes to a bonded warehouse by its proprietor or to a foreign trade zone by its
operator constitutes receipt into the bonded warehouse or admission into the foreign trade zone. Customs approval
of such transfers will continue to be accomplished through existing local procedures.

After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined that
the proposed amendments, modified as discussed above, should be adopted. The final regulation will allow the cartage
and lighterage of merchandise for all purposes by bonded carriers without the necessity of obtaining a cartage license.
It will also allow bonded warehouse proprietors, foreign trade zone operators, container station operators and
centralized examination station operators to engage in limited cartage and lighterage under their respective bonds
and to transport merchandise to their respective facilities from anywhere in the district in which their facility
is located.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Roussel-Uclaf, Division Agro-Veterinaire, 163 Avenue Gambetta, 75020, Paris, France, is the sponsor of NADA 130&hyph;951,
represented by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., P.O. Box 2500, Rt. 202&hyph;206, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258.
The NADA provides for use of halofuginone hydrobromide (Stenorol) Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated
broiler feed used for the prevention of coccidiosis. The sponsor filed a supplemental application which provides
for the use of 2.72 grams per ton (3 parts per million) halofuginone hydrobromide for replacement cage layers and replacement
broiler breeders for the prevention of coccidiosis. The supplemental NADA is approved as of October 12, 1994 and the
regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.265(c) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom
of information summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This approval is for use of a Type A medicated article to make a Type C medicated feed. Halofuginone hydrobromide is
a Category II drug that, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Therefore, use of a halofuginone hydrobromide Type A article to make a Type C medicated feed as in NADA 130&hyph;951,
as supplemented, requires an approved form FDA 1900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), the
approval of this supplemental application qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning October 12,
1994 because the supplemental application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) or human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval of the supplemental application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an
environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving proposed Program Amendment Number 65 Revised to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment
was initiated by Ohio and is intended to update rule references and to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding
Federal regulations. The amendment concerns the authority of successor agencies within the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources and the availability of Ohio's permit, inspection, and enforcement records to the public.

II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;1990), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 65 (PA 65). In that submission, Ohio
proposed to revise two rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) to correct outdated rule references and to adopt
language similar to corresponding Federal regulations concerning the availability of documents for public view.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of PA 65, Ohio provided a draft example of the public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post
at one of the two locations specified by OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 10, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11227), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public
hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on April 11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated June 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2029), OSM provided its comments to Ohio on the February
23, 1994, submission of PA 65. By letter dated July 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2033), Ohio resubmitted
Program Amendment Number 65 Revised (PA 65R) which is intended to resolve the requirements in OSM's June 17, 1994,
letter. Ohio proposed new revisions to one rule and modified the draft example of the notice on the availability of
documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM reopened the public comment period in the August 5, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 39994). The public comment period closed on August 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a comment made by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), United States Department of Agriculture (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2056), OSM requested that Ohio provide a written statement for the Administrative
Record clarifying the points of agreement between the Division and the SCS. By letter dated September 23, 1994 (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2058), Ohio provided OSM with its intentions regarding the filing of coal mining
related documents at SCS field offices.

1. Corrected Rule Reference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 establishes that, in the event of a consolidation or reorganization of offices
within the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), the OAC rules which now apply to the Division of Reclamation
shall apply to and be the rules of any other Division or office which succeeds the Division of Reclamation as the administering
agency for Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1513. Ohio is revising this rule to expand the specific references to the Division
of Reclamation's rules to cover additional rules adopted by Ohio since OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 was first
promulgated. There is no counterpart Federal rule. However, the Director finds that this revision will not render
the Ohio program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

2. Availability of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is revising OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10 paragraph (B)(2) to provide additional ways that members of
the public may review Ohio's permit, inspection, and enforcement documents. Ohio is proposing that local district
offices of the ODNR, Division of Reclamation, shall maintain copies of all documents pertaining to both existing
and proposed mining operations within their jurisdiction, or post for public inspection a description of the information
available for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information. If Ohio does not maintain a district office
in the specific county of the existing or proposed mining operation, Ohio shall either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Make copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other subject information available for public
inspection at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Post, at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS, a description of the documents
available for inspection and the procedure by which members of the public may request copies of these documents. At
its own expense, Ohio shall promptly provide copies of documents by mail upon request of any resident of the area of
the mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The counterpart Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.14(c) provides that the regulatory authority shall make copies of these
documents available for public inspection or maintain a description of the information available for mailing and
the procedure for obtaining such information at a Federal, State or local government office in the county where mining
is occurring or proposed to occur. The proposed rule provides Ohio with options for meeting the obligation to make
permitting documents available to the public in the county where mining is occurring or proposed to occur. The Director,
therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio has designed a public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post at that county's office of the
county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS as specified in OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10(B)(2)(b).
This proposed notice clarifies that public comments on applicable permitting, inspection, enforcement, and regulatory
documents shall also be available for public inspection and copying. Ohio is also listing in the public notice the
counties which are under the jurisdiction of each of its five coal-regulatory district offices. The Director finds
that the proposed notice satisfies the requirements of and is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
The Ohio Historic Preservation Office provided comments in support of the proposed amendment. No other public comments
were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held.

Federal Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, acknowledged the proposed amendment with no
comment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), expressed concern with the requirement
that copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other information be retained in SCS field offices.
The SCS noted that this could involve a substantial amount of information in some counties with accelerated mining
activity. However, the SCS was not against posting for public inspection a description of the information available
for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information upon request by any resident of the area where mining is
occurring. Based on Ohio's letter dated September 23, 1994 (Administrative Record N. OH&hyph;2058), Ohio will make
sure that any approach for filing documents or posting notices at SCS offices would be acceptable to the SCS. As discussed
above, the Director has determined that Ohio's options for meeting the obligation to make permit, inspection, and
enforcement documents available to the public in the county where the mining is occurring or proposed to occur are
no less effective than the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No other comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect
to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). None of the revisions that Ohio proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative
Record No. OH&hyph;1993). The EPA responded on March 16, 1994, (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;1999) that Ohio
should add language in its proposed amendment to cover both existing and proposed mining operations. The Director
notes that Ohio's revised amendment at OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 (B)(2) and (B)(2)(b) covers both existing
and proposed mining operations and therefore satisfies EPA's concerns.

V. Director's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed program amendment as submitted by Ohio on February
23, 1994, and revised and resubmitted on July 20, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 935 codifying decisions concerning the Ohio program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of
State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Executive Order No. 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Management
Planning and Review). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would
be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant
vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication
more than 30 days prior to the start of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this regulation is published as a final rule, without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is
nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing
to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (CCGD11&hyph;94&hyph;004) for the
regulation and also include their name, address and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class World Championships
which will be conducted in the San Diego area in October and November 1994. In addition, exhibition races will be held
on two dates in October and November 1994 within San Diego Bay; special local regulations establishing measures promoting
the safety of these exhibition race is the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;006).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay, Mission Bay and the IACC race
venue during the IACC World Championship Races by controlling the traffic entering, exiting and traveling within
these waters. The anticipated concentration of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses
a safety concern, which is addressed in these special local regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A channel within San Diego Bay has been designated for the exclusive use of IACC vessels during specifically prescribed
hours. This channel (the America's Cup Channel) is adjacent to the dredged main ship channel and bounded by the shoreline
of North Island. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the geographic area of applicability of these special local regulations, speed limits and operating requirements
have been established for orderly passage to and from the IACC shore facilities and race venue. The America's Cup Channel
passes through the Security Zone listed in 33 CFR 165.1105 adjacent to naval piers J through P on the western shore of
North Island. Participants, vessels carrying race officials, and patrol vessels may transit this Security Zone
during the periods these Special Local Regulations are in effect, unless otherwise notified through Broadcast Notice
to Mariners and by patrol vessels on scene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During these same times,
vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and a five knot speed limit. These requirements will be
activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. Activation of these regulations
will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are established for the period of these regulations to promote smooth
traffic flow and ensure access to docks and piers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within the navigable
waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating in and
viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside the
navigable waters of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory
periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented
in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.

Federalism. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Offices at the address listed under

ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) All spectator vessels should remain clear of the race venue and avoid interfering with any participant, AC'95
Vessels or Official Vessels. Interference with race activities may constitute a safety hazard warranting cancellation
or termination of all or part of the World Championship race activities by the Patrol Commander.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Any unauthorized entry within the race course perimeter, as marked by the AC'95 Vessels and Official Vessels,
by spectator vessels constitutes a risk to the safety of marine traffic. Such entry will constitute a factor to be considered
in determining whether a person has operated a vessel in a negligent manner in violation of 46 U.S.C. 2302.

One way traffic and five knot speed limit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Patrol Commander may implement one-way traffic patterns and a five knot speed limit in the regulated areas or portions
thereof if the Patrol Commander deems it necessary to ensure safe navigation. Notice of one-way traffic and a five
knot speed limit shall be made by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. If one-way traffic patterns are implemented, spectator
and participant vessels are required to transit the applicable regulated area(s) in either an inbound direction
(proceeding into port) or an outbound direction (proceeding to sea). No traffic in any direction other than inbound
or outbound (i.e., cross traffic) will be permitted in the area of implementation. If a five knot speed limit or one-way
traffic is implemented, all participant and spectator vessels shall also abide by all other nonconflicting provisions
contained within these special local regulations associated with the regulated area. If a five knot speed limit is
implemented in San Diego Bay, all traffic entering or exiting the harbors will be required to make a speed of no more
than five knots through the water.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would
be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant
vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication
more than 30 days prior to the start of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this regulation is published as a final rule, without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is
nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing
to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (CCGD11&hyph;94&hyph;006) for the
regulation and also include their name, address and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class World Championships
which will be conducted within San Diego Bay in October and November 1994. In addition, ocean races will be conducted
in the Pacific Ocean offshore of San Diego in October and November 1994; special local regulations establishing measures
promoting the safety of these ocean races is the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;004).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
/
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay during the exhibition races
by controlling the traffic entering, exiting and traveling within these waters. The anticipated concentration
of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses a safety concern, which is addressed in these
special local regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the regulatory period prescribed in these regulations, specified portions of San Diego Bay will be closed
to all vessel traffic except vessels designated by the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander. A designated channel, adjacent
to the dredged main ship channel, bounded by the shoreline of North Island and passing through the Security Zone defined
in 33 CFR 165.1105 adjacent to naval piers J through P on the western shore of North Island will be available for non-participating
vessels to enter, exit and travel within San Diego Bay during the regulatory period. Those vessels wishing to use this
channel to enter or exit San Diego Bay must obtain permission to proceed from the Patrol Commander at least 30 minutes
prior to the expected transit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during the exhibition races and when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During
these times, spectator vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These operating requirements are applicable to all vessels operating within San Diego Bay preceding, during and
following the IACC boat races, unless otherwise specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory
periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented
in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Offices at the address listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tacoma, Washington, area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) (official designation codified at 40 CFR 81.348). The air quality planning requirements
for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP
revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing
its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of title I advanced in this notice and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action
on the State of Washington's moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Tacoma nonattainment area (referred to as Tacoma or the
Tacoma Tideflats), EPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.
Additional information supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address
indicated above. Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated
nonattainment under CAA section 107(d)(4)(B)) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions
by November 15, 1991:

 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically
applicable to PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted
to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice
and supporting information.

1. Provisions to ensure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provisions to ensure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area (see sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were
required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources
of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see CAA section 189(a)). The Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE) submitted
the new source review requirements for this area on October 22, 1993. EPA will address that submittal in a separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993, which become effective without
further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the
PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see CAA section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and
13543&hyph;13544). EPA addresses the contingency measures the State has submitted for Tacoma in part II.8 of the
discussion below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
Section 110(k)(4) of the Act authorizes EPA to approve a plan revision based on a commitment by the State to adopt specific
enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision.
EPA would then assess the approvability of the submittal after the State fulfilled its commitment. However, if the
State fails to comply with its commitment, section 110(k)(4) provides that a conditional approval shall be treated
as a disapproval. If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179
of the Act and the Federal implementation plan clock under section 110(c)(1) of the Act will begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this action, EPA is granting conditional approval of the plan revisions submitted to EPA for Tacoma, Washington,
on November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 (hereafter generally referred to as a single submittal), except for the following
elements of the SIP which are described below or in the Technical Support Document associated with this rulemaking.
EPA is approving these following elements without conditions: exclusion from precursor controls, the monitoring
network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy
of funding and authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA conditionally approves the submittal because it does not fully meet certain applicable requirements of the CAA
for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. The submittal does not meet the requirements to provide for the implementation
of RACM (including RACT), to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or demonstrate that timely attainment
is not practicable), and to provide for quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress. See CAA sections
172(c)(1), 189(a)(1)(C), 189(a)(1)(B) and 189(c). Some of the control measures relied on to satisfy these requirements
have not been made enforceable emission limitations. CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6). However, the State
has submitted a commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures on or before January 1, 1995, and to address the
applicable requirements of the Act. In its June 30, 1994 SIP revision, the State committed to submitting federally
enforceable emission limits to EPA by January 1, 1995 for the following major stationary sources identified in the
SIP: Buffelen Woodworking, Continental Grain, Continental Lime, Domtar Gypsum, Puget Sound Plywood, USG Interiors,
US Oil and Refining, Woodworth, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation and Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submittal is substantive and contains some specific enforceable control measures. Accordingly, EPA is conditionally
approving the submittal, as authorized under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA. EPA also approves, without conditions,
the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 below, the monitoring network, the procedures
for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy of funding and authority.

Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions
of section 110(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
CAA section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Washington Department of Ecology conducted a public hearing to receive public comment on the State implementation
plan revision for PM&hyph;10 in Tacoma on November 7, 1991. WDOE adopted the implementation plan for the area on November
15, 1991, and submitted it to EPA the same day. In 1994, the plan was revised to amend its request for conditional approval.
WDOE conducted a public hearing to obtain public input on this revision on February 17, 1994. The letter revising the
request for conditional approval was submitted to EPA on June 30, 1994. The November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 SIP submittals
were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part
51, appendix V. Letters dated May 12, 1992 and August 1, 1994, were forwarded to the WDOE indicating the completeness
of the submittals and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. PM&hyph;10 Emissions Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate and
current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions
inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area.
See, e.g., CAA section 110(a)(2)(K). Because the submission of such inventories are necessary to an area's attainment
demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received
with the attainment/nonattainment demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WDOE submitted an emissions inventory of estimated actual emissions for the base year of 1987 and the attainment year
of 1994. The 24-hour emission inventory identified three major source categories contributing to particulate matter
in the Tacoma Tideflats. These are, in descending order of greatest contribution, industrial stack emissions (66
percent); vehicle resuspended road dust (18 percent); and industrial fugitive emissions (13 percent). Other contributing
sources were area sources, such as residential wood combustion and motor vehicle exhaust. The emission inventory
is dominated by one point source, the Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company (Simpson), a paper pulp producer, which accounts
for 45 percent of the emission inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For sources within the nonattainment area, the emissions inventory provides a comprehensive list of particulate
sources and utilizes appropriate factor and estimations that were available at the time the SIP revision was prepared.
However, the emission inventory may underestimate the impact of PM&hyph;10 sources outside of the nonattainment
area. Possibly due to where the nonattainment area boundaries were drawn, there may be a significant source of PM&hyph;10
outside of the nonattainment area. As is discussed in the Technical Support Document (TSD), substantial evidence
indicates that imported residential wood combustion accounts for a large portion of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma
Tideflats. For further information, the reader is referred to the TSD accompanying this action, which is available
at the EPA address indicated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emissions inventory estimating actual emissions along with additional available information provides a sufficient
basis for determining the technical adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements
of section 172(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An additional attainment year emission inventory issue, relating to the attainment demonstration, and other requirements,
is the use of actual instead of allowable emission estimates for projecting attainment. This issue will be discussed
in more detail under the demonstration section of this document. Again, the reader is referred to the TSD corresponding
with this action for further information.

The EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
in the form of the 1987 PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline. The guidance provided in this document appears to be
consistent with the Act. See CAA section 193.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. RACM (Including RACT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to ensure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see CAA sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General
Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57
FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In broad terms, the State should identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in
light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject available control
measures if the measures are technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. In addition,
RACM, does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and RACM does not
require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment of the
NAAQS and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment. 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington's control strategy for the Tacoma area provides for attainment of the 24-hour standard based on control
of industrial emissions, fugitive industrial emissions including resuspended road dust, and residential wood
combustion. However, as indicated below, some of the control measures are deficient because they are not reflected
in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) &amp; 172(c)(6). The State has committed to
address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal
relative to the RACM (Including RACT) requirement. The available control measures to be implemented in Tacoma include
the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Industrial Controls
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The largest single reduction in the projected emission inventory results from the control of industrial stack emissions.
As stated earlier, Simpson accounts for 45 percent of the emission inventory. In 1991, Simpson replaced the #2,3,4,5
hogged fuel boilers and #1 oil boiler at the mill with a new hogged fuel boiler. Emissions from the new boiler represent
a 984 kg/day reduction in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total
baseline emissions inventory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, changes in industrial processes resulted in decreased emissions; for example, U.S. Oil and Refining
and Simpson changed fuel sources to burn natural gas. The SIP assumes that emissions from mobile sources will grow
modestly from 1987 to 1994. Even including these growth projections, the overall reduction in industrial PM&hyph;10
stack emissions due to implementation of controls for all sources combined is projected to be 17 percent of the base
year's inventory. However, these industrial changes and controls have not been expressed as enforceable emission
limitations. As discussed earlier, WDOE has committed to submit enforceable emissions limits on the industrial
sources by January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Industrial Fugitive and Resuspended Road Dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tacoma emission inventory identified industrial fugitive emissions and resuspended road dust as significant
contributors of particulate matter to the airshed. The Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (PSAPCA) is a local
air pollution control agency that has jurisdiction over four counties in Washington State; PSAPCA's jurisdiction
includes the Tacoma Tideflats. PSAPCA's fugitive dust regulation (Regulation I, section 9.15) was designed to reduce
fugitive dust from commercial and industrial activities and also to reduce dust emissions from paved and unpaved
roads and parking lots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PSAPCA requires ``Best Available Control Technology (BACT)'' under section 9.15 for all fugitive emissions from
all incinerators, boilers, manufacturing equipment and air pollution control equipment. The Tacoma attainment
plan lists and documents emission reductions from several major facilities that were required to pave roads or add
PM&hyph;10 controls as the result of PSAPCA's application of section 9.15. Puget Sound Plywood, Lone Star, Woodworth
and Buffelen were required to either pave roads or modify production processes to comply with section 9.15. The SIP
estimates that the application of section 9.15 would result in a reduction of 73 kg/day of fugitive emissions from
industrial sources. After accounting for an increase of 39 kg/day due to industrial growth, the net total reduction
from the base year to the attainment year of fugitive emissions is 34 kg/day. EPA accepts the emission reductions claimed
from this control measure as reasonable. Since it is generally impractical to source test fugitive emission sources,
a SIP must rely on calculated emission estimates, and control efficiency estimates, to arrive at emission reduction
estimates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control of resuspended road dust is a significant component of section 9.15. PSAPCA applies the same section 9.15
BACT provisions to dust emissions from both private and public paved and unpaved roads. In addition, all private roadways
adjoining paved public roads and all commercial properties with access points abutting paved public roads in the
Tacoma nonattainment area are required to implement BACT to stabilize vehicular entrances and exits. The control
measure also appropriately prioritized preventing material deposition on roadways over mitigating measures after
deposition. Looking specifically at the control of resuspended road dust, the plan uses an overall emission reduction
credit of 37 percent from resuspended road dust. EPA accepts this estimate as reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Residential Wood Combustion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously noted, there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that imported residential wood combustion
is a large source of Tacoma's PM&hyph;10. All three receptor models concluded that woodsmoke was one of the main sources
of particulate matter in the Tacoma Tideflats area. The most recent receptor modeling study suggested that residential
wood combustion was an unexpectedly strong source of PM&hyph;10. This is also supported by the Saturation Study conducted
by EPA. Additional discussion of the impact of imported residential wood combustion can be found in the TSD associated
with this action. Because of the likely impact of imported residential wood combustion on Tacoma's airshed, the available
control measures adopted for residential wood combustion are discussed here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PSAPCA initiated a voluntary woodsmoke curtailment program throughout its four county jurisdictional area, including
Tacoma, in the winter of 1987&hyph;88. The program changed to mandatory curtailment beginning with the 1988&hyph;89
heating season, pursuant to WAC 173&hyph;433 and the PSAPCA Regulation I, Article 13. The curtailment program is
a two stage plan. At Stage I, which is imposed when ambient PM&hyph;10 levels reach 75 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the use of uncertified stoves and fireplaces are banned. At Stage II, imposed when PM&hyph;10 levels reach 105 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, all woodheating (fireplaces, certified and uncertified woodstoves) is prohibited. The program exempts homes
with no other source of heat. WDOE and PSAPCA regulations contain additional controls, including the prohibition
of all fuels except dry, seasoned wood in woodheating devices. Plume opacity for woodheating devices is limited to
20 percent, with brief exceedances allowed for fire starting and stoking. PSAPCA serves as the primary enforcement
agency for the curtailment and opacity portions of the control program. Both WDOE and PSAPCA administer public education
programs targeted at residential wood burning. Throughout the State, WDOE also enforces a ban on the sale of uncertified
woodstoves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The strength and depth of the legislated woodsmoke program, and the size and historical effectiveness of the agencies
involved, demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that the Tacoma area is achieving a sufficient compliance rate to justify
the 70 percent emission reduction credit taken for these measures. A more detailed analysis of the Washington woodsmoke
curtailment plan is contained in the TSD. Since PSAPCA administers the woodsmoke curtailment program throughout
its four-county jurisdictional area and the program affects sources both within the nonattainment area and in adjoining
areas, the 70 percent emission reduction credit is applicable to both residential wood combustion generated in the
nonattainment area and imported residential wood combustion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated, where sources of PM&hyph;10 contribute insignificantly to the PM&hyph;10 problem in the area, EPA's
policy is that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures. 57 FR 13540. Further,
EPA has indicated that for some sources in areas which demonstrate timely attainment, RACM does not require the implementation
of otherwise available control measures that are not ``reasonably'' available because their implementation would
not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13543). In the Tacoma situation, EPA believes the significant sources, as well
as several less significant sources, of PM&hyph;10 in the area have been reasonably controlled. Thus, EPA believes
that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures or technology for other
de minimis sources of PM&hyph;10 in the area. Further, EPA believes implementation of such additional controls in
this area would not expedite attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures and an explanation
as to why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's
explanation and associated documentation and concludes that it adequately justifies the control measures to be
implemented. However, as addressed in more detail in part II.4 below, not all of the emission reductions necessary
to ensure expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS are embodied in enforceable emission limitations. Thus,
EPA is conditionally approving the control measures submitted for Tacoma, based upon a commitment by the State that
it will submit to EPA by January 1, 1995, legally enforceable emission limits for the significant stack sources in
Tacoma. See CAA section 110(k)(4). This conditional approval is discussed further in the section below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December
31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling
for moderate area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, if the State does not submit a demonstration
of attainment, the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994, is impracticable (CAA section 189(a)(1)(B)(ii)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several studies have been conducted to determine sources of particulate matter in the Tacoma nonattainment area.
WDOE and PSAPCA employed pollutant dispersion models in the Tacoma nonattainment area using both guideline and non-guideline
models. Neither RAM (guideline) nor WYNDvalley (non-guideline) yielded results that were well correlated to measured
values. It is difficult to determine precisely why dispersion modeling failed to yield acceptable values in the Tacoma
Tideflats when similar approaches have proven successful elsewhere, but the TSD raises possible explanations,
including where the boundaries of the nonattainment were drawn and how the background PM&hyph;10 concentration
was established. The reader is referred to the ``Description of Air Quality Modeling'' section of the TSD associated
with this action for further information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to dispersion modeling, three receptor modeling studies were conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats to try
to determine source contribution of PM&hyph;10. Separate from these receptor modeling studies, a saturation study
was conducted to determine the site of maximum impact in the Tacoma nonattainment area. Unfortunately, no single
study conclusively apportions the amount of PM&hyph;10 attributable to different sources. As is discussed in the
TSD, EPA has reservations about each of these studies because of study design flaws, errors in conducting the study,
or changing composition of particulate matter in the airshed. See the ``Attainment Demonstration'' section of the
TSD for a longer discussion of the individual studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Faced with several studies, none of which were definitive, the WDOE attempted to address several diverse scenarios
to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the area. The SIP contains three demonstrations
of attainment and maintenance all using rollback, a modified attainment demonstration that EPA may accept on a case-by-case
basis. The first demonstration presented in the SIP is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the
second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback. Tacoma's
SIP meets the criteria for using rollback as outlined in EPA guidance (Attachment 5 of''PM&hyph;10 Moderate Area
SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product,'' April 2, 1990). EPA's primary concern about the demonstrations in the SIP
is that they underestimate the amount of PM&hyph;10 from residential wood combustion coming into the nonattainment
area from surrounding areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the TSD, EPA believes that when looking at the receptor modeling and saturation studies as a whole,
there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that residential wood combustion was and is a major source of PM&hyph;10
in the airshed. As discussed in the TSD, this residential wood combustion is probably being imported into the nonattainment
area, and a conservative lower bound estimate is that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats
on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. A more detailed discussion of this point can be found
in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that there has been uncertainty over source contribution in the Tacoma nonattainment area despite numerous
efforts by PSAPCA, WDOE, EPA and other entities to characterize the airshed. In reviewing the SIP, EPA has considered
all relevant studies referenced in the SIP as well as additional information, such as the saturation study. Based
on these studies, EPA finds that imported residential wood combustion is a much larger source of PM&hyph;10 than currently
accounted for in the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To evaluate the impact of imported residential wood combustion into the nonattainment area, the TSD associated with
the rulemaking contains a rollback analysis that incorporates a relatively conservative estimate of the residential
wood combustion being imported into the nonattainment area. As noted earlier, Tacoma's SIP meets the criteria for
using rollback. In the ``Attainment Demonstration'' discussion of the TSD, EPA sets out a rollback scenario that
incorporates the estimate that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats on the design day is attributable
to residential wood combustion. A mandatory residential woodsmoke curtailment program is being imposed over a four-county
area that includes the Tacoma Tideflats and surrounding contiguous areas. As discussed earlier in section II.3 of
this document, PSAPCA's mandatory woodstove curtailment program warrants a 70 percent control measure credit.
After applying control measure credit for the mandatory woodstove curtailment program, the rollback scenario presented
in the TSD demonstrates; to EPA's satisfaction, that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be attained by 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assurance of attainment and maintenance rests with the SIP's control measures. The SIP contains a broad array of control
measures aimed at both industrial and residential sources. Based on the emission inventory and related information
about the estimated contribution from residential wood combustion, these control measures, when they are made fully
enforceable (see below), will be sufficient to ensure attainment and maintenance. It should be noted that a major
problem with the attainment demonstration is the attainment year emission inventory used for point (stack) sources.
The inventory was based on actual emission estimates. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised, July 1986)
generally requires use of allowable emissions in inventories for the purposes of modeling attainment of the NAAQS
(see also CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2)(K) and 172(c)(6) of the Act). The requirement takes into consideration
possible increases from existing sources allowed by their permits, registrations, or other regulatory mechanisms
and ensures that the control measures relied on in the SIP are based on enforceable emission limitations. WDOE and
PSAPCA, based on comments from EPA, were not able to demonstrate that all point source emissions in the nonattainment
area would be unable to increase significantly above actual levels. Consequently, there is no objective assurance,
or legally enforceable mechanism in place, to restrict a point source from emitting above the estimated actual rate,
should the source have the physical capacity. Therefore, to ensure that the NAAQS will be protected in the Tacoma nonattainment
area, the currently allowable emission limits must be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the fact that Tacoma has been monitoring daily at the site determined to be the site of maximum impact and has
not had an exceedance of the NAAQS at any monitor in four years, there are no legal limits in place to prevent future increases
from a few industrial facilities that could consequently threaten attainment of the NAAQS. On June 30, 1994, WDOE
submitted a request for conditional approval of the Tacoma nonattainment plan based on a commitment to reconcile
the actual/allowable emission limitation issue and thereby establish an enforceable attainment demonstration.
WDOE's commitment includes a schedule to issue regulatory orders to appropriate point sources within the nonattainment
area that will restrict emissions (i.e. establish allowable emission limitations) at or below the ``actual'' emission
estimates used in the attainment demonstration. EPA conditionally approves the attainment demonstration for Tacoma
on the basis of this commitment. See CAA section 110(k)(4). The revisions to the emission limitations for the affected
sources will make enforceable the actual emission limitations already being achieved and implemented in the area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like the attainment demonstration, Tacoma's SIP contained three maintenance demonstrations. The first demonstration
is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional
rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback; however, the last demonstration failed to show maintenance
through 1997. EPA believes that the failure of the third demonstration to show maintenance through 1997 is due to the
SIP's low estimate of imported residential woodsmoke.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ``Evaluation of Attainment Demonstration'' section of the accompanying TSD, EPA considered additional information
and analyses in assessing the maintenance demonstration, including using rollback that differs from the SIP in its
estimate of the amount of residential wood combustion affecting the airshed. EPA believes that after evaluating
all of the studies of the Tacoma Tideflats, there is sufficient evidence to support an interpretation that imported
residential wood combustion is a much stronger source of PM&hyph;10 than currently accounted for in the SIP. Similar
to the demonstration of attainment presented in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD, EPA believes a greater
background value that accounts for a large importation of residential woodsmoke should be employed in the maintenance
demonstration. Using the emission inventory, growth factors, and point source emission levels presented in the
SIP, considering additional information about the contribution of residential wood combustion and employing the
same background value as was used in the attainment demonstration discussed in the TSD, the rollback analysis demonstrates
maintenance through 1997, and would therefore satisfy the initial quantitative milestones due for this area, as
discussed in part II.6 below. However, as with the attainment demonstration, some of the control measures relied
on to demonstrate continued maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the SIP are deficient because they are not reflected
in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) &amp; 172(c)(6). The State has committed to
address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal
relative to the quantitative milestone and reasonable further progress requirements discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accompanying TSD discusses the dispersion, receptor and saturation studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats,
estimates the amount of PM&hyph;10 attributable to residential wood combustion, and presents a rollback demonstration
for attainment and maintenance that incorporates the estimate that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma
Tideflats on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. The reader is referred to the TSD associated
with this document for a more detailed discussion of any of these points.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10, also apply to major stationary
sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing
how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) of the Act (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three receptor modeling studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats show that sulfates and nitrates are not a significant
portion of the Tacoma PM&hyph;10 in the airshed. The three studies are discussed in the TSD. The two receptor modeling
studies conducted during the 1980s show that nitrates accounted for less than 4 percent of the total PM&hyph;10 sampled
mass, while sulfates contributed even less measuring less than 2.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third receptor modeling study, the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation of the Atmospheric Deposition of Toxic Contaminants to Puget Sound
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 study was conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats during 1989 and 1990. The Atmospheric Deposition Study collected fine
particulate (&gt; 2.5 &mu;m) and coarse particulate (&gt; 50 &mu;m). Most of the precursor particles would be occurring
in the fine particle range. The analysis of the fine particles showed that SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was 9.3 percent of the total mass of fine particles, while NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 accounted for approximately 5 percent of total mass of fine particles. As discussed in the ``Evaluation of Attainment
Demonstration'' in the accompanying TSD, the Atmospheric Deposition Study was conducted during a period when the
airshed was considerably cleaner than the design year. Moreover, control measures were in place during the Atmospheric
Deposition Study's sampling period; five of the sampling days occurred during a ban on the use of uncertified woodstoves.
Therefore, the results of this study are likely to show less PM&hyph;10 due to woodsmoke than probably occurred during
the design year. Correspondingly, the study's assessment of the amount of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 found in the airshed is likely to be greater on a percentage basis than would have been the case during the design year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the relatively small amount of sulfates and nitrates in the airshed, EPA has determined that it is unlikely that
precursors do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in Tacoma. In addition to
these receptor analyses, a review of the emissions inventory for this area did not reveal any major stationary sources
of PM&hyph;10 precursors. The effect of this finding is to exclude major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors
from PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA is making a general finding about the contribution of PM&hyph;10 precursors for Tacoma, the determination
is based on the current character of the area including the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore,
that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance
addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area.

6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every three (3) years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP,
as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further
progress is defined in CAA section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated
attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first 3-year period or how many milestones
must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting
the 3-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision
containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas). See 57 FR 13539. As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially
addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas must demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at
a minimum, provide for continued maintenance of the standards.

 Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.''
However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation of an area as attainment
is contingent upon several factors and future events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it is unreasonable to require planning for each nonattainment area to cover quantitative milestones
years into the future because of the possibility that such time may elapse before an area is in fact redesignated attainment.
On the other hand, EPA believes it is reasonable for States initially to submit a sufficient number of milestones to
ensure that there is continuing air quality protection beyond the attainment deadline. Addressing two milestones
will ensure that the State continues to maintain the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during
which an area could be redesignated attainment. However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed
if an area is not redesignated attainment within the time period covered by the initial milestones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In implementing RFP for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration and control strategy
for the area to assess whether the initial milestones have been satisfied and to determine whether annual incremental
reductions, different from those provided in the SIP, should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see CAA section 171(1)). As indicated, the State of Washington's PM&hyph;10 SIP for Tacoma
demonstrates attainment in 1994 and maintenance through 1997, and therefore would satisfy RFP and initial quantitative
milestones (see 57 FR 13539) if all of the control measures relied upon were reflected in enforceable emission limitations.
However, as discussed previously, WDOE and PSAPCA based attainment and maintenance demonstrations on actual emission
estimates instead of the required allowable rates. The State has committed to adopt the necessary enforceable allowable
emission limits by January 1, 1995. Accordingly, as with other requirements discussed elsewhere in this document,
EPA is conditionally approving the submittal relative to the RFP and initial milestone requirements. CAA section

7. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by WDOE and EPA (see CAA sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were stated in a September
23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et
al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement
of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see CAA section 110(a)(2)(C)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WDOE's control measures and regulations for control of Particulate Matter, which are contained in the SIP, are addressed
above under the section headed ``RACM (including RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of activities
identified in that discussion including, for example, fugitive emissions from point sources; vehicle resuspended
road dust; and residential wood combustion. The SIP provides that the affected activities will be controlled throughout
the entire nonattainment area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TSD contains further information on enforceability requirements including enforceable emission limitations;
a description of the rules contained in the SIP and the source types subject to them; test methods and compliance schedules;
malfunction provisions; excess emission provisions; correctly cited references of incorporated methods/rules;
and

reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both WDOE and PSAPCA have responsibilities in the implementation and enforcement of control measures in the Tacoma
nonattainment area. PSAPCA retains authority over all area sources and all but the two stationary sources in Tacoma
that are regulated by the Department of Ecology. PSAPCA has many compliance inspectors and, as discussed further
in the TSD, EPA considers PSAPCA's staffing level adequate to ensure that the Tacoma attainment plan is fully implemented.
As a necessary adjunct of its enforcement program, PSAPCA also has broad powers to adopt rules and regulations, issue
orders, assess penalties, require access to records and information, and receive and disburse funds. The Washington
State Department of Ecology has adequate authority to implement and enforce the plan in the event PSAPCA fails to make
a good faith effort to implement and/or enforce the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two point sources in the Tacoma nonattainment area not under PSAPCA's jurisdiction are the Simpson Tacoma Kraft
Company and Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation. These sources are regulated by the Washington State Department
of Ecology. The Washington State Department of Ecology's legal authorities, personnel and funding sources are discussed
in the accompanying TSD. EPA finds these authorities and funding mechanisms adequate to ensure that the State will
be able to enforce the control measures in the Tacoma nonattainment area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Controls on area sources, such as the residential wood combustion program and the fugitive dust control program are
also enforceable. Discussion and justification of EPA's reasoning can be found in the control measure section of
this document and the TSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the use of actual emission estimates rather than the significantly
higher emission limits allowed in the current WDOE or PSAPCA regulations is unacceptable. WDOE, PSAPCA, and EPA could
only enforce the allowable emissions that are currently contained in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. There are no
mechanisms for any of the regulatory agencies to enforce the emission estimates used in the attainment and maintenance
demonstration because they are well below the legal limits allowed in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. A discussion
regarding the use of actual instead of allowable emissions contained in the demonstration portion of this document
provides background for the enforceability decision. The Region is granting a conditional approval of the Tacoma
attainment plan based on the commitment contained in the June 30, 1994, submittal which will make the emissions from
point sources enforceable at or below the levels used to demonstrate attainment and maintenance. EPA will need additional
technical documentation from WDOE if the emission levels in the regulatory orders are greater than those used in the
attainment and three year maintenance demonstrations. Additionally, WDOE would need to provide cogent attainment
and maintenance demonstrations in order for the SIP to be fully approved.

8. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 &amp; 13543&hyph;13544). These measures must
be submitted by November 15, 1993, for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist
of other available measures that are not part of the area's core control strategy. These measures must take effect
without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain
the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessing the adequacy of Tacoma's contingency measures is tied to the attainment demonstration because Tacoma
has submitted industrial emissions controls in excess of those needed to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS as a contingency measure. As discussed above, Simpson's boiler replacement alone represents a 984 kg/day reduction
in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total baseline emissions
inventory. Based on the rollback discussion provided in the accompanying TSD, the Tacoma SIP contains emissions
limits and contingency measures that provide for reductions greater than the 25 percent contingency measure emissions
reduction value suggested in the General Preamble (57 FR 13543&hyph;13544). Further discussion can be found in the
``Contingency Measure'' section of the accompanying TSD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contingency measures submitted as part of the Tacoma SIP ranged from a commitment to implement mobile source controls
to crediting the emission limitations already existing in the SIP that would be in excess of those needed to address
the RACM (including RACT) requirement. The two mobile source contingency measures in the 1991 SIP were directed at
reducing emissions from diesel vehicles: (1) the establishment of an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program,
and (2) the reduction in sulfur content of on-highway diesel fuel. In 1993, Washington State expanded its I/M program
to include the Tacoma area, and the desulfurization program was implemented nationally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only the measures that are being implemented prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain or achieve
RFP, that would be in excess of those necessary to provide for timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS and that, therefore,
go beyond RACM (including RACT) can be relied on as contingency measures. The measures will provide for continued
emissions reduction progress beyond the core control strategy. Further, because the State would implement these
precautionary measures prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain the NAAQS or achieve RFP,
these measures essentially provide advance contingency benefit and satisfy the requirement that they ``take effect
. . . without further action by the State, or the Administrator.'' EPA believes it would be unreasonable to penalize
or otherwise discourage the State from taking the arguably more precautionary air quality management step of accelerating
the implementation of these contingency measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it cannot be determined whether these measures are in excess of those necessary to provide for expeditious
attainment and necessary to address RACM (including RACT) until the State addresses the deficiencies associated
with its core control strategy. As indicated elsewhere, the State has committed to convert measures necessary to
address RACM (including RACT) to enforceable emission limitations. Until this commitment is fulfilled, EPA cannot
conclude that the contingency measures go beyond the core control strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is conditionally approving these contingency measures. Due to the submission of emission reductions
that are purportedly in excess of those necessary to demonstrate timely attainment and necessary to satisfy RACM
as a contingency measure, final approval or disapproval of these contingency measures must be determined when WDOE
submits the regulatory orders establishing enforceable emission limits for the stationary sources in the Tacoma
Tideflats.

III. Implications of This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA conditionally approves the plan revisions submitted to EPA for the Tacoma, Washington, nonattainment area on
November 15, 1991, and June 30, 1994, except for the following elements which EPA approves in full. EPA also approves,
without conditions, the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 above, the monitoring
network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy
of funding and authority. EPA will assess the final approvability of the submittals EPA is conditionally approving
after the State fulfills its commitment to submit enforceable emission limitations by January 1, 1995. If the State
fails to comply with its commitment, the conditional approval will become a disapproval.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2224), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866
review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (see CAA
section 307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective on December 12, 1994 unless adverse comments are
received by November 14, 1994. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all
public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see the proposed
rule published, simultaneously, in the proposal section of this

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditional approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the State's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing State requirements nor does it
substitute a new Federal requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

I. Clean Air Act Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or Act), requires certain States to revise and improve existing I/M programs
or implement new ones. All ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a basic or enhanced
I/M program depending upon its nonattainment classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition,
Congress directed the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into
consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States must incorporate
EPA's guidance into SIPs for all areas required by the Act to have an I/M program. Metropolitan statistical areas with
populations of 100,000 or more that are within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region also are required to meet EPA guidance
for enhanced I/M programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has designated three areas as nonattainment for ozone in the State of New Hampshire. The New Hampshire portion
of the Boston-Lawrence-Salem Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area is classified serious for ozone, the
Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), also classified serious for ozone, and the Manchester
MSA, classified marginal for ozone. The designations for ozone were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FR) on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694) and November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56762) and have been codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) at 40 CFR 81.300 through 81.437. Based on these nonattainment designations, an enhanced I/M program
is required in Hillsborough, Rockingham, and Strafford Counties. In addition, these MSAs have populations of over
100,000 and are included in the Ozone Transport Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although parts of Merrimack County are in the Manchester MSA, the county could be exempted since, in New England, MSAs
are defined by town, not by county; more than fifty percent of the MSA population would still be in the I/M program; and
the population density is less than 200 persons per square mile. Under EPA's I/M rule 40 CFR 51.350(b)(1) such portions
of Merrimack County are not required to implement I/M. However, all of Merrimack County is included to provide an opportunity
to generate enforceable emission reductions that may be used to help provide opportunity for economic growth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, EPA is conditionally approving the New Hampshire I/M SIP revision. EPA has reviewed the State submittals
against the statutory requirements under the Act and for consistency with EPA regulations. In letters dated May 19,
1994 and June 28, 1994, New Hampshire indicated its intent to address a number of outstanding issues discussed in this
document as well as in the July 18, 1994 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR), and to submit necessary revisions to EPA
by August 18, 1994. New Hampshire submitted such revisions on August 18. They are consistent with the NPR as discussed
below and fully meet the requirements of the I/M rule, except for the portions being conditionally approved in this
document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three parts of the program, on-road testing, compliance via diagnostic inspection, and enforcement against inspectors
require more time to resolve and provide the basis for today's conditional approval. As requested by New Hampshire,
the state will have until July 29, 1995 to submit revisions to address these three areas. If such revisions are submitted
by that date, fulfill the conditions set forth in this document, and fully meet the requirements of the I/M rule, the
state will have met the specified conditions and the I/M SIP will be fully approved. If not, this conditional approval
will automatically convert to a disapproval. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, more detailed
support for conditionally approving the State submittal is contained in the technical support document which is
available from the New England Regional Office, listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), EPA published a final regulation establishing the I/M requirements, pursuant to
sections 182 and 187 of the Act. The I/M regulation was codified at 40 CFR part 51, subpart S, and requires States to submit,
by November 15, 1993, an I/M SIP revision including all necessary legal authority and the items specified in 40 CFR
51.350(a)(1) through 51.373.

On February 28, 1994, April 19, 1994, and April 21, 1994, the State of New Hampshire submitted an I/M SIP for its three
nonattainment areas. Public hearings for the submittals were held on January 5 and 6, 1994 for the February 28, 1994
SIP submittal, and on March 8, 1994 for the April 19, 1994 SIP submittal. The April 21, 1994 submittal contained only
administrative materials to supplement the April 19 submission. EPA submitted written comments to the state on March
18, 1994. In letters dated May 19, 1994 and June 28, 1994, the state agreed to submit by August 19, 1994, additional information
to address the areas discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submittals provide for the implementation of an enhanced I/M program in four counties in New Hampshire beginning
in 1995. New Hampshire will be implementing a biennial, test-only I/M program meeting the requirements of the I/M
performance standard and other requirements contained in EPA's I/M rule. Testing will be overseen by the New Hampshire
Department of Safety (NHDOS) and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), with actual testing
done by a contractor. Other aspects of the New Hampshire I/M program include: testing of 1968 and later light duty vehicles
and trucks and heavy duty trucks, evaporative emission testing for 1975 and later model year vehicles, a test fee to
ensure the State has adequate resources to implement the program, enforcement by registration suspension, a repair
effectiveness program, contractual requirements for testing convenience, quality assurance, data collection,
minimum expenditure, time extension and hardship waivers, reporting, test equipment and test procedure specifications,
public information and consumer protection, inspector training and certification, and penalties against inspector
incompetence. In addition, the enhanced I/M program will include: IM240 testing for 1981 and newer vehicles, an on-road
testing program, and emission recall enforcement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 18, 1994, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of New Hampshire (59 FR 36408). The
NPR proposed conditional approval of the New Hampshire enhanced inspection and maintenance program. In response
to the NPR an additional submittal was made by New Hampshire on August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPR identified eight areas which needed to be addressed by New Hampshire. The August 18, 1994 submission by New
Hampshire adequately addressed these areas. Each one is discussed below and the state's response summarized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. Enhanced I/M Performance Standard_Some of the assumptions used by New Hampshire in the MOBILE5a modeling demonstration
needed to be revised. The assumptions for gasoline Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) and vehicle refueling emissions used
in the model program were not the same as those used in the New Hampshire proposed program. The state was also asked to
review the assumptions for compliance and waiver rates and revise them if appropriate. The compliance and waiver
rates are discussed elsewhere in this document. The state revised the assumptions appropriately in the August 18,
1994 submittal, which included a new MOBILE5a modeling demonstration showing that the performance standard will
be met with the proposed New Hampshire program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Network Type and Program Evaluation_The state did not have provisions to bar contractor employees from referring
motorists to particular repair facilities. The state has provided contract language drafted by the New Hampshire
Office of the Attorney General, the substance of which will be included in the final contract, to bar contractor employees
from referring motorists to particular repair facilities and to provide for appropriate penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Vehicle Coverage_The state did not provide adequate information on vehicles subject to the program. In its August
18 submittal, New Hampshire included a table showing the number of subject vehicles by model year and provided information
on exempt vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Quality Control_The state did not address the required quality control manual in sufficient detail. The state
indicated in previous submittals that the quality control manual will be developed by the contractor. The manual
will follow specifications for quality control per EPA's Technical Guidance, and New Hampshire regulations. In
the August 18 submittal, New Hampshire included a table of contents for the manual. Based on these documents, the resulting
quality control manual will meet EPA requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Waiver Rate_The state offered to provide additional guidance on procedures for waiver review, and to reconsider
the 1% waiver rate in the original submittal. The state explained in the August 18 submittal that the present waiver
rate is less than one half of one percent, and that in order to qualify for a waiver, verification of repairs must be done
by a highly trained state referee, and repairs must be performed by a certified mechanic who will have attended up to
120 hours of training. Although New Hampshire does not expect the waiver rate to increase, they increased the rate
in the SIP to 2%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Motorist Compliance Enforcement_The state needed to submit information justifying a 99% compliance rate, describing
the computer matching system, handling of exempt vehicles, fleet vehicles, and tracking of out of state exemptions
and time extensions. In the August 18 submittal, the state described a 12 point enforcement program which will assure
a 99% compliance rate. The state also described the software and hardware upgrades which will be made to the computer
matching system. As part of the Enforcement Compliance Procedures also submitted on August 18, change of status actions,
which could make a previously subject vehicle exempt, must be verified by a Highway Enforcement Officer. Fleet vehicles
must be tested at the contractor facilities and meet the same requirements as other vehicles. A more detailed fleet
plan will be developed as part of the contract. New Hampshire explained that out of state exemptions and time extensions
would be tracked with the computer system, and vehicle owners would be issued registration suspensions when the time
of the extension ran out if the vehicle was not in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Quality Assurance_The state agreed to address certain points in the August 18 submittal. The August 18 submittal
stated that audit reports will be entered onto the host computer of the contractor, and a hard copy of the audit report
will be kept in the stations file in the I/M office. The report filed with the audit results will contain enough evidence
to request an administrative hearing if necessary. Anyone suspected of violating regulations would be targeted
for additional auditing. The DOS intends to assign officers that do not have regular contact with a particular facility
to conduct covert audits. Auditors will receive 128 hours of training at a vocational technical college covering
rules of the program, emission failures and emission repairs. Auditors will also be involved in acceptance testing
of the program and will receive quality assurance, quality control, and equipment training from the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Improving Repair Effectiveness_The state agreed to submit a plan to transmit information to the repair industry.
The August 18 submittal stated that New Hampshire will require the contractor to issue a quarterly newsletter to repair
facilities containing national information and tips, local program changes, training courses, common problems,
diagnostic tips, and other assistance issues.

Conditional Approval
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The August 18, 1994 submittal reaffirmed New Hampshire's commitment to submit by July 29, 1995 revisions addressing
compliance via diagnostic inspection, the inspector penalty schedule, and standards for remote sensing technology.
All three require regulation revisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Compliance via diagnostic inspections were allowed for all model years in the original submission, but in a letter
dated May 19, 1994, the state indicated that it will establish procedures and a policy which will allow compliance
by this mechanism only on 1981 and newer vehicles subject to IM240 tests at final cutpoints or lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The New Hampshire Enhanced I/M Rule, Section 16, does not require imposition of substantial penalties as defined
by EPA's I/M rule (six month suspension) or equivalent retainage on the first offense by inspectors for violations
that directly affect emission reduction benefits. In its letter to EPA dated June 28, 1994 New Hampshire stated that
Section 16 will be revised to be consistent with the penalties required by the EPA rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The state has not established standards for the on-road testing program. In a letter dated May 19, 1994, the state
commits to develop and submit standards to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state has committed, in it's May 19 and June 28, 1994 letters to submitting revisions addressing the three issues
discussed above by July 29, 1995. Section 110(k)(4) of the CAA provides that, if a state fails to comply with its commitment,
such conditional approval will convert to a disapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other specific requirements of EPA's I/M rule and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR
and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36408), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of New Hampshire. The
NPR proposed conditional approval, or in the alternative, disapproval of the New Hampshire I/M SIP submitted by the
State. No public comments were received on the NPR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is conditionally approving the New Hampshire Enhanced Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program as a revision
to the New Hampshire SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted elsewhere in this document, the EPA received no comment on the proposed action. Accordingly, the Regional
Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures published in the
FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214), and revisions to these procedures issued on October 4, 1993, in an EPA memorandum
entitled ``Changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) Tables.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action
from Executive Order 12866 review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that SIP approvals under sections 107, 110 and 172 of the Clean
Air Act will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. SIP approvals (or redesignations)
do not create any new requirements but simply approve requirements that are already state law. SIP approvals (or redesignations),
therefore, do not add any additional requirements for small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State
relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the State actions. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

, 427 U.S. 246, 96 S. Ct. 2518 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the state's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that in the event EPA disapproves the state submittal,
this disapproval action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would
not remove existing state requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision consists
of an emission statement program for stationary sources which emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and/or nitrogen
oxides (NOx) at or above specified actual emission threshold levels. The intended effect of this action is to approve
in the State of Maryland a regulation for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC and /or NOx in
accordance with sections 184(b)(2) and 182(f) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). This action is being taken under
section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 21, 1994 (59 FR 31962), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland. The NPR
proposed approval of the Maryland's Emission Statement Program. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the State
of Maryland on November 13, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maryland's Department of the Environment (MDE) submitted a revision to Maryland's SIP which requires owners of stationary
sources that emit VOCs and/or NOx, above specified actual emission applicability thresholds, to submit annual statements
certifying emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other specific requirements of the SIP revision on Emission Statements and the rationale for EPA's proposed action
are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving amendments to COMAR 26.11.01, General Administrative Procedures, to revise section .01, Definitions,
and to add section .05&hyph;1, Emission Statements, as a revision to the State of Maryland SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the State Implementation Plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action to approve Maryland's Emission Statements Program may not be challenged later
in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, at the request of Ocean Isle Broadcasting Company, allots Channel 228A to Ocean Isle Beach, NC, as
the community's first local aural transmission service. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 4020, January 28, 1994. Channel 228A can be allotted to Ocean Isle Beach in compliance with the Commission's minimum
distance separation requirements, at coordinates 33&hyph;53&hyph;40 North Latitude and 78&hyph;28&hyph;26
West Longitude, with a site restriction of 4.3 kilometers (2.7 miles) west to avoid a short-spacing to vacant but applied-for
Channel 229A at Wrightsville Beach, NC. The allotment at Ocean Isle Beach is short-spaced to the presently licensed
facility of Station WLTT, Channel 228A, Shallotte, NC. However, pursuant to the modification of Station WLTT's license
to specify operation on Channel 279C3, a construction permit specifying the new channel has been granted and the licensee
has now filed an application for license to cover its construction permit (BLH&hyph;940210KA). Final action on a
construction permit application for Channel 228A at Ocean Isle Beach may be withheld pending the licensing of Station
WLTT at the site specified in its construction permit. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OSHA) is issuing a final standard specifying safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements covering all logging operations, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood, chips, etc.). This standard replaces the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard at 29 CFR 1910.266, that had applied only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging, and thereby expands coverage to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection for all employees engaged in logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final standard addresses the unique hazards found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations, and supplements other general industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in 29 CFR part 1910. The final standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthens and further clarifies some provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing standard, and eliminates unnecessary provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised standard also requires training for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in this high risk industry. OSHA believes this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard will significantly decrease the number of employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killed or injured in this industry.

reference of certain publications listed in the standard is

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OSHA) is issuing a final standard detailing safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for logging operations, regardless of the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood, chips, etc.). Logging consists of felling trees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(usually by chain saws), removing the limbs and branches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(limbing), and cutting or splitting the trees into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manageable logs (bucking). Trees and logs are then moved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(yarding) to central locations (landings) by one of several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods (e.g., skidding or forwarding). In relatively flat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terrain, logs are hooked to a tractor and dragged to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing. When terrain is very steep or rough, logs may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transported by steel cables attached to a winching apparatus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(cable yarder) via a system of cables, blocks, pulleys, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriages (cable yarding). Then logs are partially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended and dragged over the ground (high-lead yarding) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoisted into the air and conveyed on overhead cables (sky-line yarding) to the landing. At the landing, logs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanically loaded onto trucks, railroad cars or barges for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport to sawmills. In some cases logs are formed into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
log rafts for transport by water to sawmills. Logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations require employees to work in all types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather, on all types of terrain and in isolated, remote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations. (Logging operations and regional characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed in greater detail in the profile of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry in the Regulatory Impact Analysis.)

II. Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA's existing pulpwood standard was adopted pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1970 (the OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). Section 6(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted OSHA, within two years of the enactment of the OSH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, to promulgate as OSHA standards any existing national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus standard or established Federal standard. At that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the only national consensus standard covering logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations was the American National Standards Institute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard that was limited to pulpwood logging (ANSI O3.1&hyph;1971, Pulpwood Logging Safety Standard) (Ex 2&hyph;13).
OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood standard has remained virtually unchanged since it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was first adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After OSHA adopted the ANSI pulpwood logging standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade associations with interests in the logging of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forest products, such as sawlogs and veneer bolts, joined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ANSI to revise the pulpwood logging standard to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all logging operations within the United States. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded ANSI standard was approved May 19, 1977 (ANSI 03.1&hyph;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1978, Safety Requirements for Logging) (hereafter ``1978 ANSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard'') (Ex. 2&hyph;14). That standard adopted most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safety practices contained in the earlier standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying them to all logging operations throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1978 ANSI logging standard, however, was withdrawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by ANSI in 1984 because no final action was taken to revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reaffirm it. Since ANSI procedures require that action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken to reaffirm, revise, or withdraw a standard no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later than five years after the date of its publication, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1978 ANSI logging standard was withdrawn by default. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently there is no national consensus standard covering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1976, the National Institute for Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety and Health (NIOSH), published a criteria document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommendations For An Occupational Standard For Logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From Felling To First Haul that was applicable to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations (Ex. 4&hyph;3). The NIOSH document addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards and safe work practices involved in felling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bucking, limbing, yarding and loading operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIOSH criteria document differed from OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging standard in several ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The criteria document included all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations such as those relating to sawlogs, veneer bolts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poles and pilings rather than being limited only to pulpwood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It included training requirements for employees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) It did not include provisions dealing with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment protective devices, personnel transport, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-highway truck transport, chipping operations, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and maintenance of roads, trails, and bridges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) It recommended pre-placement and periodic medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final standard for logging operations, as did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's proposed rule, adopts many of the recommendations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NIOSH criteria document, including expansion of coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all logging operations, emphasis on safe work practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and training, and elimination of provisions not unique to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations, such as that involving construction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roads and bridges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six states have promulgated standards covering logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations under the OSH Act State plan procedure set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. &sect;667) and in OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (29 CFR Part 1902), which requires State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to adopt standards which are at least as effective as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those promulgated under section 6 of the OSH Act. 29 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902.03(c). These States, Alaska (Ex. 2&hyph;17), California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;18), Hawaii (Ex. 2&hyph;19), Michigan (Ex. 2&hyph;20), Oregon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;21) and Washington (Ex. 2&hyph;22), have adopted standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provide more protection than OSHA's pulpwood logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard by covering all logging operations within their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. The standards of the five western states also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain a much higher level of detail and specification than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the 1978 ANSI logging standard or OSHA's pulpwood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard. OSHA used these standards as source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents during development of this final standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 2, 1989, OSHA published a notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (NPRM) to amend OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29 CFR 1910.266, to include requirements for all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations (54 FR 18798). Thereafter, on May 11, 1990, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published a notice of hearing in which 10 issues were raised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for additional comment (55 FR 19745). There were 92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments submitted in response to the proposed rule and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Informal public hearings were held on July 24&hyph;25, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Washington, D.C., and on August 21&hyph;23, 1990, in Portland, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR, to allow interested persons who had objections to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to have an opportunity to state those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objections. There were 23 companies, organizations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations and individuals who participated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the close of the hearing Administrative Law Judge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
John M. Vittone established a 60-day post hearing comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, until October 22, 1990, for the submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information and data supplementing the testimony 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided at the hearing. The post-hearing comment period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was followed by another 30 days, until November 21, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for hearing participants to submit final briefs, analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and summations. OSHA received 12 comments during the post-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has considered all evidence, comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony entered into the rulemaking record and presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the public hearing in developing this final standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The safety hazards present in the logging industry are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-known,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and there is no dispute among participants in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking that logging is a high hazard industry (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;10, 2&hyph;30, 5&hyph;18, 38B, 38C). The tools and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment which logging employees use or operate, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saws, axes and tractors, pose hazards wherever they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are utilized in industry. As logging employees use their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tools and equipment, they are dealing with massive weights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and irresistible momentum of falling, rolling, and sliding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees and logs. The hazards are even more acute when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dangerous environmental conditions are factored in, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uneven, unstable or rough terrain; inclement weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including rain, snow, lightning, winds, and extreme cold; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remote and isolated work sites where health care facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not immediately accessible. The combination of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards present a significant risk to employees working in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations throughout the country, regardless of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of timber being logged, where it is logged or the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the wood.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has identified a number of health hazards that are also
present in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;42). According to NIOSH, 20 to 50 percent of employees in felling operations
may be affected by hand-arm vibration syndrome. Logging employees are also exposed to chain-saw exhaust, wood dust,
tree fungi and bacteria. However, NIOSH has said that at this time there is insufficient data to project the magnitude
of risk for some of these potential health hazards. The final rule on logging addresses health hazards, but only in
certain specific ways (e.g., safety and health meetings). However, for those health hazards not specifically addressed
in the logging final rule, other sections of Part 1910 apply. For example, occupational noise exposure is addressed
by 29 CFR 1910.95. A permissible exposure limit for occupational exposure to wood dust is contained in 29 CFR 1910.1000.
OSHA notes that hand-arm vibration, manual lifting and other risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders
are being addressed in OSHA's rulemaking on ergonomic safety and health management.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is also no dispute that these hazards and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting injuries and fatalities are severe and are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the pulpwood sector of the industry (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;48, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65). The 1992 Census of
Fatal Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Injuries, a public report compiled by the Bureau of Labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistics (BLS), indicated there were 158 fatalities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry, which amounts to a 2 in 1,000 risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death each year. The National Institute for Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that there are 16,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensable injuries each year in the logging industry (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37). This amounts to an incidence rate of 1 in every 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(USDA), the accident rate in the logging industry has pushed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers' compensation insurance to 40 percent of payroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs (Ex. 5&hyph;18). The USDA estimates that this now amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $90 million annually in the Pacific Northwest Region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone. According to a study conducted by the Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor Statistics (BLS), as least 47 percent of all injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported occurred in non-pulpwood logging operations (Ex. 2&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion of the accident and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury data shows that injury incidence rate for the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry is among the highest industry incidence rates in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the country.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA looked at several data sources to identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize the degree of risk faced by employees in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry. The data show that the logging industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has one of the highest injury incidence rates. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most recent injury incidence rate for the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry (15.6) compiled by the BLS is almost double the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence rate for the combined private sector (7.9). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging incidence rate was also well above the incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for the manufacturing sector (11.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess the level of risk in logging operations, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relied primarily on the following data sources. These data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources are described and discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistics (BLS) publishes annual reports that list the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates of injuries in the private sector during the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under consideration, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States by Industry (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 2&hyph;2, 2&hyph;3, 2&hyph;4, 2&hyph;5, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;6, 2&hyph;7, 2&hyph;8, 2&hyph;9, 2&hyph;10, 2&hyph;30, 38B and 38C). The data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information are broken down industry by industry according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. The BLS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury reports and data are generated from inquiries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected employers about the OSHA Form 200 (Log and Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 shows BLS occupational injury incidence data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the logging industry for 1972 through 1991. The data in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 were derived from the BLS data using SIC code 241 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Logging Camps and Logging Contractors). While this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification covers the majority of the employees engaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in logging operations, it does not cover loggers employed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mills (SIC 242&hyph;Sawmills and Planing Mills) and other loggers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working for other miscellaneous employers (SIC 24&hyph;Lumber and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wood Products, Except Furniture). Although the incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates for SIC 242 and 24 are very close to the rates for SIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
241, OSHA did not include incidence rates for those SIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codes in its determination of incidence rates for logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because BLS does not provide incidence rates for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational categories within a SIC code. As such, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not able to identify and segregate out the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents which occurred while employees were performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging as opposed to other operations in those related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries. OSHA is aware that there has been a move on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of some mill owners to increasingly use private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors rather than mill employees to harvest the trees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the mills process. OSHA believes, however, that SIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
241 does capture the vast majority of employees performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations. To the extent that some logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations may still be performed by employees in other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIC 241, OSHA does not believe that their accident data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly alter the level of risk present in logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations.

While the injury incidence rate remains high in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry, the BLS data show a steady decrease in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence rate for the industry since the pulpwood logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard was adopted in 1971.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The decrease in incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates occurs in both lost-workday and non-lost-workday cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, the data also show a steady increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average number of lost workdays per case, that indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the severity of injuries has increased over time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
The decrease in injuries since 1971 is also due in part to adoption of comprehensive logging standards by six states.
For example, the state of California, which has a comprehensive standard, reported 457 logging fatalities in the
1950s, prior to adoption of the standard. In 1981, after the logging standard had been promulgated, California's
logging fatalities hit a record low (6 fatalities) (Ex. 2&hyph;11).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The 1991 logging industry incidence rates still remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
far above the total incidence rates and lost-workday incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates for other industries, as Table 2 indicates. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the most recent logging industry incidence rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15.6) is almost double the incidence rate for the private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector combined (7.9). It is also 40 percent higher than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing sector incidence rate (11.2). The logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury incidence rates also are well above the incidence rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the construction industry (12.8) and mining (7.1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries generally considered as high hazard.

The most recent lost-workday incidence rate for logging was 9.9, which is almost double the 5.0 incidence rate in the
manufacturing sector and almost three times the 3.7 incidence rate for the private sector combined. The lost-workday
rate, that is an indicator of the severity of cases, is extremely high in the logging industry (274.8 lost workdays
per 100 full-time workers). It is more than three times the private sector lost-workday rate (79.8) and more than double
the manufacturing lost-workday rate (101.1).

2. Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes an annual Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). The CFOI is
a systematic and verifiable count of fatally injured public and private sector workers. This census uses administrative
records, such as death certificates, workers' compensation fatality claims, medical examiners' records, and other
reports to Federal and State agencies, to identify the workplace fatalities and complete descriptive data on the
workers and circumstances of their deaths. According to the 1992 CFOI, the most recent data available, 158 logging
employees were killed while performing logging operations. Table 3 shows that more than 60 percent were using power
tools and performing cutting activities at the time of their death. Almost 20 percent were killed while operating
logging machines or vehicles.

Applying the CFOI fatality estimate to the most recent logging employment estimate of 72,100 developed for the Regulatory
Impact Analysis (see Section VI of this preamble), the fatality incidence rate is .22. The logging industry fatality
incidence rate is 8.1 times higher than the fatality incidence rate the mining sector (.027), the next closest industrial
division. In addition, the logging fatality rate is 53.6 times higher than the fatality rate for the manufacturing
sector (.0041).

3. BLS Work Injury Report (WIR). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most detailed data source available to the Agency on logging injuries and their causes is a June 1984 BLS Work Injury
Report survey of 1,086 injured logging employees, hereafter referred to as the WIR survey (Ex. 2&hyph;1). It is significant
to note that all 1,086 injuries occurred within just a three-month period.

Not all questions were answered by all survey participants, therefore, total responses vary in each table of data
presented.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in the report are employees who were injured while performing logging activities at the logging site or while
moving or transporting logs across terrain. Motor vehicle accidents were included when the accident occurred at
the work site, while hauling logs to the mill, returning from the mill, or transporting tools, equipment, or workers
to or from the logging site in company-owned vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost one half (47%) of those responding indicated they were performing non-pulpwood logging operations, therefore
they were not covered by OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard. Another 17 percent did not know what type of timber
they were logging.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 OSHA believes it is reasonable to assume that some percentage of those employees were not covered by OSHA's existing
logging standard and therefore, more than one half of the injured employees were not covered by the OSHA standard.
Approximately 35 percent of the injured employees were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.

Of those who responded, 62 percent were engaged in clear cutting, 27 percent in selective cutting, and 8 percent in
salvage logging. Approximately 4 percent did not know the type of logging being conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The survey also contained the following information: (1) the work site where the injury occurred (Table 4); (2) work
activity being performed at the time of the accident (Table 5); (3) causes of the accidents (Table 6); (4) sources of
the accidents (Tables 7&hyph;10); (5) protective equipment in use at the time of the accident (Table 11); (6) safety
features of vehicles or equipments operated at the time of the accident (Table 12); (7) safety training given prior
to the accident (Table 13); (8) factors contributing to the injury (Table 14); (9) severity of the injury (Table 15&hyph;16).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Table 4 shows that more than one-half of employees injured were at cutting sites in the woods, while only 20 percent
were injured at landings. In addition, more than one-half of those injured were working on sloping terrain at the time
and more than 60 percent reported that the work site contained moderate or heavy brush.

Table 5 shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that almost one-half of all injured employees were engaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in cutting activities (felling, limbing, bucking) at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of their accidents, and almost one-fourth of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injured employees were felling trees. Twenty-eight percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the employees were injured during yarding operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(choker setting or hooking up, tractor or cable skidding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chasing). The remainder of the accidents occurred when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logs were being prepared to move from the landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(loading/unloading and rigging) or were being transported to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mill or other final destination. Other unspecified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging activities accounted for eight percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. Finally, servicing and maintaining of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for four percent of the accidents, a figure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with the information found for servicing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance accidents throughout general industry. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket S&hyph;012A.) Table 3 outlines the activity being

sources of injuries into employees hit by trees; injured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slips or falls; while using chain saws; and while operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment or motor vehicles (Tables 7&hyph;10). As Table 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates, almost one-half of those employees injured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees were hit by falling wood.

It should be noted that in a majority of cases where an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee slipped or fell, the fall was due to an uneven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface. Many of these employees lost their balance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those uneven surfaces, such as standing on felled trees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other employees slipped and fell from slippery or loose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bark, sudden shifting of trees or logs, protruding roots, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadwood, leaves, vines, other wood litter and rocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, one-fifth of all employees were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injured while operating chain saws, as shown in Table 9. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these employees, about two-thirds were hurt when the chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw kicked back.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also included in the WIR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey was information about the type of protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment being worn or used at the time of the accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 11 shows that the majority of employees were wearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots, gloves and head protection when they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injured. However, less than one-third of those injured were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearing leg protection, even though almost 60 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries investigated occurred when employees were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing activities that required the use of a chain saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(brushing, felling trees, limbing, and bucking). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, only six of the 33 employees injured while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating equipment or vehicles were using seat belts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since more than one-half of all injured employees said they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were working on sloping terrain at the time, OSHA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is reasonable to assume that some of the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents were rollovers or tipovers and that seat belts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could have prevented some of those injuries.

information on whether employees had received safety

training prior to their accidents. Table 13 indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over one-third of the injured employees had never received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training on safe work practices or in the operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines and vehicles used in logging operations. Only 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of employees injured said they had received training

of the injured employees said that a danger tree had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributed to the accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Human factors also contributed to accidents, according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the injured employees. More than 20 percent said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fast speed at which they had been working contributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their accident. OSHA notes that 10 percent of those injured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were unaware of the hazards when they were injured.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The WIR survey also indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that when employees were injured in logging operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their injuries were more severe than injuries occurring in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other industry sectors. Table 15 shows that almost three- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fourths of those injured missed more than 1 day of work due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their injuries. Over 30 percent missed more than 10 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of work. The average lost-time case resulted in 23 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
away from work. In addition, Table 16 shows that more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-fifth of those injured were hospitalized an average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six nights.

4. OSHA First Reports of Serious Injury (FRSI). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA also utilizes a telephone reporting system for the field staff to inform the national office of the occurrence
of serious or significant accidents. This telephone call system is part of the OSHA emergency communications system.
Regional Administrators are required to file first reports of fatalities, catastrophes and other important events
(such as those that receive significant publicity) to the National Office. The information is recorded on a form entitled
First Report of Serious Accident (FRSI). Approximately 1,200 reports are received by the National Office yearly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the reports are screened prior to OSHA receiving them to eliminate those from a certain industry, occupation
or because of other factors. None of these reports may be considered statistically significant by themselves in attempting
to determine the number of accidents that have occurred. However, they do give an indication of where many serious
accidents have occurred and the types of work being performed at the time of the accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has examined the FRSI reports and identified 105 (Ex. 4&hyph;65) that occurred while employees were performing
logging operations. These accidents occurred between October 1985 and December 1989. Table 17 lists the logging
accident reports as a percentage of all accident reports received.

The percentages attributable to logging injuries are particularly large in relation to the total employment in the
industries represented. Using employment rates for 1985&hyph;1989 for the private sector and for the logging industry,
OSHA observes that the percentage of accidents recorded on the FRSI for logging for each year far exceeded the percentage
of employees in logging compared with the private sector. Whereas, logging employment constituted one tenth of one
percent of total private sector employment, the reports of serious accidents in logging averaged about two percent
of the total accidents. Table 18 lists these employment rates as they appear in the BLS annual reports entitled, Occupational
Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, (followed by the year of the data). (See section A above.)

OSHA was also able to identify from the FRSI reports the activity that was being conducted at the time of the accident
and the causes of the accidents. For example, more than one-half were involved in cutting activities when they were
seriously injured. OSHA also notes that almost nine percent were seriously injured in machine rollover or tipover
accidents while only 1 employee was injured by a jillpoke. Table 19 lists the activity being conducted or the causes
of the accidents.

5. OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe Investigations Report (FCI).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA regulations require that all workplace fatalities be reported to the nearest OSHA Area Office. Employers are
required to complete a Fatality/Catastrophe Event Report Form (OSHA 36), which is reviewed by the OSHA Area Director
to determine whether an investigation of the fatality is warranted. In 1989, OSHA published a study of 141 logging
fatalities that occurred during the period of 1978&hyph;84 (Ex. 4&hyph;61). These fatalities do not represent all
logging industry fatalities during that time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the study, 71 percent of those logging employees killed were out in the cutting area. Only one percent
each were killed on skid trails or at landings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study also indicated that 43 percent of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killed were felling trees at the time. Employees performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yarding and bucking and limbing operations each accounted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 13 percent of the fatalities. The overwhelming majority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of employees (72%) were killed when they were struck or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crushed by a tree, log or limb, while 17 percent were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in machine accidents. One percent were killed in chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unsafe work practices, misjudgments and lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training or supervision accounted for 42 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities while less than one percent were due to equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics (Maine BLS) has compiled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various statistics on injuries and fatalities in the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry (Ex. 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;175, 4&hyph;176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine BLS conducted a detailed survey of 189 logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee injuries that occurred between May and July of 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 4&hyph;175). This number does not represent all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who were injured during that period. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this survey, 35 percent of employees reporting injuries were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
struck by trees, logs or limbs. Chain-saw accidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for 26 percent of the reported injuries while 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the logging employees were injured in slips or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Maine BLS, the category that showed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly higher than average percentage of disabling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries was chain-saw accidents. Over one-half of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw accidents involved kickback. In over 70 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the kickback accidents, the chain saws were equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brakes. Maine BLS said that chain brakes had played a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant role in lessening the effects of the injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Less than 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes were present resulted in hospitalization, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearly 50 percent of the accidents involving other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saws resulted in hospitalization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This survey also indicates that two-thirds of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging accidents resulted in lost workdays and 13 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all injuries required at least one overnight in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital. The average hospitalization was for five days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine BLS has also compiled statistics from 1980&hyph;87 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw injuries that resulted in a first report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious injury (Ex. 4&hyph;176). According to this report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average chain-saw injuries for each year was 362. Of those, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an average of 237 (65%) were disabling injuries, that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries which result in lost workdays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine BLS has also examined disabling logging injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported from 1985&hyph;87 that had resulted in lacerations (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4&hyph;174). During those three years, there were an average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
183 disabling lacerations each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

7. Washington State Logging Fatalities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study has been compiled on logging fatalities in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Washington from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Of the 135 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities that occurred during those years, the study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed 92 percent of them. Death certificates and reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of investigations by Washington OSHA were used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to this study, the overall annual fatality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for logging during this period was approximately 2 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,000 full-time employees. Those employees who were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had a mean length of experience in the logging industry of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.6 years. Less than 10 percent had less than one year's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More than 40 percent of all loggers killed were engaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in felling activities, while 23 percent were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing yarding operations. Almost 20 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers were operating logging machines at the time of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident. Table 20 shows the jobs employees were performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of their accident.

More than 65 percent of all employees killed were hit or crushed by a log or tree. While most of these employees who were
hit or crushed by a tree were the result of their own activity, more than eight percent were hit by trees being felled
by another employee. Approximately nine percent were killed in machine rollover accidents, while 10 percent of those
employees killed were struck by a machine or vehicle. Table 21 shows the causes of the accidents in which loggers were
killed.

According to the study, accident investigation reports indicted that many of the deaths would not have occurred if
the employees had been following safe work practices and had remained out of hazardous areas (e.g., other occupied
work areas).

C. Need for agency action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
OSHA believes that current logging methods and the inherent dangers posed by work in the woods, such as those caused
by inclement weather, uneven terrain and isolation from health care facilities, present significant hazards to
employees engaged in logging operations across the nation, regardless of the type logging being conducted or the
end use of the wood. The presentation of data in the preceding section further demonstrate the level of risk to which
all loggers are exposed. Nevertheless, the existing OSHA safety standard for pulpwood logging (29 CFR 1910.266)
specifically addresses only one segment of the logging industry_logging operations whose forest product ends up
as pulp. Although OSHA does not know precisely the breakdown of employment and occupational injuries between pulpwood
and other logging operations, the data and other information available to OSHA indicate that similar hazards exist
in both sectors of the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preceding section has shown that the logging industry remains a high risk industry, regardless of the end use of
the forest product. In particular, the data show: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Employees engaged in logging operations have a substantially higher risk of injury and death than workers in many
other industries, including other high hazard industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If they are injured, loggers are more likely to be hospitalized and lose workdays compared to employees in most other
industries, as evidenced by the very high lost-workday incidence rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. When loggers are injured, their injuries are much more severe and result in longer hospitalizations and more lost
time per employee than do the injuries of employees in most other industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Loggers also have a much higher incidence of fatalities than employees in other industries.

In addition, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final logging standard estimates, based on the various data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the record, that there are an average of 158 fatalities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6,798 lost workday injuries and 3,770 non-lost workday 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. (For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further discussion see section VI of this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined by the final rule, only 38 percent (27,170) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by State Plan State logging standards,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently provide protection regardless of kind of logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in which the loggers are employed. Of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated 62 percent (44,930) of logging employees who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not covered by State plan State standards, OSHA estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that at only one-third (16,478) are covered by the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging standard. That means that almost two-thirds (28,452) are not covered by any Federal or State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard. (This estimate is consistent with the WIR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey, which indicated that only 35 percent of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.)

In 1977, the leading states in logging employment (with 48 percent of the total) were Washington (15, 400), Oregon
(14,000), California (6,100) and Maine (4,300). By 1982, the employment pattern had shifted and the leading states
(with 42 percent of the total) were Washington (11,900, down 3,500); Oregon (11,300, down 2,700); Georgia (5,400,
up 1,600); and Alabama (5,000, up 1,200). California (3,900, down 2,200), was no longer one of the leaders. Overall
logging employment in the Pacific Coast states decreased 22% during this period. The South was the only region in the
country to show an increase in logging employment (21%). This employment trend, resulting in the change from harvesting
the Pacific Coast's old-growth timber to increased harvesting of third and forth-growth pine forests in the south,
means that an increasing proportion of logging employment is in states not covered by state logging standards. (As
noted earlier, only Alaska (16th in 1982), California (7th), Hawaii (very small), Michigan (19th), Oregon (2nd)
and Washington (1st) have OSHA approved state logging standards covering all loggers.) This means that as the centers
of activity (and employment) shift from the old growth forests of the pacific coast to the pine forests of the south,
fewer employees conducting general logging (non-pulpwood logging) will be covered by these State plan State logging
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The preceding section shows there has been a steady 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease in injury and lost-workday incidence rates since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adoption of OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the State plan State standards. In addition to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further reduction in accidents for those employers currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by OSHA and State logging standards, OSHA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a substantial reduction in incidence rates can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved by promulgating a uniform national logging standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provides protection for all employees engaged in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the proposed rule, OSHA used the l978 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI standard as its model for a uniform national logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, since many of its requirements were stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance language. This is in keeping with the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that properly drafted performance standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can adequately address safety and health hazards without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily impeding technological advancement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer innovation. The final rule provides a base level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety for employees in all logging operations. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same time, it still allows those State plan States with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicated or specialized local conditions to develop their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own detailed standards, as several States have already done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many participants in this rulemaking have said that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive performance-based logging standard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to reduce the risk of injury and death (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tr. W1 21, 73, 202). OSHA agrees with these commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the integrated program of personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective equipment; equipment, machine and vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective devices, inspection and maintenance; work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices; and training contained in the final rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably necessary and appropriate to reduce the high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury and fatality incidence rates in this industry.

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As a result of issues raised by those commenting on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed logging standard, OSHA solicited information on 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major issues in the notice of public hearing (55 FR 19745, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 11, 1990). OSHA requested detailed information on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety of issues including training, personal protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, first aid, chain-saw protective devices, and seat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belts. These issues were discussed by the participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the public hearings and in post-hearing comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evidence submitted to the record is summarized and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated in the following discussion of each issue and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the summary and explanation of the final rule.

1. Training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed rule generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported the need for training. Several commenters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, raised specific questions about particular training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues. As a result, OSHA requested in the hearing notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further comment on the following training issues: Effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of training, sufficiency of training, and portability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Effective date for training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA would have required employers to be in compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all provisions of the final logging standard within 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of publication of the rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule did not provide extended compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers to familiarize themselves with the standard and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop and conduct training. Some commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional time to meet the training requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule was unnecessary (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. OR 343). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said that in many logging establishments training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is already being provided and that employers would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require significant time to incorporate the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirements into their ongoing programs. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other commenters argued that the effective date for training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be delayed because additional time was necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop the required training program and to train employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;2, 5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;2; Tr. W2 243&hyph;44). Commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed various effective dates for training. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Northeastern Loggers Association, Inc., recommended a 2-year phase-in of the training requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;2).
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Pulpwood Association, Inc. (APA), however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported a shorter six-month phase-in period:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Safety training programs for loggers are largely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific to a function (for example, proper felling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique). A fully comprehensive training package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have to be developed to meet the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. APA is attempting to develop training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and have them available by the end of 1989.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* APA will seek OSHA staff review of its
training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program as it is developed. We'd like a brief delay in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement, just long enough for us to have something 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for employers (Ex. 5&hyph;27). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the hearing there was little testimony about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delaying the effective date for training. Mr. Doug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domenech, testifying on behalf of APA, repeated APA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position that employers should be given some additional time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with training requirements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The training is a very needed thing and, unfortunately, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we just don't have the infrastructure to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. That's why *&blank;*&blank;* we *&blank;*&blank;* hope that OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will give some kind of variance on time before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citations are delivered because it's just not out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there. If loggers had to comply with a training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement today, they'd all be cited (Tr. W2 243&hyph;44).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, however, Mr. Alex Hansen, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Associated Oregon Loggers, Inc. (AOL), testified that Oregon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers already were in compliance with the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions contained in the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As far as we're concerned in Oregon, you could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the training tomorrow. We already have it in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. We don't have a problem with it. We're 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocates of safety training in the woods. I know some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other states have some problems. They haven't been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doing it or maybe not as strenuous as the Oregon rules, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and I understand their problems, but as far as our association is concerned, if you pass it tomorrow, we're in compliance
(Tr. OR 343).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record indicates that training materials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses for logging safety are widely available and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many logging establishments have implemented training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;181, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;33, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6,
36; Tr. W1 163&hyph;64, W2 113, 115, 125, 199&hyph;201, OR 87, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
259&hyph;60, 393, 546&hyph;47, 566). Trade associations such as AOL, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APA and the Montana Logging Association have been providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training materials on an on-going basis (Ex. 5&hyph;27). APA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to have completed a comprehensive training package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for its members companies by 1989. In addition, state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural extension services are a source of training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123). Several hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants submitted descriptions of their training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and the actual training materials (Ex. 21, 22, 23, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24, 26, 28, 29). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware that many of the existing training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs are based on the training requirements of OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging standard. Because the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements have been revised in this final rule, current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs will have to be reviewed and upgraded, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when necessary, to meet the revised requirements. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the training provisions of the final rule vary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some degree from the proposed rule. As such, employers who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made changes in their programs in response to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule will have to review their training materials to assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware that employers, trade associations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other organizations that provide training will need time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare and/or update training programs to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the final rule and will need time to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training to employees. However, the record also shows that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many companies and organizations already have developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs that meet most of the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69, 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR 343). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many establishments, especially those in States that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standards, already are providing training (Ex. 21, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29). Therefore, OSHA does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a lengthy delay is necessary to meet the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the final rule. The Agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extending the effective date of the standard for 120 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be sufficient to allow employers and others to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiarize themselves with the final rule, to update 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs to meet the provisions of the final rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to conduct initial training. This phase-in period also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will give employers time to determine whether current and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new employees have received the training in all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements specified in this section or whether they will need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Sufficiency of training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second issue raised in the hearing notice concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what training OSHA would consider sufficient to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirements in the final rule. Some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported OSHA's preference for performance based training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;15). Other commenters argued for detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications to be included in the training requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including a minimum number of hours of training (Ex. 9&hyph;13, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the final rule contains training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in performance language to allow employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility in tailoring training programs to the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances under which they operate. The final rule sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth the basic elements that must be covered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer's training program, such as safe performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned work tasks; safe use of tools; recognition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of workplace hazards; prevention and control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general logging hazards; and the requirements of the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. The training provisions also require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees initially work under supervision and that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate the ability to perform their work tasks safely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before being released from supervision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, each logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment has unique conditions or hazards associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with its logging operations, that result in unique methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operation. OSHA believes that the general elements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the training provisions allow employers to take into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those differences while still requiring the employer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure through training that each employee is able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform the job safely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of information submitted to the record and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testimony presented during the hearings, OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that employers will not have difficulty in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complying with the training requirements of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the performance-based elements adopted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule will enhance employee safety and will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees with the tools to permit them to actively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in providing their own protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Industrial Truck Association (ITA) recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA specify in greater detail the training required for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial truck operators (Ex. W1 5&hyph;47, Tr. 221&hyph;27). ITA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged OSHA to adopt the training provisions from the ASME 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B56.6 standard on rough-terrain forklift trucks. Mr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
William Montweiler, testifying for ITA, stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Part Two of the B56.6 standard addresses general safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and operating practices that are highly relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule's training provisions. Although ITA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pleased that the proposed rule's training provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide greater detail than OSHA's industrial truck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, these provisions can be made still more effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by additional particularity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule merely requires that employees be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained to recognize safety hazards and trained ``in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe use or maintenance of any machinery, equipment, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tools that they may be required to operate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain.'' This directive, we feel, is inadequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it fails to state the elements that comprise an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By contrast, paragraph 5.17.4 of the B56.6 voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard lists numerous elements of a proper training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program specific to rough-terrain forklift truck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, including explanation of the safety-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of truck and component design; location and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of controls; supervised practice; oral, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written, and operational performance testing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refresher courses. ITA requests, therefore, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final logging operations rule incorporate the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions contained in the B56.6 standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that the performance-based and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competency-based training provisions contained in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard adequately address ITA's concerns, and that more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific requirements in this standard for forklift truck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator training are not warranted for several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the record indicates there is not a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of rough-terrain industrial trucks used in logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. Mr. Richard Lewis, testifying on behalf of APA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed the limited use of rough-terrain industrial trucks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the logging industry:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Pulpwood Association currently employs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven technically trained foresters, two in Washington 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and five in division offices throughout the U.S. And 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collectively we've worked in the field for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 103 man years, and we get out on logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations every month and sometimes once a week, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have never, never observed the use of a rough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terrain fork lift in a logging operation (Tr. OR 478&hyph;79 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the ASME standard to which ITA refers, B56.6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not focus on any unique problems with the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial trucks in logging operations. Conversely, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard is intended primarily to deal with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace hazards that are unique to logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in any event, the final standard achieves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same training outcome as the B56.6 standard: demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to safely operate a rough-terrain industrial truck.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is in agreement with ITA that safety in industrial truck operation is important in the logging industry as well
as all other industries. OSHA believes that the issue of training of industrial truck operators is more appropriately
addressed in more detail in OSHA's forthcoming proposed standard on industrial truck operator training. OSHA believes
the major safety issues involving industrial truck operation can be fully and specifically examined and addressed
in that rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Portability of training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third issue raised regarding training involves the portability of training; that is, whether current and new
employees who are experienced and previously trained must receive additional or supplemental training. The proposed
rule would have required that each new employee be trained, regardless of whether he/she had been trained previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;13). Several commenters
disagreed with the scope of employees that need training, stating that trained and experienced loggers should not
require the same training as an inexperienced new employee (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 9&hyph;2; Tr.
W1 63, OR 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that training is important for all loggers regardless of whether they have no logging experience or
have many years of experience. The need to provide training for even experienced loggers is buttressed by the WIR survey
of injured loggers, which indicated that over one third of those injured had never received training (Ex. 2&hyph;1).
In addition, more than 60 percent of those injured had worked 5 years or more in the logging industry. In fact, only 22
percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, OSHA does not want to penalize those employers who already have instituted training programs that
meet the requirements of the final rule or can easily be brought into compliance with the final rule. In addition, OSHA
does not want to impose an unnecessary burden on an employer who hires loggers who have received the training required
by this section on a prior job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to eliminate unnecessary duplication of training in the final rule, OSHA is not requiring employers to retrain
employees who have received training in the specific requirements of this section. The final rule only requires the
employer to train employees in those elements in which the current or new employee has not been trained. For example,
an employee may need to be trained to recognize hazards that are specific to the terrain in which the work is being done,
and to utilize safe work practices to avoid or control these hazards. In addition, a new employee, even if experienced
in logging operations, may not be familiar with various work site procedures of the new employer, such as signals to
be used. It is important for new employees to be brought up to speed with the current logging practices so other members
of the logging crew are not placed at risk by the actions or inactions of the new employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included in the final rule a provision that each new employee and each employee who must be trained work under
the supervision of a designated person until they can demonstrate the ability to perform their new duties safely.
OSHA's position on the supervision requirement was supported by various hearing participants. For example, various
witnesses at the hearing noted that close supervision of new employees, regardless of their experience, is a widely
accepted practice in the logging industry and a means of determining whether the employee's previous training was
adequate (Tr. W1 91&hyph;92, OR 95&hyph;97, 204&hyph;05, 275&hyph;76, 374, 456&hyph;57, 635&hyph;36). As such,
OSHA believes that the inclusion of the supervision requirement in the final rule will provide the necessary safety
to both the new and current employee, and will not impose a significant burden on the employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Personal protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA raised the issue about who should pay for personal protective equipment (PPE) that employees
are required to use or wear. The Agency proposed that employers 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
provide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE and assure it is used by employees when required. OSHA's intent in the proposed rule was that the employer provide
personal equipment at no cost to the employee. PPE items included in the proposed rule were gloves, leg protection,
logging boots, safety helmets (hard hats), eye or face protection, and respiratory protection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters agreed that the personal protective equipment specified in the proposed rule should be used. (Ex.
5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;64, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;20). Some commenters urged OSHA to require
that the employer be responsible for providing all PPE (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13). They said that only if the employer
provided the PPE could he assure its quality, design and maintenance. However, many other commenters opposed requiring
logging employers to provide certain types of PPE, and their opposition focused primarily on logging boots (Ex. 5&hyph;11,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5,
9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;17, 9&hyph;18; Tr. W1 74&hyph;75, 110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Many commenters
did not give any reason why the employer should not be required to pay for PPE. Other commenters contended primarily
that employers would be financially burdened if they had to pay for certain high cost PPE, such as individually-fitted
and non-reusable logging boots, in an industry that has such a high turnover rate. Other reasons for not requiring
the employer to provide certain types of PPE were the use of certain PPE by employees outside the workplace, and industry
custom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters noted that employee turnover in the logging industry is very high (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39,
5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;56, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;65, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 74&hyph;75,
110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Some commenters also indicated that employees sometimes work only
one or two weeks before leaving, often taking jobs at another logging establishment (Ex. 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92; Tr. OR 78). These commenters argued that it would be unfair to require employers to pay for expensive logging
boots given the high turnover rate of the logging industry. One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[I]t frightens us to think that we might be providing a $300 pair of boots for a man that's there a week (Tr. W1 74). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These commenters also contend that for some PPE, particularly logging boots, employers might have to buy new PPE every
time they hire a new employee. First, this would be necessary because terminated employees do not return PPE they are
issued (Ex. 5&hyph;45). Second, these commenters argue that, unlike PPE such as ear muffs and head and leg protection,
logging boots are an item of PPE that cannot be reused by other employees because of size and hygienic concerns (Ex.
5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;21; Tr.
OR 78). Because logging boots cannot be worn by other employees, these commenters said employers view logging boots
as ``personal clothing.'' In addition, these commenters said that even if employees did return their logging boots,
new employees would be unwilling to wear used logging boots. One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Suppose a new employee comes to work in the spring and finds he can't or doesn't want to be a logger so he hands in his $200
boots with two weeks wear and tear and leaves. Is the next guy going to accept ``used'' boots someone else wore? (Ex.
5&hyph;78) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters said that requiring employers to pay for new PPE, primarily logging boots, for each new employee would
place a considerable financial burden on employers (Ex. 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 74,
OR 78, 350). They said the cost would be particularly burdensome for small establishments that comprise the vast majority
of the logging industry. Their basis for this conclusion is that logging boots are very costly, ranging from $60 to
$400 a pair (Ex. 5&hyph;45, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 74, OR 78, 350). In addition, they said employees need two to three pairs
of logging boots a year. The commenters, however, did not present any financial or economic evidence as to the burden
(e.g., effect on profits, sales, etc.) on the industry as a whole, and particularly small employers as a group, of providing
logging boots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said employers should not be required to pay for logging boots that are used by employees away from workplace
(Ex. 5&hyph;39). This commenter said employees take their logging boots with them when they seek new employment (Ex.
5&hyph;39). He also said employees use their logging boots for hunting and cutting their own wood (Ex. 5&hyph;39).
In contrast, the record shows that other types of PPE (e.g., leg protection, safety glasses and hearing protection)
remain with the employer, therefore, they are not used away from the workplace (e.g., Ex. 5&hyph;32). In addition,
one commenter said that these types of PPE are already being provided by many establishments as standard industry
practice (Ex. 5&hyph;32).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, several commenters said that employers should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be required to pay for certain PPE because the custom in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the logging industry is that employees, especially piece-rate workers, provide their own PPE, particularly logging

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;24, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters said that piece-rate workers provide all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tools of the trade,'' that includes some types of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the record also shows that some logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments do provide logging boots (Ex. 5&hyph;32; Tr. W1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
177). For example, one commenter said:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he way we set it up is that when you're with us 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for one year we will buy you three pair of boots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and we will supply all safety equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After you are with us for one month, we will supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety chaps, the helmet, the whole works. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day you come on the job we will supply the helmet, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helmet with the eye protection and the ear protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. W1 177). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most instances items such as ear plugs, safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glasses, bucking chaps or any other safety item 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to work in a safe environment are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided (Ex. 5&hyph;32).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has carefully reviewed the evidence in the record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delete the general requirement that the employer be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide logging boots. However, the final rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that such boots be worn by logging employees, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holds the employer responsible for assuring that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee has logging boots and wears them. As to the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPE requirements specified in paragraph (d), OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained the language of the pulpwood logging and proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that the employer provide such PPE at no cost to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act imposes on employers the responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with standards and for providing safe working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for employees. This responsibility has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized in OSHA's personal protective equipment standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 29 CFR 1910.132 through 29 CFR 1910.138. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1910.132(a) establishes the employer's obligation to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintain personal protective equipment whenever such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment is necessary by reason of the hazards in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1910.132(b) does recognize that in some limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances that employees may provide their own PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, OSHA emphasizes that this practice is not the norm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but rather an exception based on unusual or specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. In addition, section 1910.132(b) underscores 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer's continuing obligation to assure the adequacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintenance of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record shows that special circumstances exist in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the logging industry which may make it appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees to provide their own logging boots. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record shows that the logging industry is highly transient, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that logging boots, unlike other PPE required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, are not the kind of PPE that can be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Logging boots purchased to fit one employee may not fit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next employee. It is important that logging boots fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly or the boot may not provide the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. Therefore, based on current turnover rates in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry, employers would have to purchase non-reusable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots costing $200 to $400 many times a year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly-hired employees, even though there is a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood that these employees will remain in the job for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only a short time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the record shows that logging employees tend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
move from one logging establishment to another, taking their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tools of the trade'' with them, particularly their logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots. OSHA believes it may be appropriate in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation to allow employees to take their logging boots to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next place of employment, rather than requiring the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer to provide logging boots. Logging boots are both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portable (i.e., not limited in use to or maintained at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular workplace, like respirators for instance) and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most cases they fit only that particular employee therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they cannot be reused by other employees. The other items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PPE required by the final rule, such as leg and head

readily used by other employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, there is evidence in the record that employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do use their logging boots away from work. Employees come 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to and leave work wearing their logging boots, suggesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the boots are used away from the workplace. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, commenters cited specific activities where logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots are used away from the logging work site. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters did not provide any comparable evidence that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other items of PPE required by the final rule are also used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by employees away from the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, OSHA has decided in the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to require the employer to provide logging boots. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency emphasizes that it is the totality of the special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances in the logging industry that justify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. Of the reasons discussed above, none of them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standing alone would provide sufficient justification for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departing from the general requirement that employers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide PPE. Rather, it is the combination of these reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and special circumstances in the logging industry that make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it appropriate to allow employees to provide their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also emphasizes that regardless of who provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the logging boots, the final rule makes the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for assuring that logging boots are used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee and are maintained in a serviceable condition. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, in the final rule the employer is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuring that logging boots are inspected before initial use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a workshift. Attendant to this requirement, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer is also responsible for assuring that damaged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defective equipment is either repaired or replaced before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work is commenced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the other items of PPE required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, OSHA does not believe there is sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence in the record to justify a departure from OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-established policy. Neither industry practice nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turnover rates compel the Agency to relieve employers of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to pay for the other items of PPE for loggers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, evidence in the record shows that many employers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently providing these other items of PPE (Ex. 5&hyph;32, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 177). The record shows that, unlike
logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots, these items of PPE tend to remain at the workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are amenable for use by other employees. Further, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no evidence in the record of an established practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees using such PPE away from the workplace. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no evidence of established and uniform industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of transporting such PPE from job to job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in the final rule, OSHA is requiring, except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots, that the employer provide PPE at no cost to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employee.

3. Leg protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the hearing notice OSHA raised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three issues concerning leg protection for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators: specifications for leg protection, the area to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be protected, and potential disadvantages of leg protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Specifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required that chain-saw operators wear leg protection made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ballistic nylon or other material that provides at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent protection. Many commenters supported the leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection requirement for chain-saw operators (Ex. 5&hyph;5, 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;42,
5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;73, 9&hyph;9&hyph;11; Tr. W2 126&hyph;28). Several commenters
and hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants also supported OSHA's position that leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection meet certain criteria (Ex. 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;73; Tr. W2 126&hyph;28). Two commenters
suggested that OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require leg protection made with KEVLAR because they believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KEVLAR provides more protection than ballistic nylon (Ex. 5&hyph;5, 5&hyph;30). One of these commenters said KEVLAR
leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection provides 50 percent more protection than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballistic nylon with a fraction of the weight and bulk, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing easier movement and reducing fatigue (Ex. 5&hyph;30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also said that the U.S. Forest Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications call for KEVLAR leg protection. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters stated that a testing protocol for leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be adopted rather than specifying that leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be comprised of any certain type of material (Ex. 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;72). One commenter said OSHA should
adopt the ISO or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadian testing standards for leg protection (Ex. 9&hyph;16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other commenters said there was no consensus in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this country regarding an appropriate testing standard (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;72). One commenter proposed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following testing standard be adopted:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he protective garment must have a minimum ``Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chain Speed'' of 2500 feet per minute for operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using chain saws with an engine displacement of under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65 cc and 3000 feet per minute for operators using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saws with an engine displacement of over 65 cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further the test procedure developed and currently used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the US Forest Service [should] be adopted and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as the test method used to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Threshold Chain Speed'' of safety material (Ex. 5&hyph;68).

Another commenter proposed that a different testing

standard be adopted in OSHA's final rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other participants opposed specific criteria for leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection performance for several reasons (Tr. W2 206&hyph;07, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 472&hyph;75, 496&hyph;98, 513&hyph;14). First, some argued that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were no national consensus or State standard to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on specification standards. Second, others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commented that a specification standard limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``ballistic nylon'' was too restrictive (Ex. 5&hyph;30; Tr. W2 189&hyph;90). Third, others stated that there are
no standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing specific performance criteria of the material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for leg protection. For example, APA testified:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
APA does not know of any state leg protection apparel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard in existence or under development. I can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to you that our association has a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee working on the development of a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparel standard, and this committee has generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted the Quebec Research Institute testing method, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and now it's kind of rewriting this testing method to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the American Society of Testing Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines. So the committee is close to completing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its work on endorsing an approved test procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in the committee's charge is to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary performance testing standard that would apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for leg protection, safety boots and other apparel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That's going to be a little way down the road. It's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own opinion that the work of this committee is not yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mature and that OSHA should probably not attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include any specific performance testing standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection or other safety items at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They're recommending that you defer the inclusion of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific leg protection performance testing standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the next revision of the OSHA logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, whenever that might be. It may be ten 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years from now or fifteen years from now. At this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point in time, we feel it's much more important to get 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any safety equipment worn, rather than to worry about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not it meets specific performance standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. OR 472&hyph;75).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APA also testified that regional differences in chain-saw operations also precludes a specification standard for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I would also say in general our feeling is that logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is so different obviously in every part of the country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that often we've got to have lead-way for the types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection that might be appropriate for a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working in the swamps of Louisiana as opposed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mountains of Montana. Not that we know what those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences might be, but that in general we feel like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loggers in those areas should be able to have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to design or approve a leg protection that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be appropriate for their situation (Tr. OR 207&hyph;08).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record shows that leg protection for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is essential to prevent injuries. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the WIR survey, 64 percent of injuries to chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators were due to kickback, an accident that usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in injury to the leg (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The WIR survey also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that 22 percent of all injuries reported were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the leg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that leg protection made of ballistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nylon or equivalent material is effective in preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries to the leg. A study by the French Farmers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mutuality indicates that ballistic leg protection was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective in preventing 12 leg injuries in 91 loggers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies over an eight-month period (Ex. 37). Testimony and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments show, however, that there is no accepted testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements standard in this country on leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. In addition, the foreign standards that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist have not been generally accepted or used in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country. Nonetheless, OSHA believes that a performance-based requirement for leg protection to provide protection

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against contact with a moving saw chain will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility for employers while encouraging technological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovation, such as the work by APA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For these reasons, in the final rule OSHA has adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed provision requiring that leg protection be worn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on each leg by all chain-saw operators. However, OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised the final rule to require that where the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides leg protection made of material other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballistic nylon, the employer is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating that it provides protection which is at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to ballistic nylon, such as KEVLAR. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement ensures that employees are protected against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moving saw chains, while at the same time providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility for the employer.

b. Area to be protected and disadvantages of leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The other issues raised regarding leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection concerned the parts of the chain-saw operator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body that should be covered and its effect on mobility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other potential safety disadvantages of wearing leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule specified that leg protection extend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the upper thigh to the boot or shoe top. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters supported the proposed rule (Ex. 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;11, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;20). One commenter said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule followed the requirements of the European 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft standard (Ex. 9&hyph;11B). Some commenters said the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule was not protective enough and said the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment for protecting chain-saw operators should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded (Ex. 5&hyph;14, 5&hyph;68). One of these commenters said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e would recommend that a standard be developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defining the minimum coverage these garments should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have, for example from crotch to ankle bone with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum width measured at the knee of 9.5 (Ex. 5&hyph;68). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other commenter recommended leg protection be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended to also provide foot protection that is cut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance to a chain saw (Ex. 5&hyph;14). This commenter said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the additional foot covering protection would also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure that the entire leg and ankle were covered if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chaps were not long enough to cover the boot top. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters, however, said leg protection should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be limited in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;56, 5&hyph;65, 9&hyph;1; Tr. OR 227, 633&hyph;34).
Most of these commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA should not require leg protection to extend from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upper thigh to the boot or shoe top. First, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said that extending leg protection from the thigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the boot or shoe top was not necessary because most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the injuries occur to the area around the knee. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, one commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person using a chain saw would have to do some pretty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectacular gymnastics to receive a chain saw cut more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 4
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; below the knee. Once again, we have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordable injuries for the last 7 years involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saw cuts more than 4
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; below the knee (Ex. 5&hyph;45).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter stated that leg protection was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for climbers and bucket truck operators: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The major hazards for these individuals are cuts to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upper body from saw kick-backs and falling material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leg protection should not be required, however the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of some of the new lighter and more pliable pads sewn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into pants should be encouraged whenever feasible (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;19).

Second, commenters stated that the small risk of injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the lower leg was outweighed by the risks due to lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mobility caused by full-length leg protection. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one said:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We have received numerous comments from our membership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the country who use leg protection (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chaps) suggesting that chaps only extend to just below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee. Chaps that extend to the boot top, or shoe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
top, as required in proposed Section (e)(1)(ii), impede 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mobility and cause a greater safety hazard than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard works to protect against. Our members believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the highest risk for chain saw cuts occurs from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee to the thigh. Thus, chaps that cover the leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the upper thigh to just below the knee are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient (Ex. 5&hyph;56). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, one commenter testified that leg protection to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boot or shoe top would pose an unreasonable financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden on employers (Tr. OR 633&hyph;34). According to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant, different loggers use the employer-provided leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection each day. Because all loggers are not the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
height, the leg protection provided may not reach to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boot or shoe top or may be too long for other loggers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear safely. This participant suggested that the only way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an employer could guarantee compliance with the required fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the leg protection would be to provide fitted leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to each individual logger. The participant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended the following: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We suggest [leg protection extend] to below the knee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these come in various lengths. And certainly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in those times you can't always stretch a pair of chaps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that somebody maybe having to put on to operate a chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw all of a sudden to get it down to the boot top (Tr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 633&hyph;34).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, some commenters stated that leg protection that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extends to the boot or shoe top might cause mobility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems, and would therefore be hazardous for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;55). For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Rigging crews will occasionally use a power saw. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are required to wear leggings, it could be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dangerous than not having anything. This is one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons rigging crews prefer suspenders rather than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belt because you don't get ``hung up'' so often. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anything that is going to hinder mobility is a problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;20). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter recommended that OSHA limit leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to just one leg for cutters (i.e., the leg in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front that is used to maintain balance during cutting) (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;65). However, this commenter also admitted that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw operator who is clearing brush needs to wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection on both legs because the saw is continuously and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perilously close to either leg at all times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said leg protection should be limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because heat and humidity could increase worker fatigue or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause problems that might exceed the benefits of leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection (Ex. 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;59, Tr. W2 206&hyph;07). For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, one commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA proposes that employees are assigned duties that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an operator of a chain saw to wear ballistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nylon or equivalent protection that must cover each leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the upper thigh to the boot top. This does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into consideration the various temperature factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could increase fatigue. Fatigue is a major cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of injuries. As stated, on Page 11802 [of the preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the proposed standard], Alabama and Georgia are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that are among the leaders in logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. Due to the high heat and humidity of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states, the requirement to wear ballistic nylon chaps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could possibly increase injuries as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatigue caused by hot, humid summer weather (Tr. W2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
206&hyph;07).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Clause (e)(1)(ii) should allow exceptions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearing of leg protectors for all circumstances (not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just climbers) in which there is a greater hazard than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working without them (for instance, fatigue from heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and humidity or loss of mobility in heavy undergrowth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc.). It would be even more appropriate if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearing of ``leg protectors'' were made optional, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the individual work circumstances. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study, (The Role of Personal Protection in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prevention of Accidental Injuries in Logging Work, T. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Klen and S. Vayrynen, Journal of Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accidents, 1984) concluded that personal protectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been very effective and that this was a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a phenomena known as ``risk compensation'', the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendency of workers to be more careless when they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that personal protectors will prevent injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;59). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has carefully reviewed the record on this issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain the requirement that leg protection cover the upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thigh to the boot top. The record clearly shows that chain-saw operators face a significant risk of injury due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback. The WIR survey indicates that 64 percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw injuries reported were the result of kickback (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;1). Further, the WIR survey shows that almost 30 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all injured employees were not wearing leg protection at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time. Also, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were to the leg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Maine BLS survey, chain-saw accidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for 26 percent of all reported injuries and more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than half of those accidents involved chain-saw kickback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not believe the record supports the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters' claims that chain-saw injuries only occur to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area around the knee. Injuries to the lower leg as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee are significant. The WIR survey indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nine percent of all employees reporting injuries were hurt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the lower leg or ankle, while 11 percent were injured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The available accident and injury data also do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the commenters' argument that lack of mobility is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater hazard to chain-saw operators than lack of leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. To the contrary, the data clearly show that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of chain-saw kickback is far more serious than any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential dangers that have been suggested with regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to leg protection (Ex. 2&hyph;1). For example, according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WIR survey, none of the chain-saw operators said they had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been injured because they did not have enough time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retreat from the falling tree. On the other hand, almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds of the chain-saw operators were injured because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chain saw kicked back. In any event, OSHA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions in the proposed and final rule will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately address concerns about mobility. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirement to plan and clear retreat paths before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commencing cutting will protect employees who would be at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk from decreased mobility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OSHA believes the new innovations in leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection technology address the commenters' concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs, mobility, fatigue and heat stress. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record shows that full-leg protection now being manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is light-weight and relatively cool (Ex. 5&hyph;68, 9&hyph;4). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record also shows that light-weight leg protection that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inserted or sewn into logging pants is now available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to one commenter, these new innovations make leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection tolerable even in the hot and humid southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging regions. OSHA believes these innovations will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce fatigue and heat stress and will prevent mobility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from being impeded. Second, the record shows that foot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverings are available that can supplement protection in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those instances where leg protection may not fully cover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logger's lower leg. These devices will provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection in those isolated instances where leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be long enough without requiring the employer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase leg protection in many different sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. First aid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The hearing notice raised two issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about first aid: the number of employees who must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-aid training, and the elements required as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that training, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

 The proposed standard

specified that all supervisors and all fellers be adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained in first aid methods as prescribed by the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health Administration or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent training program. In addition, the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a provision that at least one person in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA received many comments regarding the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who should be trained in first aid in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide adequate protection. There was no consensus among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those commenters on the appropriate number of employees who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be trained. Their recommendations about the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who should be required to receive first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training covered a wide range of options, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. All employees (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;20; Tr. W1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
175, W2 209, OR 100, 375, 393, 681); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All supervisors and fellers (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. All supervisors and enough additional personnel so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each work site would have a trained employee (Tr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 21); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. All supervisors and fellers, plus two additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees on a logging job (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 647); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. All supervisors, fellers, and one-fifth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining crew members (Ex. 9&hyph;19, Tr. OR 282); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All supervisors, fellers and one-fourth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining crew members (Tr. OR 206); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. All supervisors and some fellers (Ex. 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;53, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters who recommended first aid training for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited number of employees, said that training all fellers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or all other employees was excessive since the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would also require employees to work within visual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audible contact of another employee (Ex. 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter said that requiring all fellers to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained would be duplicative since more than one feller may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work at a work site (Ex. 5&hyph;63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said they already provide first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training for each employee:

Everyone_all the people on our crew are trained [in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid] on a rotating basis. Now, the fellow that's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been with us six months, he has not been to the first-aid class yet. Also, one of the_I believe it's in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Nortim Corporation, the Nortim self insured, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is one of the regulations that we do have people on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the job that are versed in first aid (Tr. OR 174). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another hearing participant stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with overall safety training, I feel that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required first aid training for all employees is simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common sense (Tr. OR 393).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Other commenters indicated that they are providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid training to a substantial portion of employees, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part because the company's logging operations are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Mr. Lesser: Does your training program include first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid training? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Bell: We provide first aid training to just about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whoever wants it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Lesser: Who do you require to have first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Bell: We require all supervisors, leadmen, hook

tenders, leaders of crews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Lesser: Using the voluntary nature offering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid, do you get a lot of volunteers? What 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the work force is trained in first aid? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Bell: I'd say 35 percent (Tr. OR 375).

As discussed above, there is no dispute that logging is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a hazardous industry. All data sources in the record show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a significant number of accidents occur in the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry and that the severity of injuries sustained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers is greater than that suffered by employees in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries. Loggers often work in isolated locations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are far from hospitals or health care providers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes are accessible only by helicopters or vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to operate on the most rugged terrain (Ex. 9&hyph;20; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tr. OR 21). Accordingly, loggers need to be trained and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped to handle the significant number of severe injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that might arise. In many instances these trained employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be the only persons available to render assistance at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical time.

OSHA believes that first aid training for only a select 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
few individuals, such as supervisors and fellers, is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to ensure that injured loggers receive first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is timely and appropriate. First, when only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected employees are trained, they may not be close enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the site of the accident to render assistance in time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WIR survey indicates that more than one-half of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries reported occurred at cutting sites, that in most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases are remote from landings and from medical facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;1). The WIR survey is consistent with the OSHA FCI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study, that indicated that more than 70 percent of logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees killed were working at cutting sites (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One hearing participant reinforced this problem: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The rigging crew is often 1,000 feet and sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 feet from the landing. The work site is usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on rough, steep ground, and these workers often use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous cutting implements such as axes and chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saws. If the first aid trained person and the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid kit are in the yarder, that can be 15 minutes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more from where the worst exposure is (Tr. OR 21). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, since the final rule allows employees to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain contact with another employee by visual or audible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact, an employee may be miles from the contact person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when radio communication is used. In such cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact person may not be able to provide immediate first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, limiting first aid training to all supervisors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and some additional personnel may not be adequate when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisors are not at the work site when an accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs. According to the State of Washington, logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisors usually have two or more logging crews working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly for them (Ex. 5&hyph;34). These logging crews are often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersed over five square miles or more. In addition, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger operations, foremen usually see each crew only once a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day and rarely for more than one hour of the workshift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenters said in his experience it was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncommon to find a group of employees working in a location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without a supervisor and no other employee in the group has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a current first aid certificate (Ex. 91&hyph;5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a logger's injuries may be of such severity that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several persons trained in first aid may be needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stabilize the injured employee and treat the injury. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only one employee is trained, the first aid assistance may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, when only one employee in a work site is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained, as the proposed rule contemplates, first aid will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obviously be inadequate if the trained person is the one who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is injured. (Although first-aid training does include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruction in self-aid, the injuries may be severe enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to incapacitate the trained employee.) For example, in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small working crew that has no supervisor, the feller may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the only employee who is trained in first-aid. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feller is injured, there may be no other logger in that work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crew who is trained to provide first aid. The WIR survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that one-half of all loggers who were injured were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing felling tasks (i.e., felling, limbing, bucking) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, when only a few employees receive first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, there is a greater likelihood that there could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crucial gaps in coverage due to sickness, vacations, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave, or employee turnover of those few who have received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. In addition, an employer may not know from day to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day if an employee will be present that is holding a current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid certificate (Ex. 5&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA notes that some commenters opposed requiring every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee to have first-aid training because of the transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the logging industry. OSHA finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters' argument does not support the position that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer employees should be trained. If there is high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee turnover, it may be the trained employee who is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed any longer. If work continues without a fully-trained person while a first-aid replacement is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained, employees may be at great risk. By contrast, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work has to be stopped until a replacement can be trained, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer could incur costs which could be prevented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having adequate first aid coverage in advance. If all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees working in the logging industry are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have first-aid training, a pool of trained employees will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always be available to employers for hiring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, requiring that each employee be trained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates confusion and may be less administratively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome than making a daily check and rescheduling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work assignments to assure that supervisors, fellers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some additional number of employees in each operating area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold current first aid training certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ease the training burden for employers, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule does not require that the first-aid training be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the employer. Rather, the final rule requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the employer assure that each employee performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations receives or has received first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training and that the first-aid training/certificate is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current. For example, as one means of complying with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, the employer could make first-aid training a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of hiring or continued employment. The employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be free to hire only those persons who had previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained first-aid training and kept their certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current. In addition, when there is employee turnover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained employees will be able to bring their first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skills from one workplace to another and thus relieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training burden for the new employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware that some employers currently provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-aid training and most likely will continue to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such training. OSHA is also aware that a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations and schools provide first-aid training that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would meet the requirements of Appendix B. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration, State extension services, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colleges, and adult education programs all provide first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training that includes CPR. As such, OSHA does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirement of assuring that all employees have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received first-aid training that remains current will pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an unreasonable burden on any employer or employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

b. Elements of first-aid training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, OSHA requested comment on the specific elements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as CPR, that should be included in first-aid training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule OSHA did not specify the basic elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which supervisors and fellers must be trained. Rather, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposed that first-aid training meet the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of courses provided by the American Red Cross, MSHA or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent training program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters recommended that OSHA require CPR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training as part of required first-aid training (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;50, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;19). Both NIOSH and the U.S. Dept. of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interior supported the CPR training requirement. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers, especially those deep in the woods are not close to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical facilities during the ``golden hour'' where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resuscitation may save a person's life, OSHA agrees with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters that it is essential that all loggers be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform CPR. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a requirement for annual CPR training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, OSHA has specified other basic skills and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge in Appendix B (mandatory) that are important for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing aid to injured loggers in isolated settings. OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is aware that there are many well-recognized first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs that have broad-based curricula which already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy OSHA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5. Visual and audible contact.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the hearing notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requested comment on the maximum time and/or distance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separation between employees. In the proposed rule, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a requirement that employees work within visual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audible contact of another employee, so that someone would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be able to respond quickly in case of an accident or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency. The proposed rule prohibited the use of engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noise, such as from chain saws, as a means of contact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various State logging standards also prohibit the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw noise as a means of signaling (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on the contact and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signaling provisions. Many commenters testified that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed contact requirement is necessary (Ex. 5&hyph;14, 5&hyph;17, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;13; Tr. W2 197&hyph;98). One commenter
said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We think that visual or audible contact is important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will save lives. There are also electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices, some sophisticated and some like citizen band 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radios, that can be used by forest workers to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audible contact by electronic means. We recommend that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing proposed language be retained but modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps to allow audible contact by electronic means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. W2 197&hyph;98).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain commenters urged OSHA to make the contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement stricter than that proposed. One commenter said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in solitary jobs also need to remain in contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, therefore, should be provided with two-way radios (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;15). Another commenter said OSHA should require employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remain within visual contact of another crew members (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;20). Finally, two commenters recommended that OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require employees to work within normal hearing or calling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance of another employee (Ex. 9&hyph;19; Tr. OR 679&hyph;81). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, several commenters expressed various concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the contact provision, and particularly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition against chain-saw noise as a means of contact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, some participants said the requirements would have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse impact on small employers, especially employers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work crews consisting of three or fewer loggers (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;70). For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter said:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This requirement may adversely affect the livelihood of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many small-scale loggers in the South who may work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone in the woods, or operate a single mobile ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skidder or felling machine and are frequently out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact with other phases of the logging operation (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;28). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This requirement would not be practical for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) there are a number of logging contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that work alone, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) log crews with two or three members are often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of contact because the great distance between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faller and log header, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) even at close range, visual and audible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signals are attenuated by thick brush and loud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
My experience has been loggers will keep track of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fellow workers the best they can but, due to the nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the job, individuals will be separated for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lengths of time. To require loggers to be within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signaling distance of one another will preclude the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of one and two man log crews, working in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thick brush, working in hilly topography, skidding long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distances, the use of ear plugs or working with loud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines (Ex. 5&hyph;70).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, some commenters believed the contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement conflicted with the proposed requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain a distance of two tree lengths between work areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70). These commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a separation of two tree lengths between work areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might make it impossible to maintain contact due to saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noise and obstructions such as hills or vegetation. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter explained:

If this code goes through and is enacted, it would change the timber falling industry in Alaska. Southeast Alaska is
a relatively new geological area. We work on steep ground that is broken up by draws, gullies, cliffs. We have our timber
fallers work together as partners. One works in one strip or one area of the hillside and the other one works in another
area of the hillside. For safety reasons, our company requires that they work at least three tree lengths apart. And
often with the broken up terrain, that precludes visual contact (Tr. OR 353).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, comments were received on the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device. Some participants supported
the prohibition (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42). Other commenters argued that chain-saw noise is currently
being used as a means of contact in the logging industry and should be allowed in the final rule (Tr. W1 65; OR 86, 353&hyph;55,
356&hyph;58, 384&hyph;85, 694&hyph;96). For example, one commenter said the sound of chain saws is an indicator
that someone is working at a specific location (Tr. W1 65). Another commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e have been counting on chain saw noise for years. Chain saw noise is possible, and by the way, that's my most dangerous
part of my job is to do a safety inspection or to go up and check on cutters in a strip, to approach cutters. And I listen
to the saw. And I can tell when they are putting a cut into a standing tree or bucking a log with the chain saw noise. If we
are not allowed to use chain saw noise as audible contact, that means we may have to go back to double jacking which is
a faller and a bucker working in tandem (Tr. OR 353&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This participant also said that chain-saw noise should also be permitted because 103-decibel chain-saw engines
render 92-decibel personal alarm systems inadequate as means of audible contact (Tr. OR 355). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, several commenters urged OSHA to adopt various alternatives and modifications to the proposed contact requirement
(Ex. 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55; Tr. OR 670&hyph;81). For example, commenters suggested that OSHA replace the contact
provision with a ``check-in'' requirement: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In West Virginia, a cutting crew often consists of a worker who fells and limbs the trees and a worker who operates a skidder.
Consequently, it is often necessary that the feller be left alone in the woods, without audible or visual contact with
another worker, for short periods of time while the skidder operator is making the trip to the log landing. Also, it
is common practice for workers to be constantly checking on one another. Upon his return from the landing, the skidder
operator immediately checks on the feller; and, the feller, if the skidder operator does not return in the normal time
span, will check on the skidder operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the common small cutting crew size, the practice of constantly checking on one another, and the difficulties
involved in using an audible signal capable of being heard over distances, over machine noise, and through hearing
protection devices, it is our recommendation that this aspect of the Standard be changed to allow a worker to be out
of ``visual or audible signal contact with another person'' for short periods of time. Due to the normal time involved
for transporting a skidder load to the landing, unhooking, and returning, we recommend that this short time period
be established at 20 minutes (Ex. 5&hyph;54).

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters also suggested that OSHA allow employees to be out of contact from other employees for short periods
of time (e.g., 15 to 20 minutes, the time to take a load to the landing and return) (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 670&hyph;81).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has decided in the final rule to retain the requirement that employees work within visual or audible contact of
another employee. As discussed above, most commenters indicated that remaining in contact is important to the safety
of loggers. Several commenters said that supervisors use chain-saw noise to identify where and whether an employee
is working. However, they did not provide evidence that chain-saw noise provides an effective means of communicating
information from the employee or from the supervisor. For example, data and information available to OSHA indicates
that even though chain-saw noise is currently used as a means of maintaining contact, there are still reports from
OSHA case file investigations of loggers being injured and not being discovered until after the shift has ended (Ex.
1). In addition, chain-saw noise does not provide the cutter with an adequate means of communicating with others in
the event they have become injured or are in other trouble. Since all chain-saw noise indicates is whether an employee
is working, the cutter must wait until another employee recognizes that the lack of noise means the cutter needs assistance.
This may delay rendering that assistance. OSHA believes the cutter, not just the supervisor, needs to have a method
for communicating when necessary. Radios and telephones are modern communication methods that are increasingly
used in this logging industry. These methods, unlike chain-saw noise, provide immediate two-way communication.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although OSHA has decided to retain in the final rule the prohibition against use of chain-saw noise alone as a means
of contact, the final rule does provide employers with a great deal of flexibility in maintaining contact with employees.
First, permitting radio communication to be used as a means of contact allows contact to be maintained while at the
same time maintaining a two tree-length distance between adjacent occupied work areas. Second, permitting contact
to be maintained by radio or whistles allows employees to work alone rather than limiting employees to working in teams
that are within visual distance of each other. Allowing radio contact will also provide flexibility for small radio
crew operations when visual or voice contact may not be possible. Third, OSHA also believes that permitting radio
contact will not be unduly burdensome for the industry since many companies already are utilizing electronic communications
(Ex. 5&hyph;27; Tr. W2 227). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the issue of equipment noise preventing radio communication, OSHA notes that radios are available
with ear phones that fit inside hearing protection muffs. Where such ear phones and hearing protectors are provided,
equipment noise will neither interfere with communication nor should result in occupational hearing loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because contact may be maintained by radio, OSHA has removed the exception to the contact requirement for ``single
employee assignments.'' OSHA believes that radio communication already is necessary in order for many of those single
employee jobs to be performed (e.g., watchman). As such, OSHA does not believe that extending the radio contact requirement
to all logging operations will unduly burden employers, while at the same time it will provide important protection
for all loggers.

6. Chain-saw protective devices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed standard, OSHA did not include a provision requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes or
other devices that prevent kickback. The proposed standard also did not require chain saws to meet any performance
criteria of any standards-setting organizations. Rather, OSHA proposed only to require employers to inspect and
maintain chain-saw safety devices when chain saws were so equipped. The hearing notice requested further comment
on the adequacy of various chain-saw safety devices and what regulatory action OSHA should take in the final standard
regarding chain saws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was no dispute among commenters that chain-saw protective devices are necessary to prevent operators from
being injured. The record shows that the chain-saw bar can kick back in less than 0.3 seconds (Ex. 4&hyph;172). The
record also shows that average human reaction time, however, is only 0.75 seconds (Ex. 4&hyph;172). That means in
many cases the operator cannot take action quickly enough to avoid being struck by the chain saw. The record also shows
that many injuries in the logging industry are the result of chain-saw kickback. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent
of all logging injuries reported involved chain saws and almost two-thirds of those injuries were the result of chain-saw
kickback (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The Maine BLS survey also shows that chain-saw injuries account for a significant number
of logging injuries (26%) in that State (Ex. 4&hyph;175). Similar to the WIR survey, the Maine BLS survey indicated
that over half of all chain-saw accidents resulted from kickback.

a. Devices to prevent chain-saw kickback. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information submitted to the docket indicates that there are four devices that exist to reduce or minimize the risk
of injury due to chain-saw kickback. These devices are chain brakes, bar tip guards, reduced-kickback guide bars,
and low- or reduced-kickback saw chains. Information about these devices was taken from a 1983 report prepared for
the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) (Ex. 5&hyph;13) as well as comments to the proposed rule. The discussion
that follows explains the different devices and their advantages and disadvantages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
chain brake
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a device for stopping the saw chain when kickback occurs before the chain can contact the operator. The most common
type of chain brake is actuated when the operator's hand or arm hits the brake lever that is located immediately ahead
of the front handle. When kickback occurs, the chain brake may either be actuated by the operator's hand pivoting forward
on the handle, or by the hand being dislodged from the handle, striking the brake lever. According to the CPSC report,
chain brakes, unlike new technology chains and safety guide bars, do not have any adverse effect on the cutting effectiveness
of chain saws. The record also indicates that one of the advantages of chain brakes is that, unlike other protective
devices that can be removed, the chain brake is an integral part of the saw and is difficult to remove (Ex. 4&hyph;174).
As such, chain brakes deter the disabling of the kickback prevention system by the operator (Ex. 5&hyph;19).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bar tip guard 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(or nose tip guard) is a device that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is bolted or screwed onto the tip of the bar. Its primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function is to prevent contact with the tip of the bar from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which kickback is generated. Commenters identified three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems with bar tip guards. First, one commenter said bar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tip guards are not usable in felling and bucking of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees (Ex. 9&hyph;16). This commenter said forward leaning trees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually require the bar tip to fell the tree safely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, two commenters said the hazards associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bar tip guards outweigh their protective value (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;20). According to NIOSH bar tip guards reduce
kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger only under certain conditions, that is, when the log 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or limb is elevated and does not have any off-angle to cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pinching of the bar (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bar tip guard may pose greater hazards than saws without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tips because they require the bucker to maintain working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stances that are less stable. The other commenter said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bar tip can get caught on limbs. Third, the major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem with bar tip guards is that they are removable (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;13H). According to the CPSC report, the bar tip 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guard is removed by operators because it reduces the utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the saw by preventing boring and the cutting of any logs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are wider than the guide bar. Evidence in the record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that bar tip guards are being removed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant number of operators: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Only about half of the operators of saws so equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always use such guards. About 36 percent never use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them, and about 12 percent sometimes take them off the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guide bar. Thus, while nose tip guards are effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anti-kickback devices, many operators remove them from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their saws (Ex. 5&hyph;13). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(PPEMA) submitted testimony from CPSC's own proceedings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which also acknowledged the extent to which bar tip guards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are removed from chain saws:

[T]he Commission received the benefit of a survey that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was done on the part of the NESDA, National Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Servicing Dealers Association. They on their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed hundreds of their dealers. *&blank;*&blank;* [T]heir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey corroborated my own personal observations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
namely, that in real life practice users of chain saws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the droves are simply not using that nose tip, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while if it were used or if it were permanently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established on the saw, it would be a complete barrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to kickback, the fact of the matter is because it's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary and because it is removed, because in my view 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it affects in the case of the dealers, as you'll see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from their comments, it affects the efficacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw, it is taken off, and as a result provides no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection, zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Just to cite from the survey, 73.5 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding dealers to the NESDA survey reported that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only zero to five percent of the chain saws brought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into their shops for repair, of the ones that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally equipped with the nose guards, that 73.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the dealers responded that only zero to five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent had nose guards in place. Another 9.3 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported that six to ten percent of such saws had nose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guards in place, leaving only 17.1 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dealers who put the figure of nose guards in place at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
something more than ten percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unmistakable conclusion is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overwhelming majority of consumers are removing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nose guards from their saws and not putting them on in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The survey also revealed that almost no consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are interested in replacing nose guards that are not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. Eighty-eight percent of the dealers, 88 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, stated that zero percent of their customers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted replacements, and an additional 8.9 percent put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the replacement request at a mere one to five percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;13H). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two different types of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reduced-kickback guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bars.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One is designed and manufactured with a taper from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the back of the bar and has a correspondingly small radius 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of curvature at the tip of the bar. This type of bar is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly referred to as a narrow nose bar. The other type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reduced kickback guide bar has a reduced radius nose but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieves its taper from the fact that the top and bottom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edges of the bar a asymmetrical (the top and bottom edges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are curved and have a different radius of curvature). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type bar is commonly called a banana bar because of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peculiar shape. According to the CPSC report, both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow nose bar and the banana bar have significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drawbacks, primarily in the useful life of the bar and chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the efficiency of the chain saw. The narrow nose bar, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of its reduced radius of curvature at the tip, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives more stress at the tip, thereby requiring more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent replacement. Because of its asymmetrical design, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the banana bar cannot be merely turned over when the bottom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edge of the bar becomes worn, but must be replaced. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of bar also reduces the ability of the operator to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the saw for boring. This disadvantage is compounded if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw also is equipped with a low- or reduced-kickback chain.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he use of low-kickback guide bars results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tradeoff of some reduction in utility for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement in safety. Industry sources have suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this may be an acceptable tradeoff for the less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powerful saws which are probably purchased by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers. Since the tradeoff involves a marginal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement in safety, however, manufacturers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably less willing to equip the more powerful, more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance oriented saws with the low-kickback guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bars (Ex. 5&hyph;13). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the potential for kickback can be reduced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
low- or reduced-kickback chain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This chain is commonly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as new generation chain. Low kickback chain can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identified by an idler or spacer link between each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutting links. In other words, the chain has a left hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutter link on the right side of the chain, followed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spacer link, followed by a right hand cutter link on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left side of the chain followed by another spacer link 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the sequence begins again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the low-kickback chain can reduce kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy by 40 to 90 percent, there are drawbacks to its use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the CPSC report. These drawbacks include: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New technology chains generally exhibit some loss in cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency (speed and ease of cutting), (2) these chains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make cutting more tiring for the operator thereby causing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more operator fatigue, and (3) the loss of cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency may adversely affect the life of the chain. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of cutting efficiency has been estimated to be anywhere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a 10 to 25 percent. OSHA has no estimates of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in operator fatigue and the degradation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service life of the chain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the four protective devices, most commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA should require chain saws to be equipped with a chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake because it is the most used and most effective for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional logging operations (Ex. 4&hyph;175, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42,
5&hyph;46, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;18, 9&hyph;20; Tr. OR 536&hyph;37). Several of these
commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all chain saws used at their establishments are equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with chain brakes. These commenters also said that almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all manufacturers now produce chain saws with some kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brake and that almost all chain saws manufactured for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial logging operations now have chain brakes (Ex. 5&hyph;19; Tr. OR 185&hyph;87, 536). In addition, one commenter
said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that manufacturers have improved earlier mechanical problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with chain brakes so that they are reliable in preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback (Ex. 9&hyph;4). With regard to the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brakes, one commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The chain brake is, I'd say, one of the most important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saw protective devices developed in modern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history. In Montana all of our current professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saws are equipped with chain brakes. Most of our saws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are in the four to six cubic inch range, primarily, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stihl and Husqvarna with a few other minor brands and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seldom on job visitations do I find anyone who has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disconnected the chain brake. It's so uncommon that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it's startling when I find that any more.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The other protective device that I see that's had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial improvement is the throttle lock mechanism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where it has to be held down with your palm in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the trigger to operate. For years it was common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the first thing a logger did was he got a roll of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
black tape and he would tape that down so you didn't 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to operate that. Through our progressive Montana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sawyer Safety Program and other efforts I brag to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people that we now have developed a genetically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superior timber faller in Montana that can now squeeze 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with his palm and pull with his trigger finger at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These two chain saw protective devices combined with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection have had a significant impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of accidents in Montana relative to timber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falling. In fact, it's been so significant that I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
don't even consider the other options of even any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to logging when we talk about the low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback bar, the low kick-back chains and even the bar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tipped guards. They may have individual special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application but I'm thoroughly convinced with the chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake, the throttle lock and the leg protection we've 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so significantly reduced chain saw injuries that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further attention is maybe some wasted effort and just 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further develops additional conflict (Tr. OR 536).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. David Kludt, Logging Safety Program Supervisor for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State of Idaho, testified that 10 percent of all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents each month are the result of chain-saw kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that these accidents could be drastically reduced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of chain brakes (Ex. 9&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Maine BLS says that chain brakes have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
played a significant role in lessening the effects of chain-saw injuries in that State (Ex. 5&hyph;174). They reported
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain brakes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were present resulted in hospitalization, while nearly half 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all other accidents required hospitalization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters, however, disputed the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brakes for preventing kickback (Ex. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;59, 5&hyph;66). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of these commenters said chain brakes were not reliable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and required frequent maintenance, however, no evidence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data were presented to support the contention (ex. 5&hyph;59). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter said that a study showed that while chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes reduced kickback by 80 percent, non-kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents showed a 400 percent increase (Ex. 5&hyph;66). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the commenter also admitted that the study was from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1972 and that chain brakes had undergone significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement since that time. Another commenter said chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes, depending on their design, could become entangled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the brush the saw is clearing and create a safety hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;39). The WIR survey, however, does not support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter's argument. None of the chain-saw operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting injuries said their chain brake had become caught 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule should include requirements for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective devices (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;46, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;18, 9&hyph;20; Tr. OR 536&hyph;37). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some commenters, including chain-saw and chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessory manufacturers, said OSHA should include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance requirements for chain saws in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard rather than specification requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;8, 5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;15, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;37,
5&hyph;59). Many of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported incorporating by reference the American National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards Institute (ANSI) B175.1&hyph;1985 standard on ``Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for Gasoline Powered Chain Saws'' (Ex. 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;8, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;15, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;37, 5&hyph;59). The ANSI standard specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a performance criteria for manufacture and testing of chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw safety features, such as protection from chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback. One commenter summed up their rationale:

[T]he Status Report on Chain Saw Related Hazards since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1985 Revision to The Voluntary Standard ANSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B175.1, which was prepared for the Consumer Product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety Commission in March of this year, is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimonial to the fact that the reduction in chain saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries is the result of adherence by manufacturers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the voluntary standard. There truly is little to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said in defense of OSHA when it chooses to knowingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignore the demonstrated success of the chain saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary standard, which equates compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a combination of devices, in favor of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arbitrary and inexpert agency decision to the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that one specific device, in and of itself, is superior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any other device or combination of devices permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the standard (Ex. 5&hyph;4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These commenters stated that OSHA would create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``confusion in the marketplace'' if OSHA adopted requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were significantly different from the ANSI chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard that all manufacturers have been voluntarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following (Ex. 5&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters, however, opposed incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI standard in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;48; Tr. OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
118). These commenters said the ANSI standard was developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect consumer chain-saw users, not professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The ANSI B175.1 Standard was developed from an injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data base that was consumer based and therefore its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct application to pro-logging may not be justified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;27).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters said that ANSI standards were not known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to most loggers, were not readily available, and were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written in language that the average logger would comprehend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;27; Tr. OR 118). One of these commenters said OSHA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, should put its requirements in the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than requiring logging employers to obtain and read 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another document (Tr. OR 118). He added that placing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the regulatory text would increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, many commenters supported a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that all chain saws be equipped with chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes rather than just referencing the ANSI standard. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, these commenters said chain brakes were the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective device to protect operators from kickback and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide extra protection when the saws are carried between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutting jobs. In addition, one commenter supported a chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake requirement for the following reason:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. should follow the lead of other countries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(European) and require that all saws have an operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brake if purchased after the adoption of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The cost would be minimal since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of saws now come equipped with these devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would also help deter the disabling of the brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system by operating personnel (Ex. 5&hyph;19).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees with commenters that the final standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include requirements on chain-saw protective devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule does incorporate by reference the ANSI B175.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus standard, but the Agency believes that the ANSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard alone does not provide the necessary degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety for logging employees. Accordingly, for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons, the final rule also requires that chain saws placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into initial service after the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard be equipped with chain brakes. First, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable evidence in the record that chain brakes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective and the most used device to prevent kickback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, they have strong acceptance by logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals, and as a result, already are standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment on almost all chain saws currently manufactured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, chain brakes do not have the disadvantages of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other protective devices. For example, unlike bar tip 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guards, chain brakes are not removed by operators. Unlike 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced-kickback guide bars and low- or reduced-kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chains, chain brakes do not affect production efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, other countries also have adopted provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, OSHA agrees with commenters who are concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, in order to maximize compliance, the standard be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensible to the average loggers. This is especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important for chain-saw safety, since many employees provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own chain saws. These employees and their employers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need plain and simple direction about what protection must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided for each chain-saw operator. OSHA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that the ANSI standard contains the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information needed by those operating the chain saw. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the use of sophisticated equipment and exacting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that are beyond the expertise of the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging employer. Much of the ANSI standard deals with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer program for simulating chain-saw kickbacks and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests to determine the accuracy of the computer program. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such, the ANSI standard is primarily directed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of chain saws, rather than employers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in the logging industry. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this standard is to establish minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety requirements with respect to the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portable, hand-held, gasoline-powered chain saws (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4&hyph;66).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of the ANSI standard are primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the unique purview of manufacturers, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the throttle control system, handles, pull-type starters, fuel tanks and oil tanks, exhaust systems,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound levels, and vibration. Only the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are directed at the employer:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chain saw in accordance with the instructions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner's manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chain saws shall be used in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating instructions and safety precautions listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner's manual. It shall be the responsibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner to see that such instructions and precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are given to every operator who uses the saw (Ex. 4&hyph;66).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the ANSI standard does not require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer to ensure that each chain saw used in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace is equipped with kickback protection. That is, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI standard does not require the employer to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback prevention devices are not removed or disabled by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators. By specifying that chain saws used by logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees be equipped with chain brakes, OSHA emphasizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that responsibility for compliance with OSHA standards rests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the employer, not the manufacturer or the employee.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to retain flexibility in the final rule, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is requiring chain saws placed in service after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this standard to be equipped with chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes or other protective device that prevents or minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback. OSHA notes that whatever kickback device is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present, the final rule requires that it not be removed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
7. Operator manuals or instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice OSHA raised two issues regarding operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manuals or instructions (referred to collectively as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions) for machines: the location of instructions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the experience of employers in obtaining manuals from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Location of operator manuals or instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing pulpwood standard and the proposed standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained provisions requiring either an operator's manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or set of instructions be kept with each machine. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, both stated that the instructions, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must describe the operation, maintenance and safe practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the machine. The proposed standard added a provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring each operator and maintenance employee to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters generally agreed with the need to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions available to operators and maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel. Several hearing participants supported OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to require instructions to be kept with machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. W1 201, OR 168, 194). For example, one participant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA to require that operator manuals be kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the machine. Operator manuals contain important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal safety and machine operational information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which must be utilized during training and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for reference to assure safety for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different operating conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficient and productive logging operations go hand in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand with safe work practices and proper machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance and operation. Ready and immediate access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to safety and operational information is essential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize downtime caused by accidents (Tr. OR 168). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter added that once instructions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed back at the office, they are not used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ms. Schuster: I just have one question. Do you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have any idea of the percentage of equipment out there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the woods that does not currently have operator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manuals available? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Carr: I'm afraid I'd have to agree, most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them probably do not. This is our concern as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers that most of them do not. Most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time they have taken them and put them in the office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that's the last they see of them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Schuster: You say most of them would have put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them in the office. Would you say that many of them do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have them available though somewhere, if not on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Carr: If somebody can find it (Tr. OR 194).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters, however, stated that for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons instructions should not be kept with machines or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead should be distributed as part of the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;67, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;19,
9&hyph;22; Tr. W1 66, 134, 185, 235, W2 225, OR 31, 59, 263, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
378, 629). First, these commenters said instructions kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with machines would be damaged or destroyed. They stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that instructions would be subject to vandalism or would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disappear if kept with machines or vehicles. They also said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions would become dirty or be destroyed due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse weather in which machines and vehicles are operated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, these commenters stated that they store 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator instructions at the company office, in the crew 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport vehicles or at the work site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, several commenters said that it was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to keep instructions with machines because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have limited utility (Ex. 9&hyph;4; Tr. W1 134, 186, OR 80, 117, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
378, 430, 629). Some of these commenters said instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertain primarily to maintenance of machines and scheduling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of maintenance and, therefore, should be kept where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance will be conducted. Other commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions contain such general information about machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation that their only utility is for someone who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfamiliar with the operation of the machine. Instead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these and other participants said the manuals should be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in operator training sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, some participants said that instructions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently given to new employees to read as part of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation sessions (Tr. W1 66; OR 31, 263, 629). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants also said that if operators need to refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely to instructions at the work site, they should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be allowed to operate the machine and should receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional training rather than being allowed to rely on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments and testimony received, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has decided in the final rule to require that operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintenance instructions be available on the machine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the area where the machine is being operated, such as at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the landing or in a crew transport vehicle located in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area where the machine is being operated. OSHA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready access to instructions is important for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons. As OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, instructions are necessary not only for maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel but also for operators who are unsure or unaware 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safe operating procedures pose hazards to themselves and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
co-workers. Maintaining these materials in the immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work area of the machine assures their availability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the likelihood of their use when needed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also believes that instructions have utility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators in specific circumstances. Instructions give the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator a ready reference source when a new or unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation is encountered (e.g., operations on terrain where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a combination of hazards are present, such as swampy, rocky 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or loose ground). If unusual problems or emergencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring prompt correction arise during operation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions provide the operator with correct information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to resolve the problem rather than guessing about a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution. In addition, some machine operators perform their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own maintenance. By keeping instructions on the machine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the immediate work area, these operators can quickly deal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with maintenance issues as they arise. Therefore, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that instructions are useful for the operator only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when they can be immediately accessed rather than being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housed at an office that may be miles from the work area or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also agrees with commenters who said that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions are not kept in the work area of the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will not be used. OSHA is concerned that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions are not in the area where the machine is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated, operators will be discouraged from stopping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production to go get the instructions. Instead, employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will decide to ``take their chances'' in dealing with unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems or emergencies, which could result in serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the issue of weather damage to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions which are kept on the machine or in the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work area, OSHA notes that a hearing participant pointed out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that in recent years, manufacturers have been providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather-resistant instructions which may be kept with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines (Tr. OR 205). Moreover, it should not be overly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult for an employer to place the instructions in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather-proof bag to keep them with the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does agree with commenters' position that if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator must 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
routinely
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refer to instructions in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate a machine or vehicle, additional training or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision is necessary. The final rule does provide such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional training for that operator. However, there may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well be instances in which the employee may need to consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manual in order to deal with a problem that arises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the use of the equipment. For that reason, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions should be immediately available to employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, OSHA is requiring in this final rule that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions be maintained in the immediate work area of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine so they will be available both to the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator and to maintenance personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Obtaining operator manuals or instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice OSHA also requested employers to discuss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their experience with trying to obtain operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions or replacement instructions from dealers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. OSHA wanted to gather information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of machines that come with instructions and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of ease in obtaining replacement instructions. Very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
few participants commented in this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One hearing participant said that manufacturers do provide instructions with new equipment, but used machines that
are sold may have no instructions (Tr. OR 31). However, two hearing participants said that replacement instructions
are available either from the manufacturer or the dealer, and therefore, they have had no more difficulty in obtaining
instructions than in acquiring any machine replacement part (Tr. W1 201, OR 197). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA therefore believes that the requirement that instructions for machine be maintained will not be burdensome
for employers, even where employers must obtain replacement copies from the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
8. Riders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether trainers should be permitted to ride on machines to observe
operator performance. The pulpwood logging standard prohibited riders or observers from riding on machines unless
seating and other protection were provided. The proposed standard continued that prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the current and proposed prohibition of riders on machines (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;22,
5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;18; Tr. W1 202, 205, 235, W2 227, OR 155, 169). These commenters said riders
should be prohibited, unless protection is provided since they are exposed to the same hazards as machine operators,
for whom seating, seat belts and other protection is required. NIOSH, for example, supported the prohibition for
the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Many logging operations occur on rough terrain which would expose any rider to a high risk of injury or death. Serious
errors made by a trainer or trainee under these conditions endangers both people; it must be recognized that logging
equipment is not designed for training purposes (i.e., the trainer cannot take control of the equipment from the trainee
in a safe, orderly fashion) (Ex. 5&hyph;42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIOSH therefore recommended that training be conducted and completed in pre-worksite training where the environment
can be ``controlled'' instead of the employer conducting ``on- the-job'' training with machines that are not designed
to carry passengers safely. Another commenter agreed that the necessary operator training should be given, and the
operator should be afforded the opportunity to practice on level ground, before the operator moves into work areas.
This training and practice would allow operators to become proficient without requiring trainers to ride on the machines
(Tr. OR 155). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters, including one who supported the exemption for trainers, stated that it was not absolutely necessary
to have the trainer riding on the machine in order to maintain communication with the machine operator (Ex. 5&hyph;27;
Tr. W2 227). They said communication could be accomplished through radio contact (one-way or two-way radios), thus
allowing the trainer to remain in a safe location on the ground. One of the commenters pointed out that this method is
currently used in logging operations in Scandinavian countries (Tr. W2 227).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters supported an exception permitting trainers to ride on machines (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;28,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92,
9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;10, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;19; Tr. OR 32, 201, 206, 337). These commenters said that an exemption
be allowed because trainers were not as great since they ride for only short periods and, therefore, they are not exposed
to hazards to the same extent as machine operators. However, several commenters said that if instructors were permitted
to ride on machines that at least seat belts should be required and training should be conducted on level terrain (Ex.
5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. OR 169). Another commenter said that trainers should not be permitted to ride
on machines during actual production because ``such conditions may not be conducive to rider safety'' (Ex. 5&hyph;54).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said the exemption should include other employees in addition to training (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;2;
Tr. OR 206). One commenter supported expanding the exception to allow mechanics to ride on machines (Tr. OR 206). Another
commenter said that the exception should be permitted for large multi-purpose logging equipment where there is sufficient
room in the enclosed operator cab to permit another person to ride safely, even though there is not a second seat (Ex.
5&hyph;27). One commenter said fellers should be permitted to ride back to the landing at the end of the workshift (Ex.
9&hyph;2). However, none of these commenters provided any evidence that these riders were not exposed to the same
hazards as the machine operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has carefully considered all comments and data in the record. OSHA agrees with the commenters that riders face
the same hazards as machine operators on moving equipment and that they need protection equivalent to that of the operator.
According to logging fatalities reported to OSHA between 1985&hyph;90, there were reports of riders killed when
machines roll over (Ex. 4&hyph;65). The OSHA FCI report also indicated that loggers have been killed riding on unauthorized
parts of machines (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Even those who opposed the prohibition on riders recognized that such an activity
is hazardous due to conditions of the work environment, such as unlevel terrain. In addition, the record indicates
that an exemption for trainers is unnecessary because other methods of communication between the trainee and trainer
are available and in use in the logging industry. As such, OSHA has retained the requirement in the final standard that
machines must have passenger protection equivalent to operator protection if the employer allows riders on machines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
9. Equipment protective devices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA raised two issues regarding protective devices for machines: the need and cost of retrofitting
machines with rollover protective structures (ROPS) and falling object protective structures (FOPS), and the appropriateness
of incorporating various consensus standards covering ROPS and FOPS into the logging standard by reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Retrofitting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether the final standard should require machines without ROPS and
FOPS to be retrofitted with those devices. The proposed standard would not have required retrofitting. In the proposed
standard, OSHA specified that certain machines placed in service after the effective date of the final standard to
be equipped with ROPS and/or FOPS meeting Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) minimum performance criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was no opposition from commenters on the general requirement that certain machines used in logging operations
be equipped with ROPS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
and/or FOPS. NIOSH stated that 80 deaths occurred due to logging machine rollovers from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex. 5&hyph;42).
This is approximately 13 deaths each year due to rollover accidents. Another commenter cited a study where 12 loggers
were killed in rollover accidents in the State of Washington from 1977&hyph;83 (Tr. W1 27). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters said that machines without ROPS and FOPS should be retrofitted (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;54, 9&hyph;3,
9&hyph;13; Tr. W1 22). The West Virginia Forestry Association safety committee said that retrofitting was necessary
because operators were exposed to ``extreme danger'' if machines were used in the woods without such protective devices
(Ex. 5&hyph;54). In addition to the safety necessity of retrofitting, the committee said that retrofitting was economically
feasible for the industry as whole.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters, on the other hand, while supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ROPS and FOPS requirements for new machines, opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofitting older machinery (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;57,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;17; Tr. W1 203, OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
170). Their opposition was based on several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, commenters said that machines should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be retrofitted to meet current standards when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the installed ROPS and/or FOPS met industry standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect at the time of manufacture (Ex. 5&hyph;22; Tr. W1 203, OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
170). One commenter said that older machines in the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry were equipped with rollover protection, but those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine structures still in service do not meet the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry standards (Ex. 5&hyph;22). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, some commenters said that retrofitting machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be very burdensome and costly, especially given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited useful life of such machines (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;5). They said retrofitting would be expensive because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require complete rebuilding and testing of the frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure. These commenters also said that employers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to hire outside contractors to test the retrofitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment since most employers did not have the personnel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise or equipment to install and test protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structures (Ex. 5&hyph;35). In addition, other commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the retrofitting requirement would be too burdensome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for small employers, both in terms of absorbing the cost in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small operations and in finding persons who could do the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofitting (Tr. OR 119, 263, 307). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, commenters indicated that the retrofitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement was not essential since most of the machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the proposed standard already are manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ROPS and FOPS as standard equipment (Tr. W1 184, 203, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 170). For example, most log-skidders manufactured after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1974 have ROPS and FOPS meeting the performance criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most mobile equipment used in the Southeastern United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already has ROPS or FOPS (Ex. 5&hyph;19). Other commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that skidders now come with fully enclosed cabs (Tr. W1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all the comments and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in the rulemaking record, OSHA has decided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several reasons not to require machines placed into service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the effective date of this standard to be retrofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ROPS and FOPS, provided that ROPS and FOPS have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been removed from machines so equipped at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture. First, OSHA has determined that many of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines currently in use already have protective structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting various performance criteria. The final standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that these protective structures continue to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained throughout the useful life of the machine, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they be replaced where they have been removed (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed after machine accident). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, many machines currently in use and virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all machines recently manufactured meet the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria specified in the proposed standard (Ex. 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
185&hyph;87). OSHA believes that older machines, that either do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have protective structures or have ROPS and FOPS meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier standards, are few in number and are rapidly nearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of their useful life. As such, OSHA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most employers are substantially in compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for machine protective structures and will reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full compliance in short period of time. Therefore, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that compliance with the protective structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement can be achieved without requiring retrofitting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Incorporation of standards by reference. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice, OSHA requested comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness of incorporating by reference updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus standards governing machine protective devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed standard OSHA required ROPS and FOPS to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed, tested and maintained in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following SAE national consensus standards: SAE 1040c June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1979 ``Performance Criteria or Rollover Protective Structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Machines'' and J231 Jan 1981 ``Minimum Performance Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS).'' The SAE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ROPS standard was updated in 1988 as was the SAE standard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters discussed incorporation of updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. W1 203). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most emphasized the need to reference the most up-to-date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in the final rule. In addition, two commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said OSHA should allow the use of standards from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards producing bodies, such as the International 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organization for Standardization (ISO) (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters also recommended that OSHA harmonize its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory language with ISO and Mine Safety and Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration protective structure standards (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;22). However, two commenters opposed incorporation
by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference because they contend that other standards may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have followed the same notice and public comment rules as do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA standards (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has considered the comments and in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard the Agency has decided to incorporate by reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current SAE standards on ROPS and FOPS. While there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some comment about whether technical publications should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced in standards, OSHA believes it is better in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case to reference technical documents rather than spell out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the many specifications the documents contain. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final standard is not requiring employers to retrofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines, it is more important for employers to know that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new machines they purchase meet the SAE standards. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer and not the employer who will have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise, personnel and equipment to do the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation and testing of the protective structures as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the manufacturing process, and it is the label of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformance placed on the equipment by the manufacturer that

10. Manual felling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearing notice raised two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues regarding manual felling: should exceptions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut requirement be allowed, and where should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut be required to be made? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Undercut requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a provision requiring each manually felled tree to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be undercut. This provision also required that undercuts be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a size to guide the tree fall in the intended direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to minimize the possibility of splitting. The purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this provision was to prevent trees from splitting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kicking back, or falling in an unintended direction, thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuring an employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15; Tr. OR 485&hyph;88). One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[Undercutting] helps protect the feller from the butt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the tree riding back up the sawn notch and springing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backwards over the stump towards him if the tree is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felled uphill, or strikes something during its fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that pushes [the tree] backwards (Ex. 9&hyph;15)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, other commenters said OSHA should revise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut requirement in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;5; Tr. OR 265, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
284&hyph;88, 324&hyph;26). One commenter said OSHA should make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting a recommended practice in the final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow for innovations in cutting techniques and to allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of various production requirements for cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain types of wood (e.g., veneer). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters stated that OSHA should permit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception to the undercut requirement for manual felling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saplings or unmerchantable trees, that is, of trees with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small diameter at breast height (DBH) (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;46, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;5; Tr. OR 265, 284&hyph;88, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
324&hyph;26). These commenters said that the hazards OSHA was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempting to protect against do not exist for saplings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, undercuts are not necessary. For example, Mr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alex Hanson, of AOL, stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On the smaller, nonmerchantable timber that's two, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three, four, five, six inches, generally not very tall, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 foot or less or maybe taller, and when you slash it, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
you push it over. It doesn't need a face to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the direction of fall.

[W]hen trees start getting to be merchantable size, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then you have safety problems. You get a seven inch or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over tree, you want to know where it's going. You 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
don't want to have it just fall anywhere.

[Y]ou have to buck those merchantable trees. You have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cut the top out so you just don't want them going 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
everywhere. You want things in line. And if they're 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
everywhere, then it increases the risk for the buckers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally it's the same guy who is falling it, but you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
want to have things in an orderly fashion so that he's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not having to go everywhere to buck the top. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they're just slashing it, it doesn't really matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where it goes because you're not having to go out there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and limb and cut the tops out and create another hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for yourself (Tr. OR 265, 284&hyph;88).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, other commenters disagreed with AOL about what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size tree requires an undercut. One commenter said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercuts are necessary for any tree that has more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-inch base (Ex. 9&hyph;16), while another commenter said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercuts were not necessary for trees with a seven-inch DBH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. OR 421&hyph;22). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APA, however, said that even trees with a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DBH should be undercut: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
You heard from one of the associations who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending that with regard to what I call undercuts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they're also called face cuts, that they not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required on very small trees, and there was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion and possibly a recommendation of an 8-inch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 7-inch size limit. Unfortunately, I don't have any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. But we do know and I will watch to see if I can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find any and submit it post hearing. I went through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our files and could not find anything. But it is our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perception, after studying these operations, that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree that's 8 inches in diameter at breast height is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably about 12 inches in diameter at the stump, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it's an oak tree or a Douglas fir tree that's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 feet tall and 8 inches and 12, it's a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass of wood that is difficult to control to get on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground and could cause and probably has caused injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maybe even deaths. There's enough mass there with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 60-foot tree ripping down, uncontrolled in its fall, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cause a death. And you heard from the Montana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
folks, that they have a little bit of a problem with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that too (Tr. OR 485&hyph;88). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, some commenters opposing the undercut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement also admitted that undercuts were necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any merchantable tree, regardless of its size. They said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that whenever a tree has a merchantable stem for a sawlog 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, it must be undercut to protect the fiber recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. OR 422, 487&hyph;88). They said undercutting was essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both for production reasons and safety considerations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees bucking the felled tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the evidence in the record, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes a provision requiring that each tree manually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felled be undercut is necessary to protect employees from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury. According to the WIR survey, four percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees injured said they had been using the wrong cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method at the time of their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCI report indicated that 10 fellers were injured because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misjudgments in cutting the tree (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, undercutting helps protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feller from injury by reducing the potential for the tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splitting and falling in an unintended direction or kicking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back towards the feller. In the final rule, OSHA is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing an exception to the undercutting requirement when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer demonstrates that felling the particular tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without an undercut will not create a hazard for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee. OSHA believes that when the hazards of splitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees, tree kickback and misdirected falls are not present, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it may be appropriate to manually fell a tree without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of demonstrating that the hazards discussed in this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not present. OSHA also notes that the employers cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make a blanket determination that trees of a particular size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
never pose the hazards discussed above if manually felled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without an undercut. The condition of the tree and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding area may make manually felling even a small a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree hazardous if it is not first undercut. The tree and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those conditions must be assessed on a case by case basis to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether felling the tree without making an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut would create a hazard for an employee.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For two reasons, however, OSHA has decided against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying an undercut exception for trees of a certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size. First, there is no agreement among the commenters on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what size tree could be safely exempted from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting requirement. There is evidence in the record, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that manually felling trees of the size that some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
say should be exempted from the requirement can pose a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious hazard to fellers (Tr. OR 265&hyph;69, 485&hyph;88). Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while commenters agreed that unmerchantable trees did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require undercutting, none agreed on what size tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituted an unmerchantable tree. The estimates of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes were considered to be merchantable trees varied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greatly, from 3 to 10 inches DBH, depending on the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wood being harvested (Ex. 5&hyph;46; Tr. OR 265, 485&hyph;88). And, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as some commenters have pointed out, trees included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of sizes can pose hazards to fellers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, some commenters said that any tree that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered merchantable is undercut, even if it is within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the range of sizes that commenters say should be exempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to commenters the undercut is also made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merchantable trees to prevent splitting of the product (Tr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 284&hyph;88). As such, undercutting may be done on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees in any event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does note that in many cases when trees are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be unmerchantable they are not manually felled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but rather slashed by mechanical means (Tr. OR 265, 268&hyph;69, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
285&hyph;87, 421&hyph;22). This provision on undercutting does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to trees felled by mechanical means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Backcut requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The second issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding manual felling on which OSHA requested comment was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where backcuts should be required to be made. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standard, OSHA required that backcuts be made above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the horizontal cut of the undercut. The 1978 ANSI logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and various State logging standards contain similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (e.g., Ex. 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported the proposed requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15). These commenters said a backcut above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal cut is necessary to assure that the tree does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fall in an unintended direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other commenters said OSHA should permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcuts to be at the same level or below the level of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut (Ex. 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;52, 9&hyph;1; Tr. W2 229&hyph;31, OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
395&hyph;96, 421&hyph;24, 499&hyph;500). Some said that a same level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut was more effective:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Backcuts should be made on the same level as the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the notch of the undercut. The hinge is what keeps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tree from kicking back, not the fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut is higher than the undercut. High backcuts run 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of cutting off the hinge, actually increasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the danger of kickback (Ex. 5&hyph;52).

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters said that backcuts above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal cut were not as critical when using the Humboldt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting method (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15). They said that when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the slanting cut of the undercut is angled downward, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree is more likely to fall in the intended direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without kicking back. However, one of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admitted that placing the backcut at the same level as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal cut when using the Humboldt undercut method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sacrificed safety for quality control: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Quality control concerns with several companies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dictate that only Humboldt undercuts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permissible with sawlog grade timber, so that wood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss is minimized by taking the notch wood out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stump. Quality control often dictates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there must be a flush surface on the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
log. To avoid having to make another cut to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
square up a log butt, fallers will attempt to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their backcuts meet the horizontal face cut as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely as possible. By doing this, they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sacrifice the safety of the step that would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been left on the stump to catch a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backwards-moving tree butt, and depend only on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downward-slanting face on the stump to hold the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree (Ex. 9&hyph;15).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters said the backcut requirement should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to those situations when tree kickback is a problem, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they contended was only on steep terrain, when felling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uphill or through trees (Ex. 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;4). Other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said that believed that the standard should provide more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility because variations frequently found on logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites, such as lean of the tree and type of terrain, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make strict adherence to the regulation difficult (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;22; Tr. OR 206&hyph;7, 395&hyph;96). These commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the cutting decisions should be left to the judgment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the experienced feller. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect fellers from being hit or crushed by the tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are felling. As discussed above, the record shows that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries and fatalities have occurred because of improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutting methods. The purpose of undercutting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcutting trees is to prevent the tree from splitting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felling an unintended direction or kicking back into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feller. OSHA agrees with ANSI and the various State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect employees against these hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not agree that backcutting should be limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to those situations when tree kickback can occur. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record shows that hazards other than tree kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessitate the backcut requirement. Without appropriately-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed backcuts, trees are more likely to split and/or fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an unintended direction. While OSHA agrees that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more likely that this could happen when trees are felled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uphill, OSHA also believes the record shows that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility exists regardless of the terrain. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the WIR survey, the single largest cause of injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported was being hit by a falling tree (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-half of all injuries reported were due to employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being hit or crushed by a falling tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule OSHA has provided an exception to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut requirement. The final rule allows the backcut to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be placed at or below the horizontal cut in tree pulling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. Various State logging standards also provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this exception to the backcut requirement (e.g., Ex. 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes this exception covers those situations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a special cutting technique may be required, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Federal agencies.

V. Summary and Explanation of the Final Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revision of the pulpwood logging standard was undertaken in response to the concern on the part of OSHA to the number
of fatalities and injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. The industry itself admits that logging is
a high hazard industry. As discussed above, the injury and fatality incidence rates in the logging industry are among
the highest industry incidence rates in the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSHA pulpwood logging standard, 1910.266, addressed only the hazards that exist in the pulpwood logging industry.
However, examination of the descriptions of accidents and other information available to the Agency indicates that
the same hazards exist for employees performing logging operations regardless of the end use of the harvested trees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the need for a comprehensive logging standard (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;41, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;59, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65,
5&hyph;69; Tr. W1 pg 21, 73, 202). For example, one commenter said that in Maine it has generally been acknowledged
that both products (pulpwood logs and logs used for other purposes) come off the same job (Ex. 5&hyph;46). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule provides protection for all loggers involved in timber harvesting, including loggers employed as
part of a mill operation, regardless of the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, pulpwood, chips,
etc.). This standard fills the current gap in coverage by providing a basic level of protection for all loggers. OSHA
has changed the title of 1910.266 from ``Pulpwood Logging'' to ``Logging Operations'' in order to reflect the wider
coverage of this revised standard. In addition, OSHA has added and/or modified various provisions of the pulpwood
logging standard to address more adequately the hazards faced in different aspects of logging operations. OSHA also
has updated equipment specification requirements in the revised standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the development of the revised standard, the Agency strove to promulgate a final rule that is effective,
and that is simple, concise, enforceable, and sustainable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Paragraph (a) Table of Contents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has added a table of contents to aid employers and other persons in using the revised standard. The table of contents
identifies the provisions that are included in the final standard and where specific requirements can be found. The
table of contents also is included because the final standard represents a significant reorganization of the elements
of the pulpwood logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The identification of the major paragraphs will, hopefully, aid persons in reading and understanding the requirements
of this final rule. In order to add the table of contents, each of the subsequent paragraphs had to be renumbered. The
paragraph references in the following discussion of the individual provisions of the standard are to the paragraphs
of the final rule, unless otherwise noted.

Paragraph (b) Scope and Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph defines the scope and application of this standard. The existing standard applied only to pulpwood
logging operations. That standard adopted, pursuant to section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the
American National Standards Institute, ANSI 03.1&hyph;1971 Safety Standard for Pulpwood Logging (hereafter 1971
ANSI standard) (Ex 2&hyph;13). Included in the 1971 ANSI standard were requirements for important safety practices
along with provisions pertaining to personal protective equipment, first aid and stationary and mobile equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When ANSI revised the 1971 consensus standard in 1978, they expanded the scope of the standard to include all logging
operations. The revised ANSI standard adopted, virtually unchanged, many of the requirements of the 1971 pulpwood
logging standard, and applied those provisions to all logging operations throughout the nation. OSHA has taken a
similar approach in this rulemaking. In paragraph (b)(1), the Agency has expanded the scope of the pulpwood logging
standard, 1910.266, and to cover all logging operations regardless of the end use of the timber products.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule, OSHA makes clear that the standard applies to all types of logging
operations, regardless of the end use of the wood. Logging operations, as defined in paragraph (c) of the final rule,
include, but are not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking, chipping, yarding, loading, unloading,
storing, transporting machines and equipment from one site to another, and other operations associated with felling
and moving trees and logs from the stump to the point of delivery. Many commenters supported the application of the
standard to all types of logging and all logging operations (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;48, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said OSHA should exclude felling operations from the logging standard and cover only the movement of
felled trees from the stump to the mill (Ex. 17). This commenter said that felling activity is not the most hazardous
part of logging operations. OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters' recommendation. The record
clearly shows that felling activities are the most hazardous activities of the logging operation. According to the
WIR survey, more than one-half of all reported injuries involved various felling activities (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA
believes that if the standard did not include hazards associated with felling the trees, that the majority of employees
in the logging industry would still be exposed to significant risk of injury and death. Therefore, in the final OSHA
has retained coverage of tree felling operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter raised the issue about whether establishments that hire independent contractors to perform various
logging activities are considered employers covered by this standard (Ex. 5&hyph;23). The courts have held in various
OSHA cases that when the contractor exercises control over the means and methods by which the independent contractor
performs the work, that the contractor is regarded as an employer for purposes of this rule.

job is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, the Agency has excluded from coverage the construction or use of cable yarding
systems. Cable yarding, as defined in the final standard, is the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where
they are felled to the landing on a system composed of a cable suspended from spars and/or towers. The definition further
states that the trees or logs may be either dragged across the ground by the cable or carried while suspended from the
cable. One of the end towers is located in the area where the trees or logs are attached to the cable yarding system and
the other end is at the landing. Cable yarding systems are used primarily when the terrain is extremely rugged and the
felled trees and logs are otherwise inaccessible. Important elements of the safe use of a cable yarding system include
the selection and use of climbing devices to install the system, preparation of head and tail spars and intermediate
trees or towers, component sizing, system rigging and system usage. There are generally three types of cable yarding
systems, namely, high lead, skyline and slackline. In a high lead system, the mainline is threaded through the mainline
block (pulley) that is attached near the top of the spar to obtain a lift of the logs being yarded. A skyline system is
one in which the line (cable) is hung between two or more supports on which a carriage or block travels. A slackline system
is a form of skyline system where the skyline is spooled on a drum so that the line can be raised or lowered. In all three
systems, the spars are usually held in part and restrained against movement by the use of guylines that are anchored
to the ground or another tree. Trees and logs may be moved by a cable yarding system by dragging them along the ground
or while they are suspended from the system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble of the proposed rule, OSHA explained that this exemption was included due to the regional nature of
the use of cable logging systems. State plan States in the far west that have the most significant cable logging activity
have developed very detailed cable logging standards. Many commenters testified that the hazards of cable yarding
in those states have been adequately covered by the specific state standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20,
2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;23, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 38J, 38K). However,
some commenters discussed the need for increased regulation of cable yarding operations on the national level because
they assert there is increasing use of cable yarding in non-western regions of the country where no State standards
exist (Ex 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;36). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments, OSHA has decided to retain the exclusion for cable yarding operations
in this final rule for several reasons. First, the State logging standards that address cable yarding are detailed
specification standards that adequately address the unique hazards associated with the construction and use of
cable yarding in those particular States, that are all western States. For example, those standards deal with construction
of cable yarding systems on steep slopes that are predominently in those western States. Those State cable yarding
standards will not be affected by the Federal logging standard. Second, there is no evidence in this rulemaking record
that those standards are not addressing particular hazards associated with cable yarding in those States. Third,
OSHA agrees with the APA that the prevalent use of cable yarding is in those States that have their own standards that
include requirements for cable yarding. None of the commenters representing non-western logging establishments
indicated that cable yarding is being performed in their area or by their member companies. Fourth, OSHA believes
there is not sufficient information and data in the record regarding cable yarding activities in non-western States
to determine at this point whether the various cable yarding regulations of the western States would be appropriate
to apply nationwide. For example, logging in western States is usually clear cut logging while selective cutting
is more prominent in non-western states (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Other logging conditions vary across regions, such as tree
size and type, weather, and terrain. For example, logging operations in western States are three times more likely
to be on steep slopes, where skidding may be impossible (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that these differences might
affect what would constitute appropriate cable yarding rules for non-western States. Therefore, OSHA believes
this issue requires further study before the Agency promulgates a national cable yarding standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, OSHA emphasizes that the exclusion of cable yarding is only for the construction and use of the cable yarding
system itself. Other parts of the logging operation taking place where cable yarding systems are present will be covered
by this standard. Just as this standard extends the pulpwood logging standard to cover the same hazards experienced
elsewhere in the logging industry, OSHA believes that these same hazards need to be covered by this standard when cable
yarding operations are being performed. For example, the hazards for loggers felling trees exist regardless of how
the trees or logs are moved about the work site. To this end, the Agency has included in the final standard the felling
of the trees and the other operations that are conducted in conjunction with the use of a cable yarding system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that the use of yarding machines with winches for playing out and retrieving cable is not considered
cable yarding for the purposes of this standard. Therefore, this operation is covered by this final logging standard.
In this type of log retrieval, a yarding machine plays out cable, to which is attached a choker sling that is secured
to a tree or log. Once the sling is attached to the log, the cable is wound onto the drum and the tree or log is then yarded
by skidding while attached to and supported by the cable on the winch. This system of yarding is oftentimes used when
logging is being conducted along a roadway or other area where access to the area where the tree is felled is not practical
and the area where the yarder (skidder) is operating is on the roadway or in an accessible area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (b)(3) of the final rule OSHA emphasizes that this standard is not a totally ``vertical'' standard for
logging operations. That is, the requirements of this final rule are to be supplemented by other applicable requirements
found elsewhere in part 1910. When there is a corresponding provision elsewhere in part 1910 that addresses the same
hazard or condition of work as a provision of the logging standard, the more specific logging provision takes precedence
for logging operations. By contrast, when hazardous working conditions are not addressed or covered by the logging
standard, the other requirements of part 1910 apply. For example, employers in the logging industry must provide
employees protection against occupational noise exposure by meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.95. Employers
in this industry must also comply with the permissible exposure limit for wood dust specified in 29 CFR 1910.1000 and
meet the field sanitation requirements of 29 CFR 1910.28. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised the issue about what standards apply to the construction of roads and trails (Ex. 5&hyph;16,
5&hyph;44, and 5&hyph;63). These commenters said there was confusion about whether the entire part 1926 would be
applied to logging operations. Construction activities such as the building of roads and trails are not logging operations,
therefore they are covered by applicable construction standards and not the logging standard. As such, the use and
maintenance of the equipment to perform the construction of those roads and trails, such as graders, scrapers, front-end
loaders, and bulldozers, are covered by the construction standards. In addition, the building of roads and trails
to reach logging sites is not a logging operation, but is a construction activity that is carried out preparatory to
the logging activity. Therefore, in this final standard OSHA has removed references to road building construction
activities. Road building in conjunction with the establishment of a logging activity is no different than road building
to gain access to any other operation and is covered in the general construction standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the felling of trees in preparation for the construction activities, such as the building of roads, is considered
to be a logging operation. To the extent that any employee is performing a logging operation in preparation for construction
activities, the employee is performing general industry work, and the requirements of this standard as well as other
applicable sections of part 1910, apply in order to safely fell those trees. For example, if trees are felled to prepare
for road construction, the requirements in this final rule and other sections of part 1910 apply. This reasoning also
applies to felling of trees in preparation for agricultural activities (e.g., felling trees to prepare land for crops).
Felling of those trees is general industry work and the requirements of this standard as well as other applicable sections
of part 1910 apply. To this end, OSHA has specifically referenced the applicability of the final logging standard
in 29 CFR Part 1928 to felling of trees in preparation of agricultural activities.

Paragraph (c) Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (c), OSHA is adopting a number of definitions to clarify the meaning, intent and purpose of certain terms
contained in this standard. Several definitions contained in the pulpwood logging rule were deleted from the proposed
rule because the terms were no longer used in the regulatory text. In addition, 17 new definitions were added to the
proposal. In the final rule OSHA has added and changed several definitions to better reflect the intent of the Agency
and to aid interested persons in understanding the requirements of this standard. In addition, in the final rule OSHA
has deleted several proposed definitions. Many of these terms involved cable yarding and road construction activities,
that are not covered by this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Cable yarding'' is defined in this final rule as the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where they are felled
to a landing by attaching them to a suspended cable system. The supports for the cable that carries or supports the trees
or logs are called head and tail spars. Spars may be fashioned from standing trees or from metal towers (commonly called
metal spars). There may be additional intermediate spars if the cable run is of sufficient length to require intermediate
support. OSHA has specifically defined ``cable yarding'' in the final rule to aid persons in understanding the scope
of the exclusion from the standard for this particular type of logging operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Danger tree'' is defined in the final rule as any standing tree that presents a hazard to an employee due to conditions
such as, but not limited to, deterioration or physical damage to the root system, trunk, stem or limbs, and the direction
and lean of the tree. The tree may be dead or alive. This term was not contained in the proposed standard. Instead, the
related term ``snag'' was included and defined as any dead tree or portion thereof remaining standing. Also, the term
``widow maker'' was included in the proposed rule and defined as an overhanging limb or section of tree that could become
dislodged and drop to the ground. Several commenters said this term should replace the use of ``snag'' in the proposed
rule because the definition of snag implies that all dead trees are dangerous (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;64,
17). Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, from the State of Washington, said that not all snags were dangerous to employees and many
were essential to the health of the wildlife community (Ex. 17). In this final rule, OSHA has decided to use the term
``danger tree,'' a term that is used in the State of Washington logging standard that is more inclusive of the various
conditions that could cause a tree to be dangerous (Ex. 2&hyph;22). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Designated person'' is defined in the final rule as an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience
to perform specific duties. This definition is a close parallel to the definition of the term used in consensus standards
dealing with material handling equipment, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME B30.5&hyph;1989
with Addenda, ``Safety Standard for Mobile Cranes'' (Ex. 38DD and EE). In the ASME standard, a designated person is
defined as an employee who is selected or assigned by the employer as being competent to perform specific duties. In
this final rule, the Agency has amended that definition to indicate that the employee needs to have the knowledge,
training and experience to perform that job or duty for which he/she is designated. The possession of those attributes
is not a discretionary decision on the part of the employer but a mandatory prerequisite that the employee must possess.
Knowledge and competency are normally achieved through training or experience or a combination of those activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule a signal person, an explosive handler and user, a machine operator, a trainer, and a supervisor of
new and newly-trained employees must be designated persons. In these cases, the Agency recognizes that each of those
individuals must have knowledge, experience, and training to competently perform those tasks. For example, a signal
person needs to know the various signals to use when indicating that a particular operation or movement is to be made.
The signal person also must know and understand how the task is to be performed and the role of his signals in completing
the task safely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Domino felling'' is defined in the final rule as the partial cutting of several trees that are left standing and then
pushed over with a pusher tree. Domino felling is a dangerous practice that is prohibited by the final standard. When
one tree falls into or against another tree, the direction of fall of each tree may be altered to the point that either
tree may fall in an unexpected, and oftentimes, dangerous location. Whenever one tree is being felled and it strikes
another tree, the base of the tree being felled can kick back, striking the feller who has not moved away sufficiently
from the tree being felled. Additionally, one tree falling into another tree can result in the initial tree becoming
lodged in the second tree, thereby making it necessary for an employee to remove the lodged tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Health care provider'' is defined in this final rule as a health care practitioner operating within the scope of
his/her license, certificate, registration or legally authorized practice. As used in this standard, health care
providers are practitioners whose authorization qualifies them to approve first-aid kits that are to be used in the
logging industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Log'' has been defined in the final rule as a segment sawed or split from a felled tree. This term replaces the terms
section, log, bolt and tree length, that were all used in the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard.
The usual practice in the harvesting of large and/or tall trees is to cut them into shorter, more manageable lengths
before they are yarded so that they may be more easily handled and transported. In some cases, extremely large diameter
trees may be split lengthwise so that they can be handled and transported to the mill for further processing. Although
the practice of splitting a very large tree is not as common, the Agency has included a log as any section of tree, whether
that section has been cut or split from a tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Logging operations'' is defined in the final standard as operations associated with felling and moving trees and
logs from the stump to the point of delivery, such as, but not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking,
chipping, yarding, loading, unloading, storing, and transporting machines, equipment and personnel from one site
to another. The proposed rule did not define logging operations. OSHA has included this definition in the final rule
to emphasize that this standard covers those operations involving the felling and moving of felled trees, as opposed
to other operations, such as road building that are preparatory to rather than part of logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Machine'' is defined in the final standard as a piece of equipment having a self contained powerplant that is operated
off-road and is used for the movement of materials. Machines include tractors, skidders, front-end loaders, scrapers,
graders, bulldozers, swing yarders, log stackers and mechanical felling devices, such as tree shears and feller-bunchers.
In the pulpwood logging and proposed standards, terms such as ``machine'' and ``equipment'' were used interchangeably
to describe a piece of equipment that is intended to be operated off-road and is used primarily for the movement of material.
Some commenters said they were confused about whether ``vehicles'' were included within the term ``mobile equipment,''
that had been broadly defined as the kind of equipment which includes mobility as part of its work function. Because
of the potential for confusion regarding the intention of the Agency in proposing requirements for off-road versus
on-road equipment, the Agency has defined both the terms ``machine'' and ``vehicle.'' The intent of the Agency in
including these terms is to distinguish between machines, whose primary area of operation is off-road and are primarily
material movers, and vehicles that include personnel and material conveyances operated on highways as well as off-road.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operators of many vehicles (primarily trucks, tractor/trailers and buses) require special licenses or endorsements
to qualify as an operator of that type vehicle. In contrast, machine operators usually do not have to possess a special
license. Therefore, OSHA is defining and imposing different logging-related requirements for the operation of
machines and vehicles. The use of the term ``machine'' as used in this standard should not be confused with the use of
that term elsewhere in these general industry standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Rated capacity'' is defined in the final rule as the maximum load that a piece of material handling equipment can
safely lift and move. This is a term that is commonly used when describing the capability of a piece of material handling
equipment. The rated capacity of a piece of material handling equipment is initially determined by the manufacturer
and documented in the operators manual and on the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Serviceable condition'' is defined in this final rule as that quality of a tool, machine, vehicle, or other device
to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer to operate. OSHA believes that there are many conditions that can
exist with a piece of equipment that would make it unserviceable, as well as other conditions that would not similarly
qualify. For example, seat covering material on a tractor that has become cracked, although uncomfortable, would
not normally qualify as a condition that would make the machine unserviceable. On the other hand, worn brakes or a leak
in the brake system would definitely make a machine or vehicle unserviceable. Additionally, cracked or broken gauges
and defective or leaking fuel systems are other conditions that would render a machine or vehicle unserviceable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of personal protective equipment, head protection that has a crack that would compromise the ability of
the hard hat to absorb further impact without injuring the employee is an example of an unserviceable condition. On
the other hand, a small dent in a hard hat would not necessarily render the head protection unserviceable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Tie down'' is defined in the final rule as an assemblage of binder and strapping (either chain, cable, steel strips
or fiber webbing) that is used to secure a load to the bed of a transport vehicle. In the proposed rule, OSHA used the term
``binder'' to indicate the assembly that is used to secure a load to a vehicle during transport of that load. As pointed
out by two commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;7; Tr. OR 20), a binder is a component of a tie down and is the ratchet assembly that
is used to secure and tighten the strapping of the tie down. In this final rule, the Agency has corrected the definition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Vehicle'' is defined as a personnel conveyance and/or material handling equipment. Included are cars, buses,
trucks, trailers and semi-trailers. Although vehicles normally operate on public roads, their use is not limited
to that environment. Any of these pieces of equipment may operate not only on public roads, but may also be used to transport
personnel or materials off-road. For example, when a logging truck or tractor/trailer is moving a load of trees or
logs, the vehicle may have to traverse not only the logging trails or roads, but may have to operate on the public thoroughfares
to deliver its load to the mill or other off-loading point. This final rule covers the logging operation from the site
of the felling of the trees to the point of delivery of the trees or logs.

Paragraph (d) General Requirements

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in the general requirements paragraph of the final rule are requirements for personal protective equipment,
seat belts, first aid, fire extinguishers, environmental conditions, work areas, signaling and signal equipment,
overhead electric lines, flammable and combustible liquids and explosives and blasting agents.

Personal Protective Equipment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1) contain requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE), including its use and maintenance,
and the inspection of PPE before its use during a workshift. Paragraph (d)(1) also specifies when employees must use
gloves, leg protection, logging boots, head protection, and eye and face protection. This final rule, however, does
not contain requirements for other types of personal protective equipment that are covered by other general industry
requirements contained elsewhere in part 1910 (i.e., hearing protection and respiratory protection). Paragraph
(b)(3) already makes clear that other requirements contained in part 1910 automatically apply when the logging standard
has not addressed a particular hazard or working condition. Therefore, since part 1910 already require the use and
maintenance of PPE, OSHA has included in paragraph (d)(1) only those items of personal protective equipment that
are not contained elsewhere in that part or that are in some way different from the requirements contained in elsewhere
in part 1910. As such, references to respiratory protection in subpart I of part 1910 and hearing protection at &sect;1910.95
have been deleted from this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable
condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the PPE is provided by the employer or provided by the employee.
One commenter recommended that OSHA include this provision in the final rule (Tr. W2 195). This provision parallels
the maintenance requirements of the general industry PPE standards. Specifically, 1910.132(b) also requires that
when employees are allowed to provide their own PPE, the employer is still responsible for assuring its proper maintenance.
OSHA has recognized that whether or not the employer pays for particular types of PPE that must be worn in the workplace,
the employer is responsible for assuring that required PPE is adequately protecting employees from workplace hazards.
The only way for the employer to assure that PPE adequately protects employees from workplace hazards is to inspect
the PPE and maintain it in the condition that it was intended by the manufacturer. The final rule, in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)
(PPE maintenance) and (ii) (PPE inspection), imposes such responsibilities directly on the employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable condition, paragraph (d)(1)(ii) requires that the employer
assure that all PPE be inspected before initial use during each workshift. This inspection will assist employers
in identifying whether any PPE is not functioning properly so that unserviceable equipment can be repaired or replaced.
This paragraph also requires that before work is commenced, the employer must repair defects or damage, or replace
the PPE. The Agency considers defects and damage to be conditions that detract from the ability of the product to perform
its intended function. For example, worn cuffs on leg protection that do not compromise the ability of the leg protection
to resist chain-saw cuts, is not a defect or damage within the meaning of this standard. However, a cut of the leg protection
and loss of the fibrous material that is used to resist the chain saw would definitely be a defect or damage. When there
is a defect or damage, the PPE must be repaired so that the condition no longer affects the serviceability of the item
or the item must be replaced before work commences.

Discussed below are the specific PPE requirements of the final rule. OSHA notes that each of the requirements of paragraphs
(d)(1)(iv) through (vii) require that the employer assures that the employee wears PPE meeting the requirement of
the final rule. It is the responsibility of the employer to assure that serviceable PPE is available and worn by employees
when required by the final rule. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, with the exception of logging boots,
these specific PPE requirements impose on the employer the obligation to provide such PPE at no cost to the employee.

Gloves

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this final rule requires that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee, and assure
that each employee handling wire rope wears cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection. In the proposed rule,
OSHA specified that the employer provide hand protection consisting of suitable heavy-duty puncture-resistant
gloves when employees were working with wire rope. Several State logging standards also require the use of gloves
for employees working with wire rope (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments regarding the proposed requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27,
5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54,
5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. OR 104). Many commenters objected to the requiring the use
of puncture resistant gloves, such as leather gloves, for logging operations. First, commenters argued that there
are no gloves that are puncture resistant in all circumstances (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 104). They argued that wire rope
can puncture even leather gloves. Second, several commenters indicated that cotton gloves have become the industry
standard and that their experience had shown that medium weight cotton gloves are considered safer than leather gloves
in logging operations when punctures can occur. According to these commenters, cotton gloves give the logger a better
feel of jaggers (broken wires in a wire rope) when they penetrate so the logger is able to quickly let go of the wire rope
(Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). They added that break-away gloves are imperative when the wire rope
travels at high speed and reaction time is critical (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). They said that cotton gloves,
but not leather gloves, will tear away from the hand when caught by a jagger rather than forcibly pulling the hand along
with the jagger, causing the employee to fall and possibly into the path of the log (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). These commenters argued that pulling of the hand and glove could make a minor hand injury more serious
such as making a small puncture wound a tear or laceration of the skin (Ex. 5&hyph;29). Third, one commenter indicated
that cotton gloves provide adequate protection because a review of their recordable accidents since 1982 indicated
that no employee wearing cotton gloves while handling wire rope had suffered an injury requiring medical attention
(Ex. 5&hyph;45). Fourth, these commenters said leather gloves are generally considered hazardous for logging operations
because they do not have good gripping ability on cable when wet (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;46).
These commenters asserted that cotton gloves provided better gripping ability in the same circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, commenters argued that the required gloves must be applicable and efficient for a wide range of logging activities.
One commenter pointed out that employees who use saws also work with wire rope, and very few will take the time to change
gloves between each operation (Ex. 5&hyph;35). For these reasons, OSHA has, in this final rule, changed the requirement
for the use of hand protection to specify that cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection must be worn when handling
wire rope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Leg protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee,
and assure that each employee who operates a chain saw wears leg protection. This paragraph requires that the leg protection
be comprised of ballistic nylon or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection.
In addition, this paragraph requires that the leg protection cover the full length of the thigh to the top of the boot
on each leg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pulpwood logging standard did not have a requirement for the use of chaps or other leg protection. The proposed
rule would have required that chain-saw operators wear ballistic nylon or equivalent protection covering each leg
from upper thigh to boot top or shoe top. Both the State of Washington and the State of Oregon logging standards require
the use of leg protection by chain-saw operators (Ex. 2&hyph;22, 38K).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for and the use of leg protection was one of the issues raised in the hearing notice and has been discussed above
in the Major Issues section. The evidence in the record, as discussed above, strongly supports the need for a requirement
for leg protection for each chain saw operator in order to protect that operator against being injured by contact with
a moving saw chain. OSHA points out that the requirement for using leg protection applies to each employee who operates
any chain saw at any time on the job. This requirement includes the employee who is a regular chain saw operator as well
as the employee who occasionally uses a chain saw. Some commenters emphasized the need for any employee who uses a chain
saw, even occasionally, to wear leg protection (Tr. W1 193, W2 61, 115). Other commenters said OSHA should provide
an exception for employees who operate chains saws only occasionally (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;59). The Agency believes
that an employee who operates a chain saw for any duration needs leg protection. OSHA also notes that there were no comments
received saying leg protection was too burdensome for infrequent operators or for short duration use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this paragraph, OSHA also has included an exception to the leg protection requirement for employees working from
bucket trucks and, in some instances, for climbers. OSHA has allowed the exception for those working in bucket trucks,
because the bucket work platform provides the necessary protection for these chain saw operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to climbers, OSHA has retained an exception in the final rule for certain situations. Climbers are not
required to wear leg protection when the employer demonstrates that a greater hazard is posed by wearing leg protection
in the particular situation. As the final rule makes clear, this is not a blanket exception for climbers. The employer
must evaluate the particular situation to determine whether there is a greater risk to the climber by wearing leg protection.
OSHA points out that the employer will bear the burden of demonstrating that leg protection poses a greater hazard
for the climber. OSHA received one comment that said leg protection should not be required because it was a hindrance
during tree climbing (Ex. 5&hyph;7). The fact that leg protection may be a ``hindrance'' is not in itself a showing
that leg protection poses a greater danger. When the hindrance is just that climbing goes more slowly when leg protection
is worn, the employer has not made the requisite showing that leg protection poses greater safety hazards. However,
when the employer shows that in wet conditions leg protection would substantially increase the likelihood of falling,
it may be appropriate in that case for the climber to refrain from using leg protection. In such cases, OSHA believes
that alternative methods for protecting the legs, such as light and pliable pads sewn into work pants, should be used
whenever feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foot protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each employee wear foot protection,
such as heavy duty logging boots. This provision requires that the foot protection be waterproof or water repellant,
cover and provide support for the ankle, and protect the employee against chain-saw penetration. This paragraph
allows employees to wear sharp, calk-soled boots, or other slip-resistant boots, when the employer demonstrates
that they are necessary for the job, terrain, timber type, or weather conditions. However, this alternative foot
protection must otherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that when the logging boot itself does not provide protection from penetration by a chain saw, the employee
must use some additional foot protection, such as a foot cover, to provide that necessary protection. Information
in the record indicates such devices are commercially available in the logging industry, therefore, this provision
should not prove burdensome (Ex. 5&hyph;14).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the proposed and pulpwood logging standards contained provisions requiring that safety boots or shoes (excluding
low cut shoes) meet ANSI Safety Standards for Men's Safety-Toe Footwear. The proposal also would have allowed heavy
duty logging style boots with lug or calk soles to be worn when they are appropriate for the job, the terrain, the timber
type and weather conditions. Several State logging standards also require that employees wear logging boots (Ex.
2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there was considerable comment on the proposed safety boot requirement, commenters generally supported the
need for a safety boot provision (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;24, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29,
5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;67, Tr. W1 63, 110, W2 115,
139). OSHA received the most comment on the issue of who must provide and pay for the safety boots. That issue has been
discussed at length above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also received considerable comment opposing the incorporation of the ANSI Z41.1 standard on safety shoes (Tr.
W1 147&hyph;148). Commenters from cold climate areas, such as Alaska, northern Washington, Idaho and Montana, opposed
the proposed requirement because they contended that the steel toes transmit the warmth produced by their feet, thereby
encouraging the onset of frostbite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several reasons, OSHA has used performance criteria rather than incorporating by reference any foot protection
standard. First, the ANSI standard permits low-cut shoes that do not cover the ankle or provide ankle support. Second,
the ANSI foot protection standard is a testing rule for steel toes of safety shoes. While falling objects may pose a
hazard for logging employees, the greater hazard is penetration of the boot by a chain saw. The ANSI standard does not
address this hazard and it does not provide adequate protection to the entire foot, which is necessary. In addition,
as discussed above, steel-toed boots may cause problems for loggers working in extreme cold. OSHA received comment
about efforts to develop, manufacture and market protective footwear with fiberglass rather than steel toes, but
there is no accepted standard yet. Third, the ANSI standard does not address hazards that are unique to the logging
industry, such as wet conditions and penetration of the boot by a chain saw. Fourth, there is no evidence in the record
of any other consensus standard regarding logging boots. OSHA is aware of efforts by various organizations and associations,
in conjunction with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), to develop test standards for personal
protective equipment that is intended to apply directly to loggers and the logging industry. These standards would
be similar to the various Canadian PPE standards developed by the Safety and Engineering Program Laboratory Services
(IRRST) (Ex. 5&hyph;72). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the Agency has specified that logging boots that meet certain performance criteria must be worn by each employee.
OSHA has reviewed the rulemaking record and determined some of the most important performance characteristics that
are needed in order to deal with particular hazards that are present in logging operations (e.g., steep and uneven
terrain, wet and cold weather, chain-saw kickback). For example, two hearing participants testified that logging
boots must provide ankle support for the employee (Tr. W1 147, OR 222). Coverage and support of the ankle is necessary
to protect against lacerations and to prevent ankle injury when navigating the rugged terrain that characterizes
much of the logging environment. One commenter also said that logging boots must be waterproof or water repellent
so that the logger would not be exposed to getting trench foot or immersion foot (Tr. W1 147). Finally, commenters said
logging boots must provide protection against penetration by a chain saw if contact is made with the boot (Tr. W1 148,
195, W2 139). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also supported the proposed provision allowing lug or calk-soled boots to be used (Ex. 5&hyph;19,
5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29). These commenters said that working conditions varied too greatly to require the use of one
type of boot sole for all logging regions. For example, one commenter said that calk boots are considered essential
for safe and secure walking on steep western forest terrain (Ex. 5&hyph;28). Another commenter stated that there
are situations in the south where smooth soled boots are adequate (Ex. 5&hyph;29). In addition, this commenter said
that there are conditions when calk boots might pose a greater danger, such as a machine operator who is continuously
mounting and dismounting a machine via steel platform steps where the calk boots could result in slipping or falling.
As a result, this commenter said that calk and sharp-soled boots should be limited to those situations when the type
of logging operation, terrain, timber size or weather conditions make their use appropriate. The U.S. Department
of the Interior also commented that calk-soled boots may contribute to certain types of logging injuries, such as
knee injuries (Ex. 5&hyph;50). Based on these comments, OSHA specifically allows sharp, calk-soled boots or other
slip-resistant type boots to be worn, provided the employer can demonstrate such boots are needed for the employee's
job, the terrain, the timber type or the weather conditions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for the employer to demonstrate that such footwear is necessary, the employer must prove that three conditions
are met: (1) that the footwear is appropriate for use in the work environment; (2) the employee's duties require him/her
to work where the footwear is needed; and (3) that the use of the alternative footwear does not make the work less safe.
For example, if the area where the logging is being done is moist to wet and has a dense leaf cover, the use of calk-soled
boots (boots with spiked soles) would provide the logger with additional traction when walking and working on that
ground cover. On the other hand, such footwear is not appropriate when a machine operator spends little time working
on the ground (even if the same conditions as described above prevail) since spikes make frequent mounting and demounting
of the machine more hazardous. OSHA recognizes that slips, trips and falls are a major source of injury in the logging
industry, accounting for one third of the injuries to loggers (Ex. 2&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is also requiring that when an employee wears calk-soled logging boots, the other foot protection requirements
of this paragraph must also be met. OSHA is aware that most calk-soled boots do not have steel-toes or other devices
that prevent penetration by a chain saw. However, OSHA is also aware that calk-soled boots are worn primarily by fellers
and buckers operating chain saws on steep terrain. Evidence in the record indicates that a vast majority of loggers
in western States, where the terrain is steep, wear calk-soled boots (Ex. 2&hyph;1). However, even in those States,
almost 20 percent of all injuries reported in the WIR survey involved chain saws. The vast majority of these injuries
happened when the logger was struck by the chain saw. Therefore, OSHA believes that it is necessary that even when an
employee wears calk-soled boots, he must also have foot protection providing protection against chain-saw penetration.
As stated above, when the boot itself does not provide that protection, the employee must wear some other device that
will provide the needed protection. The record shows there are such devices currently available on the market, therefore,
OSHA does not believe this additional requirement will be unduly burdensome (Ex. 5&hyph;14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Head protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring each employee who is at risk of injury from falling or flying
objects to wear head protection. The head protection must meet the requirements of newly-revised subpart I of part
1910. Both the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard contained head protection requirements. The
pulpwood logging standard had identified the performance criteria that head protection was required to meet, but
did not specifically require employees to wear it. The proposed standard added that requirement and updated the performance
criteria for the required head protection. Several State logging standards also require that employees wear head
protection (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing the required use of head protection and has retained the proposed provision
in the final standard. OSHA believes it is important to stress that in the logging industry head protection is necessary
to protect employees not only from falling objects, but also from flying objects. According to the WIR survey, 14 percent
of all injuries reported were to the head (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes this hazard is present especially for fellers,
chain saw operators and persons performing chipping operations, however, there are other logging operations where
the potential for head injury also exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eye and face protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each employee who works in an area where there is a potential
for injury due to falling or flying object shall wear eye and face protection meeting the requirements of subpart I
of part 1910. This provision permits logger-type mesh screen to be worn when the employer demonstrates it provides
equivalent protection. The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI standard contained a similar
requirement. Eye and face protection is also required by several State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19,
2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters said OSHA should require eye protection to be worn only in certain situations (Ex. 5&hyph;43 and 5&hyph;64).
One commenter stated:

This is a good rule for some logging activities, such as felling, bucking, splicing, etc.; however, we do not feel that
this is necessary for choker setting and many machine operators, such as yarder, loader, feller-bunchers (Ex. 5&hyph;64).

After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA believes that a requirement mandating eye and face protection is
necessary. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all injuries reported involved the eyes and face (Ex. 2&hyph;1).
In the final rule, OSHA is requiring only that such protection be worn whenever there is the potential for head injury
due to falling or flying objects. OSHA agrees with the commenters that the potential for eye and face injury is present
especially for fellers, buckers and chippers, however, there are other logging operations in which the potential
for this type of injury also exists. In any logging operations when there is no danger of being struck by falling or flying
objects, eye protection is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employers, under the PPE standard, will have to conduct a hazard assessment to determine when and where those hazards
may exist in the logging workplace. In some cases, the presence of the hazard will be obvious (e.g., fellers and buckers).
In other cases, working conditions may be such that there is no potential for injury (e.g., yarder operator working
inside an enclosed cab). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the head protection provision, OSHA has retained the eye and face protection provision to alert the industry
that falling objects, in addition to flying objects, are a hazard for employees in the logging industry.

First-Aid Kits

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that employers provide first-aid kits. The proposed standard
contained this provision. First aid kits are also required by every State Plan State logging standard. OSHA did not
receive any comments opposing this requirement in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule requires that first-aid kits be at each work site when felling is being conducted,
at each landing and on each employee transport vehicle. The proposed rule stated that first-aid kits be provided ``at
the work site.'' Several commenters said that OSHA should define the term ``work site'' (Ex. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53,
5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63) in the final rule. They also said that having kits available at the landing should provide adequate
protection. However, another commenter said chain-saw operators working away from the landing need first-aid kits
and should each be required to carry a small first-aid kit that contains supplies to stop bleeding (Ex. 5&hyph;28).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSHA has clarified its intention regarding having first-aid kits at each work site. First, the records
shows that first-aid kits are necessary at each work site when felling is being conducted and not just at landings.
According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at the cutting site, while only one-fifth
of the injuries were at landings (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that immediate assistance must be provided for injured
cutters. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, many logging establishments have central offices, but their
crews are performing operations miles from that central location. OSHA has received testimony that cutting crews
are often spread out and in remote locations (Ex. 5&hyph;34; Tr. OR 21). These commenters said crews are often located
more than one-half hour away from a central office or spread across five square miles. First-aid kits that require
that much time to access are of limited value to an injured employee. When an injury is severe, the lack of immediately
accessible first-aid materials and trained personnel could result in permanent disability or death. Therefore,
OSHA is requiring that first-aid kits be provided at each work site where trees are being felled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, OSHA is also requiring first-aid kits to be provided at each landing. As discussed above, one-fifth of all
injuries reported in the WIR survey occurred at landings (Ex. 2&hyph;1). First-aid kits at landings are also necessary
to provide assistance to other injured employees, such as those on skid trails. According to the WIR survey, nearly
one-fifth of employees injured were on skid trails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA is retaining the requirement from the proposed rule that first-aid kits be provided on each crew vehicle.
The WIR survey indicates that employees are injured on employer-built roads while enroute to and from work sites (Ex.
2&hyph;1). One commenter stated that requiring first-aid kits on each employee transport vehicle could result in
several kits being at each work site (Ex. 5&hyph;35). Nothing in the standard prohibits an employer from using the
employee transport vehicle kits by a felling crew during the workshift, provided they are returned to the crew vehicle
when it is moved at the end of the workshift.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule also requires that the employer, in determining the appropriate number and
contents of first-aid kits, to consider the degree of isolation of the work site, the number of employees at the work
site and the hazards reasonably anticipated at that work site. The further a crew is from a central landing, the more
crucial a first-aid kit is for that remote crew. For example, large and well-supplied first-aid kits are needed where
crews are so remotely located that rescue units (either vehicles or helicopters) cannot get to the injured person
or not get there quickly. When crews are very small and located close to central landings smaller kits may be adequate,
when supplemented by kits at central landing areas that contain a more comprehensive supply of first-aid materials.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (d)(2) (ii), (iii) and (iv) all deal with the adequacy of the contents of first-aid kits. At paragraph (d)(2)(ii)
of the final rule, OSHA has specified that each first-aid kit must meet certain minimum content requirements. Those
minimum content requirements are delineated in mandatory Appendix A. OSHA received comments urging OSHA to specify
the contents needed for an ``adequately supplied'' first-aid kit (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;50, 30). These
commenters also pointed out that several State logging standards specify minimum first-aid content requirements
(Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). In addition, one commenter also provided a list of minimum
contents needed for logging first-aid kits. Based on these comments and OSHA's expert judgment, the items listed
in Appendix A are the type necessary for dealing with injured persons in remote areas of varying climatic conditions.
OSHA points out that the specified contents are minimally adequate for a small logging crew of two to three employees.
Where crews are larger, additional kits or kits with more supplies may be needed. In formulating this final rule, OSHA
included Appendix A (First-aid supplies) and Appendix B (First-aid training) to provide the employer with a definitive
means of determining the adequacy of the first-aid kits and the training that employees must receive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has deleted from the final paragraph the proposed requirement that first-aid kits include snake bite kits. OSHA
received several comments about this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;67). One commenter said this requirement should be deleted since there were no poisonous
snakes in his area (Ex. 5&hyph;7). Other commenters said that some snake bite kits were not effective in treating bites
or that they are outmoded and can do more damage than good (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;67). For example, NIOSH said that it is possible more serious injury will occur to a
person by improper use of a snake bite kit (Ex. 5&hyph;42). According to the Regional Snake Bite Control Center at the
University Medical Center in Cincinnati, OH, snake bite kits should not be used when medical treatment is available
within one hour of the bite (Ex. 5&hyph;42). OSHA has determined that, given the regional differences in the logging
industry, employers should be allowed to work with their health care provider to determine whether a snake bite kit
is necessary and what kind of kit would be of most assistance for loggers working in that area. One of the factors the
health care provider should consider is how far particular loggers are from medical facilities and trained medical
personnel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) requires a health care provider to review and approve annually the first-aid kits the employer
provides, both as to the adequacy of the kit's contents and the number of kits provided. OSHA has added this requirement
in the final rule for several reasons. First, 1910.151(b) already requires that first-aid kits be approved by consulting
physicians. OSHA is aware that health care providers in addition to physicians are qualified to approve first-aid
kits and OSHA wants to provide flexibility for employers in meeting this requirement. Second, 1910.151(b) only requires
initial approval of first-aid kits rather than periodic approval. However, OSHA believes that a periodic review
of first-aid kits is necessary and appropriate in the logging industry. This industry is one in which the workplace
is often not near medical personnel, infirmaries, clinics, or hospitals that are best able to treat logging injuries.
Therefore, it is important for a health care provider to assess the contents of first-aid kits to see that they contain
those supplies that will provide effective assistance for an injured worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the kits are reviewed and approved, paragraph (d)(2)(iv) requires the employer to maintain the first-aid kits
in accordance with the approval conditions. Employers have the duty to ensure that first-aid kits are adequately
supplied and replenished as necessary. In addition, the employer is responsible for assuring that kit contents are
usable, that is, there is no spoilage or damage due to weather conditions. For example, employers need to periodically
check first-aid supplies to ensure that materials are still in clean and sterile condition.

Seat Belts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(3) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring the provision of seat belts for the operator of any vehicle
or any machine equipped with ROPS or FOPS and the use of seat belts by the vehicle and machine operator and passengers.
The pulpwood logging standard required the provision of seat belts on mobile equipment, but did not require the use
of seat belts by operators and passengers. The proposed rule required both the provision and use of seat belts by tractor,
equipment and personnel transport operators. In addition, the proposed rule allowed an exception to using seat belts
when the employer had ``reasonable cause to believe that safety of the operator is jeopardized by wearing a seat belt.''
The 1978 ANSI logging standard required logging machines to be equipped with seat belts. All State logging standards
also require the use of seat belts by operators and passengers of machines and vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on the use of seat belts (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39,
5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54, Tr. W1 79, 113, 183, 213). The West Virginia Forestry Association recommended
expanding the seat belt requirement to require seat belts be installed and used in all personnel transport vehicles
because West Virginia did not have a state seat belt law (Ex. 5&hyph;4). Other commenters also recommended that OSHA
not permit any exceptions to the use of seat belts (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;27, Tr. W1 183, 213). One commenter
reasoned that any exception would invite widespread abuse and seriously weaken OSHA's field enforcement capability
(Ex. 5&hyph;22). However, other commenters said that seat belts should not be required because they would unduly
restrict operators, would result in greater injury if an object entered the operator area (i.e., ``jillpoke''),
and would be hazardous for employees operating machines on steep terrain (Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;45; Tr. W1 79, 113,
OR 31&hyph;2, 83, 120, 181). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments in the record and the available accident data, OSHA has decided in the final rule to eliminate
the seat belt exception for several reasons. First, the record shows that use of seat belts would save lives in the logging
industry (Ex. 4&hyph;129). A State of Washington study also reported 12 loggers killed in rollover accidents from
1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). All 12 of those employees were crushed by the machine when they were thrown from the
cab. This study concluded that all of those deaths might have been prevented if the employees involved had been wearing
seat belts because the ROPS and FOPS were still intact when the machine came to a rest. This study also concluded that
eliminating exemptions on seat belt use would save lives in the logging industry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the record does not support the view that the operator's risk of being injured by a jillpoke entering the cab
is greater than the risk of injury from not wearing seat belts. Of the 105 logging fatalities reported to OSHA between
1985 and 1990, only one was caused by a jillpoke (Ex. 4&hyph;65). On the other hand, 7 fatalities occurred during machine
rollover accidents when either the machine operator or a rider was thrown from the machine and crushed because he was
not wearing a seat belt. NIOSH said that 80 deaths occurred due to logging machine rollovers from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex.
5&hyph;42). The State of Washington study indicated that 12 loggers were killed in machine rollover accidents and
no machine operators were killed during that period because of jillpokes (Ex. 4&hyph;129). California OSHA also
testified that their experience has been that the jillpoke hazard is far outweighed by the hazard of rollovers (Ex.
9&hyph;12). They provided examples of logging accidents in which the employee would not have died or been injured
if he had been wearing a seat belt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA has dealt directly with the hazard of jillpokes in the final rule. The final rule requires that all operator
cabs be equipped with screening or other material that will prevent objects from penetrating the cab. This requirement
is expected to prevent jillpoke injuries, therefore the seat belt exception is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, OSHA agrees with commenters that there should be no exception to the seat belt requirement for mobile machine
operators, especially those who operate on steep terrain. Mobile logging machines are operated on unlevel ground
and steep terrain where it is well-recognized that machine rollover and tipover is a primary danger. Seat belts will
restrain the operator in the cab and its protective structure rather than allowing the operator to try to jump free.
In most instances, when the operator tries to jump free he is pinned, crushed or hit by the machine, ROPS/FOPS or overhead
guard. Finally, OSHA notes that seat belts have been designed that keep operators restrained within the cab in the
event of a rollover or tipover, while at the same time providing them with maximum movement within the cab. One commenter
said these seat belts, which resemble carnival harnesses, have been designed by the Forest Engineering Research
Institute of Canada (Ex. 32). These seat belts would meet the requirements of this section while addressing the concerns
raised by the commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of the final rule requires that each employee fasten the seat belt securely and tightly so that
the employee is restrained in the vehicle or machine cab in the event of an accident. Evidence in this record (Ex. 5&hyph;35;
Tr. W2 190) indicates that employees frequently keep their seat belts loose in order to move in the cab more easily.
However, if the machine rolls over, the loose seat belt may not be effective in keeping the operator in the cab. In such
cases, the operator may be thrown from the cab and pinned or crushed by the machine because the seat belt was too loose
to keep the operator fully contained in the cab. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of the final rule requires that machine seat belts meet the requirements of the Society of Automotive
Engineers standard (SAE J386 June 1985) for seat belts for construction machines. This incorporation by reference
of SAE J386 June 1985, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements
of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite
information regarding access to the text of SAE J386, June 1985. This provision updates the proposed standard to incorporate
the latest SAE seat belt standard. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(v) of the final rule requires employers to assure that seat belts are not removed from any vehicle
or machine. This paragraph also requires the employer to replace the missing seat belts if seat belts were installed
in the vehicle or machine at the time of manufacture and have subsequently been removed. OSHA is aware that seat belts
are removed from machines because operators do not like to wear them. OSHA is requiring the replacement of seat belts
because the Agency believes they are essential in protecting machine and vehicle operators from being killed or seriously
injured in accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of the final standard requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers to assure that seat belts are maintained in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serviceable condition. Employers have the duty to ensure that seat belts are functioning properly and are not damaged.
The standard also requires inspection of seat belts as part of the general machine and vehicle inspection required
at the start of each workshift. (See discussion of maintenance in paragraphs (f) and (g)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(4) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring employers to provide and maintain a portable fire extinguisher
on each machine and vehicle. The extinguisher must meet the requirements of subpart L of part 1910. The pulpwood logging
and proposed standards required a fire extinguisher at locations where machines and vehicles are being operated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters urged OSHA to limit this requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39). Two of these commenters
said that fire extinguishers should only be required on heavy equipment and at refueling stations (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36). The other commenter said fire extinguishers should only be required during forest fire seasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has decided in the final rule to require extinguishers on each machine and vehicle for several reasons. First,
repeatedly in this rulemaking commenters have requested that OSHA more clearly define what constitutes a ``work
site,'' an ``operating area,'' or a ``work area.'' OSHA's intention in the proposed rule was that a fire extinguisher
be located where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
machine and vehicle is operated, including areas where they are refueled. OSHA believes that requiring the fire extinguisher
be located on each machine most clearly conveys the Agency's intention that the fire extinguisher move with the machine
or vehicle as it is operated and refueled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the potential for fire is a major concern in this industry (Ex. 5&hyph;20). It is important that extinguishers
be immediately available so that a fire can be extinguished before it goes out of control and endangers employees and
the forest. A fire extinguisher that is located at a landing where the machine begins its operation, may be of no use
when the machine is miles away from the landing picking up a load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, one of the areas where the potential for fire is great is during refueling of the machine. However, the proposed
standard only required the extinguisher to be located where machines and vehicles were being operated and did not
address refueling directly. If the extinguisher remains with the machine or vehicle, it will be there to protect against
fire hazards during refueling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, OSHA is aware that in many industrial settings, the extinguisher is already mounted on the machine or vehicle
so that it is immediately accessible when a fire occurs. Therefore, OSHA does not believe complying with this requirement
will pose a significant burden on the employer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(5) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that all work be stopped and that each employee move to a place
of safety when environmental conditions may endanger an employee in the performance of their job. This provision
also specifies that hazardous environmental conditions include, but are not limited to, electrical storms, high
winds, heavy rain or snow, extreme cold, dense fog, fires, mudslides, and darkness. The pulpwood logging and proposed
rules contained a similar provision, however, it only specifically identified electrical storms and high winds.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement and, in addition, required logging operations
to cease when visibility is inadequate, unless artificial lighting is provided. All State logging standards, except
the State of Alaska, have provisions requiring work to cease when environmental conditions are hazardous to employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received several comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;66; Tr. W1 139).
Some of these commenters recommended expanding the conditions listed in this provision. These commenters also said
logging should be stopped when darkness impairs visual ability, unless artificial light is provided. One commenter
said they do not allow their employees to work in blowing snow, extreme cold or winds (Ex. 5&hyph;51). Another commenter
said OSHA should specify that the work stoppage requirement should be limited to only that work that is affected by
the environmental conditions (Ex. 5&hyph;55; Tr. W1 139). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not believe it is possible to delineate each and every environmental condition that would necessitate termination
of work and moving employees to a place of safety. OSHA is aware that the employer's judgment will be essential in carrying
out this provision in the various environmental conditions that affect different regions of this industry. However,
the criteria that must form the basis of the employer's assessment is uniform_when a reasonable employer would believe
that environmental conditions may endanger employees performing a specific job or operating a specific piece of
equipment, work must stop and the employees must move to a place of safety. For example, darkness may prevent a feller
from accurately assessing the distance between occupied work areas or the condition of the tree to be cut (e.g., loose
bark, damaged trunk or limbs). If the feller is not able to properly assess these conditions, he may endanger himself
and others in the area. Therefore, work would have to stop unless artificial light were available to alleviate the
danger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another element of the determination as to whether an environmental condition may endanger an employee is the particular
job being performed and the tools of that job. For example, dense fog may endanger a feller because they may not be able
to see the top of the tree and accurately judge its lean. If such conditions exist, felling must be stopped. However,
fog may not necessarily endanger employees who are loading transport vehicles at a landing. In that case, the employees
might still be able to perform their job under such conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(6) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be so organized and spaced that the actions
of one employee will not create a hazard for any other employee. This paragraph also requires that each employee work
in a position or location that is within visual or audible contact with another employee. These provisions were adopted
from the proposed standard. The pulpwood logging and 1978 ANSI logging standards also recommended a two tree-length
distance between work areas. Requirements similar to the final rule exist in various State logging standards (Ex.
2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be assigned so that trees cannot fall into
adjacent occupied work areas. This provision also requires that the distance between adjacent occupied work areas
be at least two tree lengths of the trees being felled. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard contained
similar requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received comments supporting this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;41, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70; Tr. W2 163).
These commenters said that two tree lengths is already used in the industry to ensure safe spacing of work areas. Some
commenters, however, said that the provision should be limited (Ex. 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;44,
5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). One commenter said OSHA should require
minimum spacing requirements only when physical control of the timber was unpredictable, such as felling and skidding
(Ex. 5&hyph;28). Other commenters recommended that the requirement be limited to slopes that are greater than 25
or 35 percent (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of these requirements is to protect employees in adjacent occupied work areas from being hit by misdirected
trees. One of the major causes of injury in the logging industry is being hit by a tree. According to the WIR survey, almost
one-quarter of all those injured were hit by a tree (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State of Washington study showed that more than
65 percent of all employees were killed when they were hit by a tree or log (Ex. 4&hyph;129). In addition, the study showed
that almost nine percent of that reported fatalities resulted from an employee being hit by a tree being felled by another
employee (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees can be hit by a tree that falls in the wrong direction or by one that rolls or slides down sloping terrain. There
is no dispute that there is increased difficulty in directional felling on unlevel terrain. OSHA believes that these
work spacing requirements in the final rule will help to prevent these types of accidents. Moreover, adopting any
of the limitations that the commenters proposed would still leave employees exposed to other foreseeable hazards.
Since the two tree-length distance has become accepted practice in the industry, it appears that industry itself
recognizes the need for a minimum work spacing requirement and that the provision should not prove overly burdensome
for any establishments in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule OSHA is also requiring that employers assess conditions to determine whether
additional spacing between adjacent occupied work areas is necessary. Some of the conditions that employers must
examine include the degree of slope, the density of the growth, the height of trees, the soil structure, and other hazards
reasonably anticipated at that work site. This paragraph also requires that additional distance be maintained between
adjacent occupied work areas on any slope where rolling or sliding of logs is reasonably foreseeable. These provisions
were also contained in the proposed rule and in various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19,
2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters said greater distance should only be required when the slope is greater than 25 or 35 percent (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63). These commenters, however, did not provide any information on why such a limitation
would provide adequate protection for employees. OSHA does not agree that greater distance may only be necessary
on such steep slopes. OSHA believes there is a potential for trees and logs to roll and slide on lesser slopes when conditions
such as snow and ice accumulation or wet soil are present. Therefore, OSHA does not believe that adequate protection
would be provided if the commenters' recommendation were adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters said that a greater distance on slopes should not be required when employees are working to the side
of each other, pointing out that the Alaska logging standard allows this (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). OSHA
believes that the final standard is consistent with the Alaska logging standard. The final rule only requires that
a greater distance is required on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable. Nothing
in the final rule requires a greater distance on slopes when there is no danger that an employee could be hit by a rolling
or sliding log. For example, when employees work side by side on a slope, rather than uphill and downhill from each other,
there is no danger that the employee will be injured by a rolling log. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(6)(iii), OSHA is requiring that each employee, without exception, be located within visual or audible
contact of another worker. This provision must be read in conjunction with the requirements in paragraph (d)(7) specifying
what methods of audible contact may be used (i.e., not chain-saw engine noise). This requirement parallels the proposed
standard, however the proposed rule did not apply this requirement to motor vehicle operators, watchmen and other
single employee assignment jobs. The pulpwood logging standard required that employees work within the vocal range
of other loggers but also allowed employers to use an alternative procedure that provided for periodic checks of employee
welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the comment on this requirement has already been discussed in the Major Issues section above. Some commenters
opposed various aspects of this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54,
5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 65). One commenter recommended allowing manual fellers
to be out of contact with other employees, such as skidder operators, for up to 20 minutes (Ex. 5&hyph;54). This commenter
said that was the amount of time necessary to transport a load to the landing and return to the cutting area. However,
the commenter has not provided any information or data to support why such an exception would still allow for adequate
protection for fellers. OSHA does not believe that permitting periods of time in which contact is not maintained will
provide adequate protection for employees. A chain-saw operator who severely cuts himself could bleed to death within
20 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters opposed this provision because it would be difficult to comply with this requirement and maintain
the required two tree-length separation between adjacent work areas (Ex. 5&hyph;29, Tr. W1 pg 65). For several reasons,
OSHA believes employers will be able to comply with both requirements. First, this paragraph requires each employee
to be within visual or audible contact with ``another'' employee. It does not require that the person with whom contact
is maintained be in an adjacent work area. Second, the provision requiring at least two tree-length spacing between
adjacent occupied work areas is intended to prevent trees from falling from one work area into another. The purposes
of a visual or audible contact is to provide a method for employees to remain in contact in case of an emergency (e.g.,
a chain-saw operator requesting first aid after being cut by the saw, an employee alerting others of severe weather
approaching). Therefore, if employees are provided with radio communication, it would be possible for employees
whose work areas are spaced far apart to maintain contact with each other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, as discussed above in the issues section, the final rule does not require that visual contact be maintained.
Instead, audible contact may be maintained by the use of horns, whistles or radio communication. As such, employees
can be great distances from each other and still remain in contact satisfying the requirements of this provision.
Fourth, OSHA is also aware that many logging establishments are currently using radio communication to maintain
contact, that is the best evidence of its effectiveness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, in this paragraph OSHA has eliminated all proposed exceptions to the requirement of maintaining
contact with another employee. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA has eliminated the proposed exceptions
for several reasons. First, various State standards do not include an exception to the contact requirement (Ex. 2&hyph;17,
2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). Second, several commenters supported the proposal
that all employees remain in contact and indicated that they do maintain contact with all employees, including employees
in single employee assignments, via radio and telephone (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). As a result, these commenters
suggested the exceptions may no longer be necessary (See also, Ex. 5&hyph;33). These commenters also reasoned that
all employees, including mobile machine operators performing single employee assignments, need a method of summoning
help in an emergency. OSHA agrees with these commenters. The Agency believes that the contact requirement will help
to provide prompt assistance to all employees who are injured or are otherwise in emergency situations. As discussed
above in the Major Issues section, with the advent of radio communication, it is feasible to maintain contact with
workers performing single employee assignments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that it is implied in this provision that not only will means for contact be provided, but also that contact
will be maintained with each employee. All but one State logging standard require check-in systems to assure that
contact is maintained (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 38J, 38K). In addition, several
commenters say they have initiated check-in systems to assure that employees working in remote locations are all
right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the employer to account for each employee at the end of
the workshift. OSHA has adopted this provision from the pulpwood logging and the proposed standards. The 1978 ANSI
logging standard also contained a similar requirement. Several State logging standards also require check-in systems
at the end of the workshift to ensure no employees are left in the woods (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20,
38K). Several commenters said that it was not necessary for small felling and bucking crews to be accounted for by anyone
other than the crew members (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;63). In response, OSHA points
out that nothing in the final rule would prevent the employer from allowing a crew supervisor, for example, to account
for the rest of the crew at the end of the workshift. In such cases, the employer is responsible for establishing and
enforcing a regular system whereby there is a check on each employee at the end of the workshift. The most important
thing is that no employee is unaccounted for at the close of the shift. As with the contact requirement, OSHA believes
that this provision will help to assure timely assistance to employees in emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, end of shift accounting offers several other benefits to the employer and employee. First, the employer
can remain appraised of the progress made on the job during the last workshift. Second, any hazardous conditions that
were not contemplated during pre-shift meetings with employees can be relayed to the employer for dissemination
to other employees. Third, unserviceable tools and machines can be reported to the employer so that replacements
can be obtained or repairs can made before the next workshift. Therefore, OSHA has retained this provision in the final
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said this provision would interfere with contracting situations when the logger is an independent
contractor (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;23, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63). However, they did not provide
any evidence as to how this provision might conflict with contracting agreements.

Signaling and Signal Equipment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this final rule, OSHA is requiring that hand or audible signals such as whistles, horns,
or radios, be utilized whenever noise, distance or other factors prevent clear understanding of normal voice communications
between employees. Paragraph (d)(7)(ii) prohibits the use of engine noise, such as from chains saws, as a means of
maintaining contact. These provisions supplement and support the requirement for the maintenance of audible or
visual contact contained in paragraph (d)(6)(iii). The proposed rule also contained a contact requirement. However,
it would not have prohibited the use of chain-saw noise as a means of signaling. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also
contained a requirement similar to the proposed rule. Several State logging standards also prohibit the use of chain-saw
noise as a signaling device (Ex. 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). The Washington State logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard requires fellers to carry whistles, which are to be used for no other purpose than to summon help (Ex. 2&hyph;22,
5&hyph;7).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA received many comments on this provision opposing the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device,
that have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. Other commenters supported the provision, focusing their
comments on allowing communication devices such as telephones and radios in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;70,
7&hyph;74; Tr. W2 197). One of these commenters supported the provision because the use of electronic communication,
such as citizen band radios, makes controlling trainees easier (Tr. W2 197). Another commenter supported the use
of whistles for signalling because they produce a very unusual sound in the woods that can be heard for a great distance
(Ex. 5&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, there are two principal safety-related needs for a signalling system in logging operations. The first
is for the maintenance of communication between employees working in adjacent occupied work areas, both to warn other
employees of potential hazardous situations and to summon help in an emergency. The second need for a signaling system
is to provide guidance to the operators of machines and vehicles, such as cranes and other material handling machines,
when work site conditions prevent operators from seeing and controlling the operation. For example, if a crane is
used to move a load from below an overhang such as a cliff, a signal person might be needed to observe the load and to signal
the crane operator when and how to move the load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of the final rule prohibits the use of engine
noise as a signaling device. This paragraph does permit other locally and regionally recognized signals to be used.
This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any
comments opposing the use of locally or regionally recognized signals, therefore, the Agency has retained this provision
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA has added a provision requiring that only designated persons give
signals except in an emergency. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement.
Several State standards also require that only designated persons give signals (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22,
38K). As defined in this standard, a designated person is one who has the necessary knowledge, training and experience
to perform specific job tasks. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included this provision in the final rule for several reasons. First, OSHA believes that the signaling system
should be included in the employer's training-program so that employees who are called upon to act as signal persons
will know how to signal appropriately. This is especially important when an employee performs signaling to assist
with the safe operation or movement of a machine or load. It is also important that employees know the appropriate signals
in the event that help must be summoned. The employee requiring help needs to know what means are to be used to communicate
the necessary information and how to use those means of communication properly. In addition, other employees must
be trained in what they should listen for so they can avoid potential hazards or provide assistance. Second, OSHA believes
that employees without the necessary training should not be permitted to act as a signal person for assisting with
the operation and movement of machines and loads. When the signal person has not been adequately trained, the risk
of harm to the signal person, the machine operator and other employees in the vicinity is great. Third, the use of trained
signal persons should reduce the potential for conflicting signals that could create a hazard.

Overhead Electric Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(8)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that logging operations near overhead electric lines
be done in accordance with the requirements of 1910.333(c)(3). The proposed rule repeated some of the requirements
of 1910.333(c)(3). The pulpwood logging standard did not contain any provision regarding overhead electric wires.
All State logging standards contain restrictions regarding felling near power lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received addressing minimum clearance from overhead lines (Ex. 5&hyph;34). This commenter suggested
that when the line voltage is unknown and other information indicates that the line is obviously high voltage, a minimum
clearance of 20 feet must be maintained from the line until the line voltage is established by the electrical system
operator. The separation distance recommended by the commenter would provide clearance that would only be warranted
by a 350 KV line. OSHA believes that maintenance of that great a separation distance is unnecessary in this rule. High
voltage lines of this order of magnitude are usually on tall transmission towers, therefore it is highly unlikely
any employee would come in contact with the line or have any means of getting near the line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that 1910.333(c)(3) adequately spells out the precautions and clearances that must be taken when working
near overhead lines. OSHA finds nothing indicating that logging is different from the rest of general industry, therefore,
the Agency does not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(8)(ii) OSHA is requiring the employer to immediately notify the power company when any felled tree
comes into contact with a power line. This provision also requires each employee to remain clear of the area until the
power company advises there are no electrical hazards. OSHA has adopted this provision from the proposed standard.
OSHA did not receive any comments on this provision.

Flammable and Combustible Liquids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(9) of the final rule, OSHA is including requirements for the safe handling and use of flammable and
combustible liquids. As was proposed, the final rule requires such liquids to be stored, handled, transported and
used in accordance with subpart H of Part 1910. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters opposed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;34). One commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After carrying a 40 pound saw, lunch, water, wedges and wrenches, the last thing the timber faller wants to add is more
weight. So when he goes to carry fuel and oil it's normally carried in labeled plastic containers, generally in sizes
not exceeding two quarts. To carry fuel in approved containers would do nothing more than add back injuries to the statistics
(Ex. 5&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response, OSHA points out that there are approved plastic storage containers available in small sizes, such as
two quart containers. Nothing in the final rule or subpart H of part 1910 prohibits employers from using small plastic
storage containers, provided they meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106. Further under 29 CFR 1910.106, the maximum
allowable size of approved plastic fuel container is one gallon. OSHA does not believe that carrying one gallon or
less of fuel in a plastic container will substantially increase back injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable and combustible liquids not be transported
in the driver's compartment or in any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. OSHA is aware that pick-up trucks
are often used to transport employees to a logging work site. Transportation of flammable and combustible liquids
in the passenger compartment of these vehicles exposes the driver and passenger to fire and explosion hazards and
is not a safe practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(9)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that each machine, vehicle and portable powered tool, such as chain saw, be shut off during refueling. OSHA
has added this requirement because it believes that when handling flammable and combustible liquids, it is essential
to eliminate sources of ignition. The requirement to shut off the engines of motor vehicles when they are refueled
is mandatory in most states and is clearly posted in service stations. Because OSHA believes that it is essential to
minimize the sources of ignition when refueling vehicles, the Agency has retained the requirement as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(9)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable or combustible liquids not be used to start
fires. The proposed rule contained a requirement that chain saw fuel not be used to start fires. While several commenters
supported this requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92), other commenters, including
the State of Washington, opposed the provision (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;66). They said that loggers would use whatever
material they have to start a fire rather than losing production time to return to a vehicle to obtain materials. In
addition, the State of Washington said they were not aware of any injuries occurring as a result of this practice.

OSHA has carefully considered these comments. OSHA understands that in cold weather employees must be able to warm
their hands and feet to prevent frostbite and to maintain proper grip of tools. However, OSHA believes that the use
of a flammable liquid, such as gasoline, to start a fire can quickly result in an uncontrolled fire that endangers the
loggers and others in the vicinity. Other commenters have told OSHA about the dangers of fires, especially during
the dry season (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39). In particular, when an area is cold and wet, gasoline will not
volatilize or burn rapidly. However, as the fire gains intensity, the gasoline will evaporate more rapidly, causing
the fire to suddenly flame up and can rapidly get out of control. Instead of using gasoline or a gasoline mixture, there
are products available that are not combustible to start fires, such as fire starters comprised of sawdust and wax.
These products are small, light weight and will not suddenly accelerate their combustion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has deleted from the final rule the proposed requirement that chain-saw fuel not be used as a solvent. Two commenters
said that chain-saw fuel is recommended by manufacturer's as a cleaning solvent for chain-saws (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;34).
For example, manufacturers' specifications indicate that chain-saw fuel is the most effective solvent for cleaning
chain-saw air filters. OSHA agrees with the commenters and has eliminated the prohibition from the final rule.

Explosives and Blasting Agents

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(10) of the final standard, OSHA is including requirements on the safe use of explosives and blasting
agents. Paragraph (d)(10)(i) of the final requires that explosives and blasting agents be stored, handled, transported
and used in accordance with the requirements of subpart H of this part. This provision has been adopted from the proposed
rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. All State logging standards contain requirements
on the use of explosives and blasting agents. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that only designated persons handle or use such materials. As discussed
above, a designated person is one who possesses the requisite training, knowledge and experience to perform the specific
duties. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also required that explosives only be handled by trained
and experienced personnel. All State logging standards also require that only trained employees handle explosives.
OSHA did not receive any comments on these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(10)(iii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that explosives and blasting agents not be transported
in the driver compartment or any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. The proposed rule did not contain
a similar requirement. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule for the same reason that it included a similar
provision regarding flammable and combustible liquids. OSHA believes that employees may be gravely endangered
by riding over rough terrain and trails in close proximity to explosives.

Paragraph (e) of this final rule contains requirements for the safe use of hand and portable powered tools, including
chain saws. For the most part, these requirements were derived from corresponding provisions in the pulpwood logging
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule OSHA has combined provisions regarding both hand tools and chain saws. This was done to provide uniformity
in how tools are addressed in the logging standard. In addition, OSHA has combined these provisions to reduce duplicative
provisions, such as those dealing with maintenance and inspection of tools.

of the final rule, OSHA is requiring employers to assure that each hand and portable powered tool is maintained in serviceable
condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the tool is provided by the employer or employee. This paragraph
adopts the proposed provision. All State logging standards contain similar requirements about the maintenance
of logging tools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received several comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;62,
5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;66). These commenters supported the need for tools to be properly maintained. One commenter said
that lack of proper maintenance of chain saws contributes to a number of accidents (Ex. 5&hyph;35). However, most
of the commenters stated that the maintenance of tools that are supplied by employees should be the employees' responsibility
(Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;66).

employee's own tools.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 We feel very strongly that there should be a recognition of one's individual responsibility in this area. A more general
statement might be appropriate in this item simply stating that ``tools shall be properly maintained so as to assure
safe operation and shall be used only for their intended purpose and design'' (Ex. 5&hyph;39).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not agree with these commenters. OSHA believes that the Agency's reasoning in including a maintenance provision
in the PPE section applies here as well (See summary and explanation of paragraph (d)(1)(i)). The requirement for
employers to assure that tools are maintained in a serviceable condition does not prohibit the employer from allowing
an employee to inspect, maintain and repair tools he provides. The employer's responsibilities for compliance with
standards and for safe working conditions that the OSH Act imposes, applies even if the employee provides the tools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph is meant to be viewed in conjunction with paragraph (e)(1)(ii), that requires inspection of tools
before they are used in each workshift. As discussed above, ``serviceable condition'' is the state or ability of a
tool to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(1)(ii), OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is inspected before initial use
during each work shift. This paragraph also specifies the minimum elements to be inspected, such as chain brakes,
handles, guards, and controls, to assure that the tools are functioning properly. In the proposed standard, OSHA
specified that hand tools be checked during use to ensure continued serviceability. The proposed rule also required
chain saws to be ``frequently'' inspected. The proposed rule also contained elements that must be included in hand
tool inspections. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required periodic inspection of tools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received comments on these provisions. Some commenters recommended that OSHA establish the frequency that
tools, such as chain saws, should be inspected (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53). One commenter
objected to inspection of chain saws:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for chain saws to be ``frequently inspected'' should be clarified further. How often is frequently and who
would be responsible for the inspections? (Ex. 5&hyph;39).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns. First, OSHA explicitly identifies
the required frequency for inspection of tools. Second, nothing in the final rule prohibits the employer from allowing
the tool user or operator to conduct the workshift inspection, provided that such inspection and the required content
of the inspection are accomplished in the manner and time frame specified by OSHA. Finally, the standard specifies
the minimum elements that must be covered by the inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is used only for
purposes for which it has been designed. OSHA has adopted the provision from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging
standard also contained this requirement. OSHA received only one comment on this provision that supported its inclusion
(Ex. 5&hyph;39).

At paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that when the head of any shock, impact-driven or driving
tool begins to chip, it shall be repaired or removed from service. The proposed rule would have required that tools
be repaired when ``any mushrooming'' occurs. A similar requirement was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard.

The State of Washington opposed the proposed provision, stating that the language was too restrictive (Ex. 5&hyph;34,
9&hyph;10). The State said that as soon as a plastic wedge if firmly struck there will be some small amount of mushrooming.
In the final rule, OSHA has clarified this provision by requiring that the tool be repaired or removed from service
when it begins to chip. OSHA believes that this language more accurately describes the hazard that arises over time
with these tools. Over time there is a tendency for the steel in these tools to become brittle and chip. When a tool has
reached that point, continued use of the tool can cause metal fragments to chip off the tool and fly into the air, thereby
endangering employees. The metal fragments could be small enough to strike the eye or large enough to cause a sizeable
laceration.

At paragraph (e)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the cutting edges of each tool be sharpened in accordance
with manufacturer's specifications whenever they become dull during a workshift. OSHA received little comment
on this provision. One commenter stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the sharpness of cutting tools, we have had some interpretive problem in California where fire suppression
agencies who have been requiring various tools to be razor sharp rather than sharp enough to do the task for which they
are intended. The result has been unnecessary cuts to employees who have inadvertently had incidental contact with
such tools. We would suggest that the word ``adequately'' be inserted between the words ``kept'' and ``sharp'' to
provide a more ``moderate'' meaning to this requirement. (Ex. 5&hyph;55).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for tools to be inspected and sharpened as necessary is well-recognized and has been a part of OSHA's and ANSI's
logging standards from the start. OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns.
OSHA has added to the final rule the requirement that tools be sharpened according to the manufacturer's specifications.
This addition has also been supported by other commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (e)(1) (vi) and (vii) OSHA is requiring that each tool be stored and transported so it is not damaged and
will not create a hazard for an employee. These provisions require that racks, boxes, holsters or other means shall
be provided and used for transporting tools. These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed and
pulpwood logging standards. The proposed rule specified that tools be secured during transport but did not require
that storage containers be provided. In addition, these provisions as proposed were included in the 1978 ANSI logging
standard. OSHA received only limited comments on these provisions. Two commenters stated that the storage provision
was unnecessary and, at most, should be limited to cutting tools (Ex. 3&hyph;53 and 5&hyph;55). The other commenter
said that the proposed transportation provision was not protective enough (Ex. 5&hyph;7). This commenter stated
that outside boxes or storage units should be utilized especially for crew vehicles, because tools can bounce around
when transported in such a vehicle, particularly when the vehicle is operated on off highway roads or trails, and could
injure employees who are riding with the tools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that provisions for proper tool storage and transportation are necessary to protect employees from
injuries. Such provisions have been in OSHA and ANSI standards for many years. In this regard, however, OSHA also believes
that it is not necessary to require that tools be stored outside of passenger areas during transport if there are appropriate
containers or other means to adequately secure the tools. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has clarified that employers
must provide and use some means, such as racks, boxes or holsters, of securing tools during transport.

At paragraph (e)(2) of this final rule, OSHA specifies various requirements for the proper use of chain saws in the
logging industry. OSHA believes these requirements are necessary to protect loggers from injury when using chain
saws. Several commenters also supported the proposed chain saw requirements as reasonable practices (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). As discussed earlier, the WIR survey indicates that chain saw accidents
accounted for 20 percent of the reported accidents (Ex. 2&hyph;1). According to a Maine BLS, from 1980&hyph;87 there
were an average of 362 disabling chain-saw injuries each year (Ex. 4&hyph;176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years there have been many improvements in chain saw safety due to the introduction of devices such as chain
brakes, bar tip guards, and reduced kickback bars and chains. Also, the availability of protective chaps and pads
of ballistic nylon or other lightweight protective materials have provided further protection for chain-saw operators.
OSHA believes that proper use of improved chain saws and personal protective equipment, and compliance with the work
practices will greatly improve the safety record of chain saw operations. OSHA also believes that proper training
in these requirements will result in better understanding of how these safety devices and work practices can work
to reduce chain-saw related injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(i), OSHA is requiring each chain saw placed into initial service after the effective date of this
section be equipped with a chain brake. In addition, this paragraph requires that chain saws meet all other requirements
of the ANSI standard B175.1&hyph;1991 ``Safety Requirements on Gasoline-Powered Chain Saws.'' This incorporation
by reference of ANSI B175.1&hyph;1991, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with
the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides
the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI B175.1&hyph;1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e)(2)(i) also requires that each chain saw placed into service before the effective date of this section
be equipped with a protective device that minimizes chain-saw kickback. Finally, this provision also requires that
chain-saw kickback devices not be removed or otherwise disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule did not require installation of chain brakes or other devices. The proposed rule did, however, require
that when such devices were present they should be inspected frequently and maintained. The need for devices to prevent
kickback was specifically raised as an issue in the notice of hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on whether chain-saw protective devices should be required in the final rule. These comments
have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. One commenter suggested that loggers be allowed to remove chain
brakes when, in the judgment of the operator the presence of the chain brake creates a hazard greater than the hazard
the brake was designed to avoid (Ex. 5&hyph;55). This commenter suggested that it is more hazardous to have a chain
brake when the saw is operated on its side and at other unspecified times. However, the commenter did not provide any
data or other evidence to support his contention. There is no other data or evidence in the record that chain brakes
may create additional hazards at any time during the cutting process. Additionally, OSHA believes that once the chain
brake is removed it is likely the operator will leave it off and remain exposed to injury from chain saw kickback. As
noted in the earlier discussion, commenters stated that removal of devices is occurring, thereby exposing the operator
to the risk of injury due to kickback. Therefore, OSHA is requiring that chain-saw kickback devices not be removed
or otherwise disabled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each gasoline-powered chain saw be equipped with
a continuous throttle system which stops the running chain when pressure on the throttle is released. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA received one comment that stated that if the safety equipment that came
with the chain saw were in place, the accidents listed in the preamble would not have occurred (Tr. W1 66). Therefore,
this requirement has been retained in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIOSH recommended that OSHA require chain saws be equipped or retrofitted with mufflers meeting the chain-saw manufacturer's
specifications (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH said mufflers would be effective for noise reduction. OSHA has not adopted
NIOSH's recommendation. First, retrofit mufflers may cause operational difficulties. Second, retrofit mufflers
may also contribute to an increase in back pressure for the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) through (e)(2)(xiv) specify various requirements for safe operation of chain saws. OSHA
believes these work practices are essential in reducing the number of injuries that occur to chain-saw operators.
According to the WIR survey, the vast majority of chain-saw injuries reported indicates that unsafe work practices
were involved (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In contrast, only four percent of chain-saw injuries were the result of equipment failure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be operated and adjusted in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA
did not receive any comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be refueled at least 20 feet from any
open flame or other source of ignition. This provision adopts the requirements contained in the proposed rule. This
requirement was also contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The OSHA pulpwood logging standard required only
that chain saw operators be instructed to refuel the saw only in safe areas and not in areas conducive to fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that a separation between a fueling area and any source of ignition, such as a cigarette, is necessary
to prevent ignition of vapors from spills or from overfilled chain-saw tanks. The final rule clarifies what constitutes
at least a minimal safe fueling area. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started at least 10 feet from any fueling
area. This provision also adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one commenter opposed this provision, saying that in some instances it would be impossible to move 10 feet from
a fueling area to start the chain saw (Ex. 5&hyph;7). However, no substantive evidence was presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that when a chain saw is started, there is a potential that spilled fuel in the area could also become ignited.
For example, a faulty spark plug wire can cause an arc between the wire and metal casing, resulting in the igniting of
spilled fuel. In addition, the record shows that the danger of fire is a major concern in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;20).
OSHA believes that this provision will help to reduce the potential for fires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started on the ground or where otherwise
firmly supported. The provision is the same as the requirement contained in the proposal and the pulpwood logging
standard. Two commenters opposed the requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;35). One commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In many instances, there is not any way to comply, i.e., when a cutter is felling while standing on springboard jacks,
it would be a greater hazard for him to climb up carrying a running saw. This means that the chain saw must be started on
the springboard with no place left to rest the saw. The same situation occurs when limbing and bucking large trees after
they are on the ground. The cutter/bucker would have to climb up on the trunk while carrying a running saw. The proposed
standard should be amended to read ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
whenever possible
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'' chain saws should be started [on the ground] (Ex. 5&hyph;34). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other commenter said starting the chain saw on the ground was not necessarily the safest way to start it, and, in
any event, saws equipped with chain brakes could be drop started when the chain brake is engaged (5&hyph;35). Another
commenter said that they had had no injuries resulting from starting chains saws when standing in an upright position
(Ex. 5&hyph;45). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several reasons, OSHA believes that this provision is necessary to protect chain saw operators. First, the record
supports the need for chain saws to be firmly supported when they are started. The WIR survey indicates that a significant
portion of chain saw injuries were related to the operator not having firm control or grip of the saw (e.g., didn't have
tight grip on saw, hand slipped into chain, operator fell on saw). While the survey does not indicate whether these
injuries occurred while the operator was starting the saw, the presence of these injuries does reinforce the need
for appropriate work practices that require proper support for equipment so the operator is able to maintain a firm
grip and control of the saw.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, OSHA believes that there is a potential for injury when operators attempt to drop-start chain saws. There
is a potential for the operator to lose his grip when starting the saw. In addition, especially when the saw is not properly
adjusted, the engine can flood. This can cause the saw to fly upward and hit the operator. When the chain saw starts there
is potential for sudden movement of the chain because of the increase in rpm. Third, while OSHA believes that starting
the chain saw on the ground will provide the best control and support, OSHA is aware that there may be some circumstances
in which a chain saw cannot be started in this manner. Nonetheless, even in those circumstances, OSHA believes that
it is necessary for operator safety that the saw be firmly supported. Fourth, even when the chain brake is on, the saw
needs to be firmly supported when it is started. When the chain saw is started, the chain will move until the engine returns
to idle. If the chain saw is not firmly supported when the operator starts the engine, he could lose control of the saw
and the moving chain could strike and injure him. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that chain brakes be engaged when the saw is started.
Although this requirement was not contained in the proposed rule, OSHA believes it is necessary for chain brakes to
be engaged when the engine is started. As discussed above, when chain saws are started, the chain will run momentarily.
When a chain brake is present, it will hold the chain when the engine returns to idle. However, when the chain brake is
not engaged, the chain may continue to run at idle, further exposing the operator to the hazard. OSHA believes that
the many comments recommending that the final rule require chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes, also imply
that the chain brakes should be properly engaged during use of the chain saw. In addition, none of those commenters
supporting a chain brake provision indicated that there were situations in which it would be safe to allow the chain
brake not to be engaged during operation of the saw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that the operator hold the chain saw with both hands
during operation. This requirement does not apply when the employer can demonstrate that a greater hazard is posed
by keeping both hands on the saw in that particular situation. This provision is the same as the provision contained
in the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also recognized the occasional need for momentary release of
one hand from the saw in some situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters urged OSHA to require that a chain saw must never be operated with only one hand (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;66). One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Regardless of what organization recognizes and sanctions momentary one-handed chain saw use, it is extremely dangerous.
I do not agree it is necessary to operate a saw with one hand and place a wedge with the other. By so doing, the right hand
is on the pistol grip controlling the throttle, the left handling the wedge. If, during this one-handed process a kick
back should occur, the left hand which has the primary responsibility for maintaining a distance between the operator
and the saw chain is absent. Sufficient time exists between the initiation of the backcut and its completion for the
cutter to momentarily halt his sawing to insert a wedge (Ex. 5&hyph;66). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Dept. of Interior also said that chains saws should be held with both hands unless the motor is at idle (Ex. 5&hyph;50).
It is not difficult for chain-saw operators to put the saw in idle before removing one hand from the saw. Before placing
a wedge the feller can stop the chain by simply removing his finger from the throttle, that will idle the chain saw, thereby
reducing the possibility of injury resulting from operating the saw with only one hand. OSHA agrees that in this situation
as well as most other operating situations, the greater hazard is posed by removing the hand from the chain saw. According
to the WIR survey, 13 percent of chain-saw operators injured reported that their hand slipped into the chain or they
did not have a tight grip on the saw. However, OSHA believes there are other situations in which the hazard may be greater
if the operator attempts to hold the saw with two hands. For example, when an operator has climbed a tree to top the tree,
the operator may not be able to keep his balance if he tries to operate the saw with both hands. In that case, the safest
method may be to use one hand to control the saw and the other hand to steady himself.

OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a greater hazard exists by keeping both hands on
the saw in a particular situation. OSHA also notes that the limited exception involves a case-by-case determination
by the employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(ix) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw operator be certain of his footing before
starting to cut. This provision also requires that the chain saw not be operated in a position or at a distance that could
cause the operator to become off-balance, to have insecure footing, or to relinquish a firm grip on the saw. This provision
adopts requirements contained in the proposed rule. Commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;55), and there were no comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes this work practice will help to reduce the number of slip and fall injuries occurring in the logging industry.
According to the WIR survey, slips and falls account for 24 percent of all injuries and 13 percent of all chain saw injuries
reported resulting from operators falling on the saw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(x) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that prior to felling a tree the chain saw operator clear
away brush or other potential obstacles that might interfere with cutting or using the retreat path. This provision
adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this requirement. OSHA believes
this provision will help to reduce the number of injuries that result from loggers being hit by trees. According to
the WIR survey, 24 percent of all injured loggers were hit by trees (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In addition, of employees reporting
injuries, over one-fourth said that heavy brush, ground cover and hidden wood on the ground had contributed to their
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(xi) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting cutting directly overhead with a chain saw. This provision
was contained in the proposed rule. Several commenters supported the proposed provision (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42,
9&hyph;10) and no comments were received opposing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(xii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be carried in a manner that will prevent
operator contact with the chain and muffler. The proposed rule contained the same requirement. Evidence in the record
suggests that this work practice already is being used extensively in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;66). Some
commenters said that for many years chain saw operators have carried the saw on their shoulder and used a felt and/or
leather pad to protect their neck and shoulder from being cut by the chain or burned by the hot engine (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;63). OSHA notes that any other method of carrying the chain saw that prevents these hazards would
also meet this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraphs (e)(2)(xiii) and (xiv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying requirements for carrying a chain saw.
In paragraph (e)(2)(xiii), OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be shut off or at idle before the operator starts a retreat
after cutting a tree. This provision also clarifies OSHA's intent that these work practices apply not only to carrying
the saw between cuts but also to retreating after a cut has been made. This provision has been adopted from the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH supported this provision, and further recommended that OSHA should require the chain brake to be engaged when
an operator is moving from one location to another, except while working on the same tree or log, regardless of distance
traveled (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Another commenter also supported the NIOSH recommendation (Ex. 5&hyph;52). However,
three other commenters opposed requiring saws to be at idle or shut off before starting a retreat (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;66). One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The cutter may lose precious seconds worrying about compliance with the proposed standard, meanwhile a life could
be in danger. Better to immediately remove the cutter from the base of the tree than worry about the saw (Ex. 5&hyph;50).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that the requirement that chain saws be shut off or at idle before starting a retreat is necessary and
can be accomplished without creating additional hazards for the operator. First, OSHA believes that carrying a chain
saw with the chain moving may present a great hazard for the operator. The WIR survey indicates that a significant portion
of chain saw injuries result from the operator falling on the saw, the saw chain contacting the employee, or the operator's
hand slipping into the chain (Ex. 2&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, as OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the saw can be at idle rather than shut off, provided
that the chain brake is engaged. OSHA is allowing operators to comply by either method because it recognizes that idling
the saw with the chain brake engaged is as effective as shutting off the engine in terms of preventing serious lacerations
due to coming into contact with the moving chain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA does not think that idling the saw will add a significant amount of time to the operator's retreat. All the
operator must do to idle the chain saw and safely carry it is to release pressure on the throttle and grasp the front handle.
Fourth, in any event, chain saws are designed to be carried by the front handle rather than by the rear throttle. Carrying
the saw by the front handle is easier and there is no risk of the bar tip contacting the operator's leg or toe. Carrying
the saw by the rear throttle guard can cause the bar tip to swing downward and possibly strike the operator. Therefore,
OSHA believes that the operator should grasp the front handle thereby idling the saw. That way the operator will both
protect himself from a falling tree and from saw lacerations without undue difficulty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e)(2)(xiv) of the final rule requires that when the operator must carry the chain saw further than 50 feet
that the chain brake be engaged or, if there is no chain brake, that the saw be shut off. This provision also requires
that the chain brake be engaged or the saw shut off when carrying a saw for a lesser distance if conditions, such as but
not limited to, the terrain, underbrush and slippery surfaces, may create a hazard for an employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI logging standard required that chain saws be shut
off when carried for a distance greater than from tree to tree. In addition the ANSI standard also required that when
the terrain and other physical factors, such as underbrush and slippery surfaces, make the carrying of a running saw
for such short distances, the saw shall be shut off for carrying. Some State logging standards also require the chain
saw to be shut off or at idle when moving from tree to tree (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;22). For example, the State of Washington
logging standard requires that after the chain-saw operator has felled the tree, the saw must be shut off or at idle
while moving to another tree (Ex. 2&hyph;22). This standard also requires the chain saw to be shut off when moving to
the next tree when hazardous conditions are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;66). One of these commenter said that
their experience had been that a chain-saw operator could carry a chain saw any distance without being injured, provided
the chain brake was engaged (Ex. 5&hyph;27). Another commenter supported the provision because carrying a running
chain saw any distance promotes additional fatigue that can also contribute to accidents and errors (Ex. 5&hyph;66).
The reasoning and explanation for shutting off chain saws before beginning retreat also applies to carrying chain
saws for longer distances. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all chain-saw operators were injured when they
fell on their saws (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce exposure to the hazard of a running
chain-saw chain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f) of this final rule, OSHA is promulgating requirements for stationary and mobile machines. These
provisions include requirements for machine operation, protective structures, overhead guards, machine access,
stability and reliability, exhaust systems and brakes. As previously defined, a machine is a piece of equipment having
a self-contained powerplant that is operated off-road and used for the movement of material.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes these machine requirements are necessary to protect operators and other employees who are in the area
where machines are being operated. According to the FRSI, 20 percent of all serious logging injuries involved machines
(Ex. 4&hyph;65). Of all serious injuries reported, almost eight percent of employees injured were struck by a logging
machine or vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record also shows that a significant number of logging employees are killed in machine accidents. The OSHA FCI
report indicates that 17 percent of all employees were killed in machine accidents. The State of Washington fatality
study in consistent with the FCI report. According to that study, almost 20 percent of the employee deaths resulted
from machine rollover or being struck by a machine (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the employer to assure that each machine used
by an employee is maintained and inspected so that the machine remains in serviceable condition. The employer must
assure that any machine is inspected before initial use during a workshift, and that defects or damage be repaired
or the unserviceable machine be replaced before work is commenced. Maintenance and inspection requirements were
also contained in the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the general maintenance and inspection requirement for each machine (Ex. 5&hyph;10,
5&hyph;16). For example, one commenter said that daily cleaning and inspection of machines was a necessary element
of fire prevention as well as other workplace protection (Ex. 5&hyph;10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation for the maintenance and inspection requirements for PPE and hand
and portable powered tools also applies to machines. (See discussion above of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), d(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i),
and (e)(1)(ii).) As with tools and PPE, OSHA is imposing on the employer the obligation of assuring that machines are
in serviceable condition. This obligation applies regardless of whether the employer or employee provides the machine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that because a general machine maintenance and inspection requirement has been included in the final rule,
the Agency has deleted from the final rule proposed maintenance and/or inspection requirements for any particular
machine safety feature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that operating and maintenance
instructions are available on the machine or in the area where the machine is being operated. This paragraph also requires
that each machine operator and maintenance employee comply with the instructions. The pulpwood logging standard
and the proposal both specified that instructions be kept with each machine. The proposed rule also contained a provision
requiring operators and maintenance personnel to comply with the instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the proposed provision, however, other commenters opposed requiring that instructions
be kept on machines. These comments have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Machine Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At (f)(2)(i) of this final rule, OSHA is requiring that machines be operated only by designated persons. As explained
above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform specific
duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included this provision in the final rule for two reasons. First, this provision must be read in conjunction
with the training requirements in the final rule. The training provisions require that each machine operator be trained
and demonstrate the ability to safely operate a machine before he/she is allowed to work independently. This provision
reinforces the requirement that the employer not allow untrained personnel to operate machines. Second, training
and skill are particularly necessary in an industry when machines are being operated in adverse weather conditions
and on steep or unlevel terrain. Employees who have not been trained to safely operate a logging machine under such
conditions could injure themselves or others. As noted earlier, over one-third of all employees reporting injuries
in the WIR survey had never received any kind of training (Ex. 2&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraphs (f)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying various requirements regarding stability
limitations for machines. Stability limitations of machines used in logging are determined by three factors: (1)
load size; (2) what is done with the load when it is being handled; and (3) the physical environment in which the machine
is being operated. These requirements address each of those factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (f)(2)(ii), OSHA is requiring that stationary logging machines and their components be anchored or
otherwise stabilized to prevent movement during operation. The proposed standard contained a provision requiring
that stability limitations of machines not be exceeded. The proposed standard also contained a provision specifying
that truck and crawler mounted rigid boom cranes and other yarders meet the stability requirements of the ANSI B30.2&hyph;1983
``Safety Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Overhead and Gantry Cranes'' or the ANSI B30.5&hyph;1982 ``Safety
Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Crawler, Locomotive and Truck Cranes.'' The pulpwood logging standard required
only that the operator be advised as to the stability limitations of the machine. Several commenters pointed out that
machines referenced in those standards were not used for logging operations (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;29,
5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;67). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule OSHA has deleted reference to the ANSI standards because those machines are covered elsewhere in
part 1910. Overhead cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.179 and mobile cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.180. OSHA believes
that these standards adequately spell out the requirements for safe operation when operating cranes. OSHA finds
nothing indicating that the use of cranes is different from the rest of general industry, therefore, the Agency does
not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry. In addition, most of the machines referenced
in the ANSI standards, overhead and gantry cranes, crawlers locomotive cranes and truck cranes; either are not used
or are infrequently used in logging operations covered by this standard. OSHA also has deleted the proposed provisions
on reliability and stability of cranes for the same reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the rated capacity of any machine not be exceeded.
As discussed above, OSHA has defined rated capacity as the maximum load a system, vehicle, machine or piece of equipment
was designed to handle. This provision was not explicitly contained in the proposed standard. Rather, it was implied
as part of the requirement that machine operators comply with the operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood
logging standard, however, did require that operators at least be advised about the load capacity of machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that it is necessary to explicitly state this requirement in the final standard. When the rated capacity
of the machine is exceeded, rollover and tipover accidents occur. As discussed above, many logging injuries and deaths
are the result of machine rollover accidents. The State of Washington study showed that nine percent of the reported
logging fatalities resulted from machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;129). The OSHA FCI report also showed that
10 percent of fatalities were due to machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The Agency believes that it is not
sufficient to merely inform operators of the machine's capacity, rather operators must be instructed that load capacities
shall not be exceeded. As part of the training of machine operators, the operator also needs to be instructed on how
to keep the load within the rated capacity and what foreseeable conditions or actions can affect the machine's rated
capacity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that no machine be operated on any slope that is greater
than the maximum slope recommended by the manufacturer. In the proposed standard, this requirement was implied in
the provision that operators comply with operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood logging standard had specified
that operators be advised of the stability limitations of the machine. As with the requirement on rated capacity,
OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce the potential for machine rollover and tipover accidents. Therefore,
the Agency has explicitly stated this requirement in the final standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the operator to determine that no employee is in the path
of the machine before starting or moving the machine. This provision parallels the proposed rule. In the pulpwood
logging standard, the operator was required to walk completely around the machine before start up to ensure no employee
was in the area. There were no comments on the proposed requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce
the number of accidents when employees are struck by machines. According to the State of Washington study, 10 percent
of all logging fatalities occurred when employees were struck by machines (Ex. 4&hyph;129). The OSHA FCI report indicated
similar results. Eight percent of the employees killed were struck by a logging machine (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Therefore,
this requirement has been retained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be started and operated only from the
operator's station or as otherwise recommended by the manufacturer. This requirement adopts the provision contained
in the proposed rule. Again, there were no comments opposing this provision. Under normal conditions, the only safe
place for an operator to be during the use of a machine is at the operator's station. However, some types of material
handling equipment have more than one operator's station. In those situations, the operator may choose which available
operator's station to use when operating the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be operated at such a distance from other
employees and machines that a hazard is not created for any employee. This requirement parallels provisions contained
in both the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comment on the proposed requirement.
The reasoning and explanation for checking the area before starting or moving a machine applies to this provision
as well. The record shows that many employees are injured and killed when they are hit by logging machines (Ex. 2&hyph;1,
4&hyph;61, 4&hyph;129). Therefore, OSHA has adopted the provision as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraphs (f)(2)(viii) and (ix) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting riders on machines and loads. At paragraph
(f)(2)(viii), OSHA is specifying that no employee, other than the operator, be allowed to ride on the machine unless
seating, seat belts and other protection equivalent to that provided for the operator is available for the rider.
There were no comments opposing this provision. In paragraph (f)(2)(ix), OSHA is prohibiting riding on any load.
These requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. Several comments were received on these
provisions and have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(2)(x) of the final rule requires that before any machine is shut down, the machine brake locks or parking
brakes shall be applied. This provision also requires that each moving element, such as but not limited to, blades,
buckets and shears, shall be grounded. As defined in the final rule, grounded means the placement of a component of
a machine on the ground or on a device where it is firmly supported. This requirement was also contained in the pulpwood
logging and the 1978 ANSI logging standards. The proposed rule would have required that the moving elements of any
machine be lowered to the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said employers should be viewed in compliance with this provision if the moving element is placed
in on a device on the equipment designed to hold moving elements in a stationary, secure position (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). This is the method used to ground moving elements on certain machines, such as knuckleboom loaders. OSHA
agrees with these commenters that it may be appropriate for the moving elements of a machine to be grounded if the moving
elements can be placed on a device that can hold it in a stationary and secure position. However, in those situations
when the machine does not have a device to place the moving element, the moving element must be lowered to the ground.
OSHA believes this provision is necessary because the record shows that logging employees are injured and killed
when they are crushed between equipment and equipment parts or struck by falling and swinging equipment components
(Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(2)(xi) of the final rule requires that after each machine is shut down, pressure or stored energy from
hydraulic and pneumatic storage devices shall be discharged. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because
if pressure or stored energy is not discharged water will accumulate in the storage device thereby decreasing the
amount of fluid to carry out the function of the system. For example, many machines use air brake systems. If the compressed
air reservoir fills up with water and displaces the air, there may not be enough air to stop the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (f)(2)(xii) and (xiii) of this final rule, OSHA is adopting provisions for transporting machines.
Paragraph (f)(2)(xii) requires that the rated capacity of any vehicle transporting a machine not be exceeded. Paragraph
(f)(2)(xiii) requires that the machine be loaded, secured and unloaded so that it will not create a hazard for any employee.
These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing
these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation on machine rated capacity (paragraph (f)(2)(iii)) applies as well
to transporting machines on trailers. Machines, as defined in this standard, are material handling equipment that
are not operated on the public highways. Therefore, they must be transported on trailers across public roads from
work site to work site. The loading and unloading of a machine on a trailer can be a hazardous event. The principal hazards
occur due to rollover of the machine as it is driven up or down the trailer ramp or the ramp failing under the weight of
the machine. Rollover can occur when a machine is not properly aligned when being driven onto or off a trailer or when
the machine operator unsuccessfully attempts to make minor corrections in the direction of travel of the machine
on the ramp. The latter case is particularly likely when the machine runs on tracks rather than wheels, and directional
corrections are much more difficult to achieve. OSHA believes these machine transport provisions are necessary
to prevent injury to machine operators and other employees in the area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f)(3)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the specified logging machines that are placed into
initial service after the effective date of the final standard be equipped with falling object protective structures
(FOPS) and/or rollover protective structures (ROPS). This provision applies to each tractor, skidder, swing yarder,
log stacker, and mechanical felling device, such as a tree shear or feller-buncher. This provision combines the FOPS
and ROPS requirements contained in the proposed standard. ROPS requirements are also contained in several State
logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). In addition,
FOPS and ROPS requirements are contained in OSHA Construction Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1926, and Agriculture
Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1928. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments supporting the FOPS and ROPS requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;19,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92) and did not receive any comments
opposing this provision in general. Many of the commenters addressed the issues of retrofitting machines with ROPS
and FOPS and incorporation by reference of SAE standards have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that the ROPS requirement should also apply to loaders on self-loading logging trucks (Ex. 5&hyph;7).
However, three other commenters said this machine should be excluded from the requirement because the machine would
not meet most state highway height restrictions if FOPS and/or ROPS were added to the operator station (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;49). OSHA agrees with these three commenters and has not expanded the FOPS and ROPS requirements
to cover loaders on self-loading logging trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The necessity of ROPS and FOPS on logging machines is not disputed. Steep terrain, slippery or uneven ground, large
loads, top-heavy equipment with loads, and other environmental conditions and unsafe work practices increase the
potential for logging machine rollover. ROPS reduce the likelihood that operators will be crushed in the event their
machine rolls over. FOPS prevent falling objects such as trees, limbs and winch lines from penetrating the cab and
injuring the operator. As OSHA noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, ROPS and FOPS are standard features on all
currently manufactured logging machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on other comments in the record, OSHA has made the following changes to the ROPS and FOPS provision in the final
rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The ROPS and FOPS requirements have been incorporated in one provision because the SAE FOPS standard (J231, January
1981) specifies that only machines equipped with ROPS can also be equipped with FOPS. The ROPS-FOPS requirement of
the SAE standard was pointed out by three commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Machines only used in construction activities, such as road building, rather than logging operations have been
deleted from this provision (e.g., graders, scrapers, bulldozers, front-end loaders). Construction machines
and activities continue to be covered under 29 CFR Part 1926. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Forklift trucks have been deleted from this provision and included in a separate provision in the final standard
(see paragraph (f)(4)). One commenter pointed out that forklift trucks were manufactured with overhead guards rather
than ROPS and FOPS and, therefore, were not included in the SAE standards (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;47; Tr. W1 224)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. An exception to the ROPS and FOPS requirement has been added for machines capable of 360-degree rotation. Two commenters
pointed out that the mast assembly of these machines, usually converted excavators, protects against machine rollover
(Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;40, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;63). In addition,
the boom structure provides crush protection during rollover or tipover (Ex. 5&hyph;16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (f)(3) (ii) and (iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that ROPS and FOPS be tested, installed and
maintained in accordance with the following Society of Automotive Engineers standards: ``Performance Criteria
for Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining Machines'' SAE
J1040, April 1988; ``Minimum Performance Criteria for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS)'' SAE J231,
Jan 1981; and ``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory Evaluation'' SAE J397, April 1988. This incorporation
by reference of SAE J1040; April 1988, SAE J231, Jan 1981, and SAE J397; April 1988, have been approved by the Office
of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has
been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of SAE J1040,
April 1988, SAE J231, 1981, and SAE J397, April 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions update the requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA received various comments on incorporating
consensus standards by reference, and this issue has been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (f)(3)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the protective structure on each machine be of a size
that does not impede the operator's normal movements in the cab. This provision parallels the provision contained
in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraphs (f)(3)(vi) through (xii) specify requirements for enclosing the operator's cab. OSHA did not receive
any comments opposing these provisions in general. One commenter did recommend that OSHA replace these provisions
with a reference to the Society of Automotive Engineers J1084, April 1980, standard on force requirements for tractors
and skidders (Ex. 5&hyph;16). However, since the SAE standard does not cover all of the machines referenced in paragraph
(f)(3), OSHA has specified in the final rule the cab force requirements which are applicable to machines used in logging
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(vi) of the final rule requires that the overhead covering of each cab be of solid material extending
over the entire canopy. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(vii) requires that the lower portion of the cab (up to the top of the instrument panel or 24 inches
(60.9 cm) if there is no instrument panel) be completely enclosed, except at entrances, with solid material to prevent
objects from entering the cab. The proposed rule stated generally that the lower portion of the cab be fully enclosed.
One commenter said that what constitutes the ``lower portion'' of the cab should be specifically defined (Ex. 5&hyph;16).
OSHA has incorporated the commenter's recommendation that the lower portion be defined as below the top of the instrument
panel or at 24 inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule requires that the upper portion of the cab be fully enclosed. The enclosure
must be made of mesh material with openings no greater than 2 inches (5.08 cm) at its least dimension or other material
that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection and visibility. This provision combines two requirements
contained in the proposed rule: full enclosure of the upper rear portion of the cab and enclosure extending forward
as far as possible from the rear corners of the cab sides. The proposed rule also required that the mesh material openings
be no greater than 13/4 inches. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required metal mesh when glass alone is not sufficient
to provide operator protection. In the final rule, OSHA has combined these provisions because one commenter said
that ``upper rear portion'' and ``as far as possible'' were not adequately defined (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In addition,
OSHA has changed the final rule to allow mesh material with openings no greater than two inches, that one commenter
pointed out is the accepted standard in the western States (See Ex. 2&hyph;22, 5&hyph;71, 38K).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters said that OSHA should limit the types of vehicles requiring mesh material (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). They said mesh should not be required on front-end loaders, log stackers, forklifts, scrapers and graders.
They contend some of these machines are used in log stacking areas where there is no danger of branches entering the
cab. In the final rule, OSHA has deleted front-end loaders, trucks, graders, and scrapers from paragraph (f)(3) because
they are used in performing construction activities rather than logging operations. With regard to log-stackers,
OSHA believes it is necessary for these machines to be equipped with mesh material or equivalent protection. Log-stackers
are used to raise and move trees as well as logs. In some cases trees are not topped until they are taken to the landing.
When trees still contain branches, they could enter the cab and injure the operator if no cab protection is provided.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule also specifies that the cab may be enclosed with a material other than mesh,
provided the employer demonstrate that it provides equivalent protection and visibility. The proposed rule implied
that transparent material could be used but did not specify what level of protection it must provide. The 1978 ANSI
logging standard specified that when glass enclosures were used, they must be safety glass or its equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. One commenter stated that many machines are already enclosed
with other material, such as safety glass, that offers equivalent protection and visibility (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In
addition, the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J1084, April 1980, ``Operator Protective Structure Performance
Criteria for Certain Forestry Equipment, Recommended Practice'' allows cabs to be enclosed with safety glass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that when transparent material, other than safety
glass is used, that it provides both equivalent protection and visibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of the final rule requires that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility. The proposed
rule required that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility to the rear. OSHA believes that it is necessary
that the enclosure allow maximum visibility in all directions so that the operator and other employees in the area
are not injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(x) of the final rule requires that if transparent material, rather than mesh, is used to enclose
the upper cab, it shall be of safety glass or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection
and visibility. This provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule. The proposed standard also
specified that a metal screen must also be used where transparent material alone does not provide adequate protection.
In the final rule, OSHA specifies the preferred transparent material (i.e. safety glass). OSHA agrees with various
commenters that when safety glass is used, additional metal mesh screens are not necessary. The final rule does allow
alternative material to be used, and makes clear OSHA's intent that it is the employer who bears the burden of proving
that the alternative material provides protection and visibility that is equivalent to safety glass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (f)(3) (xi) and (xii) of the final rule require that transparent material be kept clean and be replaced
when it is cracked, broken, scratched or damaged in any other way that may create a hazard for the operator. These requirements
parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of the final rule requires that deflectors be installed in front of each cab to deflect whipping
saplings and branches. This provision also requires that deflectors be located so they do not impede visibility or
access to the cab. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments
opposing the provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(xiv) of the final rule requires that the height of each cab entrance be at least 52 inches, or 1.3 meters,
from the floor of the cab. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. No commenters opposed this requirement.

Paragraph (f)(3)(xv) of the final rule requires that each machine operated near yarding systems (high lead and skyline)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f)(4) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying that each forklift truck used in logging operations be equipped
with an overhead guard. The overhead guard must meet the requirements of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME) B56.6&hyph;1987 (with addenda), ``Safety Standard for Rough Terrain Forklift Trucks.'' This incorporation
by reference of ASME B56.6&hyph;1987, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with
the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides
the requisite information regarding access to the text of ASME B56.6&hyph;1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, OSHA had included forklift trucks in the provisions requiring installation of ROPS and FOPS.
However, commenters informed OSHA that the manufacture of forklift trucks used in rough terrain conditions such
as the logging industry are covered by the ASME standard (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;47, Tr. W1 224), and that forklift
trucks are manufactured with overhead protection, rather than ROPS and FOPS (Ex. 5&hyph;47). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that this overhead protection requirement is necessary and will adequately protect logging forklift
operators from falling objects. Since the mast assembly of the forklift truck prevents it from rolling onto its top,
ROPS protection is not necessary. When accidents do occur, forklift trucks are more likely to tip over on their sides.
OSHA believes that, in the event of a tipover, the seat belt requirement contained in this standard will prevent operators
from being pinned or crushed by the truck or overhead guard by safely restraining them within the cab. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (f)(4) OSHA has not included a provision excepting fork lift trucks placed into service before the final
rule from being equipped with overhead guards. The manufacturing requirements for rough terrain forklift trucks
have been in place since 1978. Since the useful life of these machines is approximately 10 years, OSHA is confident
that almost all forklift trucks currently used in the logging industry do contain overhead guards meeting the ASME
standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(5) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding machine access. Paragraph (f)(5)(i)
of the final rule requires that machine access be provided for each machine when the operator or another employee must
climb onto the machine to enter the cab or an operating element to perform maintenance. This provision also requires
that the machine access system meet the requirement of the SAE J185 June 1988, standard on ``Recommended Practice
for Access systems for Off-Road Machines.'' This incorporation by reference of SAE J185, June 1988, has been approved
by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final
rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text
of SAE J185, June 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained machine access provisions. The proposed rule
specified that steps, ladders, handhold, catwalks, or railings installed after the effective date of this standard
comply with the SAE J185, June 1981, or be in accordance with a design by a professional engineer which offers equivalent
employee protection. There were no comments opposing the proposed provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes this provision is necessary to prevent logging injuries due to slips and falls. The WIR survey indicated
that these types of injuries accounted for almost one-fourth of all logging injuries reported, and that 28 percent
of all injuries resulting from falls involved machines and vehicles (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that compliance
with the SAE standard, in conjunction with work practices and training, will prevent these types of accidents. OSHA
notes that in the final rule, the reference to the SAE standard has been updated from the 1981 to the 1988 edition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of the final rule requires that each machine cab have a second means of egress. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement. According
to one commenter, nearly all logging machines currently in use have a second means of egress (Ex. 5&hyph;29). Therefore,
OSHA does not believe compliance with this provision will be burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (f)(5) (iii) and (iv) of the final rule require that walking and working surfaces of each machine have slip
resistant surfaces and be kept free of waste, debris and other material which might result in slipping, falling or
fire. These requirements parallel provisions contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received three comments opposing these provisions (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;55). These commenters
stated that the debris must be hazardous (Ex. 5&hyph;7) and that the requirement should be changed to indicate that
the walkways of machines should be ``substantially free'' of debris (Ex. 5&hyph;55). As discussed above, slips,
trips and falls account for a significant number of injuries in the logging industry. The Agency's primary intent
in this provision is to minimize the potential for employees to slip, trip or fall when mounting or dismounting a machine.
OSHA believes these provisions will reduce the hazards that result in those types of injuries. OSHA does not agree
with the characterization implied by the commenters that this provision requires employers to keep every machine
walking and working surface ``spotless'' at all times. OSHA is aware that in outdoors environments material may accumulate
on machine surfaces. OSHA is only requiring that when such accumulated material might result in a fire or in an employee
slipping or falling that it must be removed.

Exhaust Systems

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(6) of the final rule contains various requirements regarding exhaust pipes and mufflers. Paragraphs
(f)(6) (i) and (ii) of the final rule require that exhaust pipes on each machine be so located that exhaust is directed
away from the operator, and be mounted or guarded to protect the employee from accidental contact. These provisions
have been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. OSHA
did not receive any comments opposing these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(6) (iii) of the final rule requires that exhaust pipes be equipped with spark arresters. This provision
also provides that when an engine is equipped with a turbocharger, spark arresters are not required. The proposed
rule also required a spark arrester for each machine, but did not make an exception for machines equipped with turbochargers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that spark arresters were not needed when engines are turbocharged (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;16,
5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters said
that the flow of exhaust gases through the turbocharger requires sufficient time for any sparks to be extinguished
and unburned fuel and particulate matter to be burned. One commenter said that functional turbocharged engines do
not produce exhaust sparks like normally aspirated engines (Ex. 5&hyph;27). For this reason, these commenters said
turbochargers were an acceptable substitute for spark arresters (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In addition, the U.S. Forest Service
allows turbochargers in lieu of spark arresters (Ex. 5&hyph;16). Based on this evidence, OSHA has incorporated an
exception to the use of spark arresters when the machine engine is turbocharged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(6)(iv) of the final rule requires that the muffler provided by the manufacturer, or the equivalent,
be in place at all times the machine is in operation. This provision is the same as the corresponding provisions of the
proposal and the pulpwood logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement.

Brakes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(7) of the final rule specifies provisions regarding machine brakes. Paragraph (f)(7)(i) of the final
rule requires that the brakes must be sufficient to hold each machine and its maximum load on the slopes on which the
machine is being operated. As discussed above, rated capacity is the maximum load a machine was designed by the manufacturer
to handle. This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. Machine brake provisions are also included in various
State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K), and in the 1978 ANSI logging
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22). These commenters also said
that OSHA should include provisions requiring brakes to meet certain criteria in respective SAE and ANSI standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The variety of terrain encountered in logging operations makes the adequacy of brakes a critical safety issue. For
example, information presented in the preamble to the proposed rule indicated that an operator was unable to stop
the machine he was operating on a slope and the machine rolled over (54 FR 18799&hyph;80). The injured operator was
trapped in a cab for 45 minutes until he could be rescued. This provision requires that the braking system, that consists
of the service and emergency brakes, must be adequate to hold the machine and its maximum allowable load on the slope.
For certain machines (tractors and rubber tired skidders), employers can look to national consensus standards for
guidance on brake system performance (See SAE J1041, October 1991, ``Breaking System Test Procedure and Braking
Performance Criteria for Agricultural Tractors'' and SAE J1178, June 1987, ``Braking Performance_Rubber Tired
Skidders''). However, these standards do not cover all machines used in logging operations. Therefore, OSHA is specifying
certain minimum brake system requirements for all machines used in logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(7)(ii) requires that each machine be equipped with a secondary braking system, such as an emergency
brake or parking brake. This provision also requires that the secondary system be effective in stopping the machine
and maintaining parking performance, regardless of the direction of travel or of whether the engine is running. These
requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. These provisions are also contained in the
1978 ANSI logging standard. There were no comments opposing these provisions.

Guarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (f)(8) (i) and (ii) of the final standard requires that each machine be equipped with guarding to protect
employees from exposed moving elements and flying objects. These provisions also require that guarding must meet
the requirements specified in subpart O of part 1910. These provisions clarify that guarding requirement also applies
to each machine used in debarking, limbing and chipping. The proposed standard also contained a provision requiring
machine guarding. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters stated that the provision should be applied only to stationary equipment to prevent misapplication
to mobile equipment (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57). OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters'
recommendation. The Agency believes that both mobile and stationary machines pose a risk of injury due to exposure
to moving parts. According to the WIR survey, a significant number of employee injuries involved mobile equipment
(Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that employees working with or near both types of machine need to be protected. Additionally,
requiring all machines to be guarded eliminates the ambiguity as to whether a machine is stationary or mobile (e.g.
mobile machines that are used in place, such as a trailer mounted chipper). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that guarding satisfies the requirements of subpart O when it is in the form of a specially constructed and
installed barrier or when the structure of the machine itself prevents employee contact with the moving element of
the machine. Each machine shall be equipped with guarding to protect employees from exposure to moving elements,
such as but not limited to, shafts, pulleys, belts on conveyors, and gears, in accordance with the requirements of
subpart O of part 1910.

Paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of the final rule requires that the guarding on each machine be in place at all times the machine
is in operation. This provision was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. This provision makes explicit OSHA's
intent in the proposed rule that machines be equipped with guarding and that such guarding not be removed or otherwise
disabled while the machine is in operation. If machine guarding is removed or disabled, employees still remain exposed
to the danger of moving elements and flying objects when they are near or using the machine. OSHA believes the reasoning
and explanation for requiring that chain-saw chain brakes be engaged when starting the machine and not be removed
is also applicable to this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (g) of the final rule, OSHA has included various requirements regarding vehicles when used off public
roads in logging operations. OSHA has decided to include a separate paragraph on vehicles in this final rule because
of the confusion commenters said existed in the definition and requirements regarding ``mobile equipment'' verses
``motor vehicles'' in the proposed rule (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22). Certain of the proposed
provisions on vehicles were limited to personnel transport vehicles. In the final rule, OSHA has defined vehicles
to include trucks and trailers used to transport logs and machines, as well as personnel transport vehicles. Therefore,
the provisions covering vehicles apply to all vehicles used in any logging operation. OSHA believes that the reasoning
and explanation supporting the need for protection for those in personnel transport vehicles also apply to operators
and passengers of other vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received some comment that employee-provided vehicles should be excepted from the standard's vehicle requirements
(Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39). OSHA has not distinguished between employer-provided and employee-provided
equipment anywhere in this standard. OSHA believes that when any equipment is used in logging operations, the employer
is responsible for assuring that it is in proper working condition. However, this final standard does not address
the personal vehicle an employee drives on public roads. By contrast, when the employer allows employees to use their
own vehicles to transport themselves and other employees off public roads to and from logging work sites rather than
providing such transportation, those vehicles are exposed to the unique hazards of logging operations. Such vehicles
must be adequately equipped and properly running, just as employer provided vehicles must be, in order to cross what
may be difficult terrain and other hazardous conditions encountered enroute to and from the logging site. The OSH
Act imposes on the employer the responsibility for compliance with standards and for assuring safe conditions in
the workplace, even if the employee provides the vehicle for the logging operation.

OSHA believes it is necessary in the final rule to specify requirements for vehicles used to transport employees off
public roads and vehicles used to perform logging operations. The record shows that a number of injuries and fatalities
have occurred in the logging industry that involve vehicles (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 4&hyph;61, 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2), OSHA is requiring the employer to assure that each vehicle used to transport employees
off public roads or to perform any logging operation, including vehicles provided by employees, is maintained, and
is inspected before initial use during a workshift. These provisions also require that defects or damage be repaired
or the vehicle be replaced before work is started. These are the same general maintenance and inspection as required
for machine and tools. OSHA believes that the explanation and reasoning for including these provisions in the paragraphs
covering PPE, tools and machine apply here as well. (See discussion above of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i),
(e)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(i), and (f)(1)(ii).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) in the final rule in an effort to clarify its proposed intention. As
stated above, commenters said it was not clear in the proposed rule whether the definition of ``mobile equipment''
included both machines and vehicles, and therefore, whether the general maintenance and inspection requirements
applied to both types of equipment. ``Mobile equipment'' was defined in the proposal as that kind of equipment that
includes mobility as a part of its work function. In the final rule, OSHA is defining machines and vehicles separately,
and placing the requirements governing each in different paragraphs. In making these clarifications, however,
the Agency emphasizes that all mobile equipment used in logging operations, whether vehicles or machines, must operate
properly, and that maintenance and inspections are needed to assure that only properly functioning mobile equipment
is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(3) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that operating and maintenance instructions
are available in each vehicle. This provision also requires that each vehicle operator and maintenance employee
comply with the instructions. These are the same provisions as required for machines. OSHA believes that the explanation
and reasoning for including these provisions in the paragraph covering machines applies to vehicles as well. (See
discussion above of paragraph (f)(1)(iii).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(4) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each vehicle operator has a valid operator's
license for the class of vehicle being operated. This provision applies to all vehicle operators, not just employees
who operate personnel transport vehicles. The proposal applied the licensing requirement only to personnel transport
vehicle operators and no comments opposing the requirement were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that it is also essential that an employee operating any type of vehicle possess a current license for
that vehicle. Any employee operating a vehicle for logging operations needs to have met the necessary qualifications
and shown that they have operated the vehicle in a manner responsible enough to maintain a current license. This provision
ensures that the employee has the proper kind of license for the type of vehicle being operated and the load being carried.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(5) of the final rule requires that mounting steps and handholds be provided on each vehicle whenever
it is necessary to prevent an employee from being injured while entering or leaving the vehicle. The proposed rule
specified that mounting steps and handholds be provided for every personnel transport vehicle. The 1978 ANSI logging
standard also contained a similar provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed applying this provision to pickup trucks (Ex. 5&hyph;51). This commenter said steps would
rip off of high center pickup trucks during the ride. In addition this commenter said that steps would prevent access
of fire fighting vehicles to roads that have water barriers or speed bumps. OSHA does not believe the record supports
the exceptions recommended by the commenter. First, according to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all injuries resulted
from falls from vehicles (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Second, there are mounting steps for vehicles used in logging operations
that can be retractable or high enough to prevent contact with the ground while the vehicle is moving. In addition,
the record does not indicate that there are many speed bumps on logging roads. OSHA is aware that mounting steps and
handholds may not be necessary for every vehicle. OSHA is only requiring mounting steps when there is a danger that
an employee could be injured while entering or leaving the vehicle without being provided with such assistance.

Paragraph (g)(6) of the final rule requires that each seat be securely fastened to the vehicle. The final rule adopts
the proposed requirement and applies it to all vehicles used in logging operations. The 1978 ANSI logging standard
also contained this requirement. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(7) of the final rule requires applies the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(v), (f)(2)(vii),
(f)(2)(x), (f)(2)(xiii) and paragraph (f)(7) to each vehicle used to transport any employee off public roads or to
perform any logging operation, including any vehicle provided by an employee. OSHA believes these general work practices
and brake requirements are necessary to prevent accidents involving vehicles as well as machines. OSHA believes
the reasoning and explanation for including these general provisions in the paragraph covering machines applies
here as well.

Paragraph (h)&blank;Tree Harvesting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (h) of the final rule, OSHA establishes various general and specific work practice requirements regarding
tree harvesting. OSHA believes these work practice requirements are necessary, especially given the high injury
rate in the logging industry. According to the WIR survey, in more than two-thirds of all reported injuries unsafe
working practices contributed to the accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The work practices specified in this paragraph address
those work practices that when not used contributed to accidents such as those reported in the WIR survey (e.g., co-worker
activity, working too fast, misjudging time or distance to avoid injury, using wrong cutting method). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that those provisions in the proposed rule that specified requirements other than work practices (e.g.,
equipment specifications) have been moved to the applicable equipment specification paragraphs of the final rule.

General Requirements

Paragraph (h)(1)(i) requires that trees not be felled in a manner that may create a hazard for an employee, such as,
but not limited to, falling on an employee, or striking a rope, cable, power line or machine. The proposed rule and the
1978 ANSI logging standard contained similar provisions. The proposed rule required that trees not be felled in a
manner that could endanger an employee.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters said that the proposed provision was too broad to be useful since they believed all felling activities
are dangerous (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;63). While OSHA agrees that it may not be possible to eliminate all
hazards in a workplace, the employer does have the responsibility to prevent or minimize hazards the employer can
reasonably anticipate. To comply with this provision, it is incumbent on the employer to train employees in proper
felling work practices and to point out when employee actions or workplace conditions could create hazards for employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(ii) requires that the immediate supervisor be consulted before felling is commenced, whenever
unfamiliar or unusually hazardous conditions necessitate the supervisor's approval. The final rule adopts the
provision contained in the proposed rule. One commenter supported the proposed requirement (Tr. W1 85). He said that
consulting supervisors when heavy accumulations of snow are present would prevent injuries. OSHA believes that
unusual, hazardous situations may arise during felling operations and the supervisor should be involved in making
decisions about the safest way to fell a tree. These situations may include, but are not limited to, felling very large
or tall trees; cutting trees whose lean, location or structure make it difficult to fell in the desired or a safe direction.
Adding the supervisor's knowledge, training and experience to the decision-making process should help to minimize
the hazards to loggers. In addition, this consultation process is especially important when logging crews are relatively
new and may not have dealt with such situations before. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of the final rule requires that no yarding machine be operated within two tree lengths of any
tree being manually felled. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard
also contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised questions about or discussed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;67; Tr.
W1 104, W2 197). None of the commenters denied that yarding machine operators may be endangered when they operate too
close to manual felling activities. However, two commenters stated that the provision should be revised because,
in some circumstances, the assistance of a yarding machine is necessary to assure that the tree is felled in the desired
direction or to keep the area clear (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;67). For example, one commenter said that failure of yarders
to clear an area of a build up of felled trees or logs can result in timber breakage or can pose problems for fellers working
on slopes (Ex. 5&hyph;67). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, OSHA believes that allowing yarding machines within two tree lengths of trees being manually felled would
pose a risk of harm to both the machine operator and the feller. First, a manual feller who is cutting a tree is concentrating
on that work activity and not on other logging activities in the area. If that tree were to fall on a yarding machine that
is too close to a manual felling operation, the machine operator could be injured by the tree. Second, it also is important
for their own safety that manual fellers work at a safe distance from yarding activities. Yarder operators and chasers
and choker setters concentrating on slinging and moving logs could cause injury to the feller if a tree or log were to
shift, roll or slide suddenly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, yarding machine operators are often working downhill from manual fellers. It may be dangerous for the operator
to approach the feller because the falling tree could roll or slide into the machine. Fourth, the requirements of this
paragraph can still be met even where the feller and yarder work as a team. After the feller has cut a tree and is moving
on to size up another tree for cutting, the yarder can remove the felled tree before the feller begins cutting the next
tree. The feller should check to make sure the yarder has removed the tree out of the work area before he starts cutting.
Therefore, OSHA believes that its general rule that each work area be separated by at least two tree lengths should
also apply to yarding and manual felling operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, who said that ``cat skidding crews'' in the northwest work in close proximity of tree fellers, suggested
that this provision should allow skidding directly away from a timber feller as long as the feller is not actively trying
to fell a tree (Ex. 5&hyph;43). OSHA notes that the final rule does not prohibit what the commenter suggests. The final
rule only says that yarding machines shall not be within a two-tree length distance while manual felling is in progress.
The final rule does not prohibit the yarding operator from clearing logs when the feller is not engaged in cutting trees.
While the feller is moving onto the next tree and assessing its condition, this provision allows yarder operators
to remove the trees that have been felled, provided that the other requirements or this paragraph have been met (e.g.,
the feller acknowledging that it is safe for the yarder to enter the work area). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of the final standard requires that no employee approach a felling operation closer than two
tree lengths of the tree being felled until the feller acknowledges it is safe to do so. This provision includes an exception
to the two-tree length requirement when the employer demonstrates that a team of employees is necessary to manually
fell a particular tree. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained provisions specifying
that employees remain two tree lengths from the feller. The proposed rule did not contain the felling team exception.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters urged OSHA to permit exceptions to the two tree-length requirement (Tr. W1 152, 183&hyph;86,
W2 163, OR 126). These commenters discussed, for example, the need for shovelers to work in conjunction with fellers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes the two tree-length distance requirement is necessary for several reasons. First, a feller may not
be aware of approaching employees due to noise or the feller's concentration on the work. It is therefore possible
that employees may inadvertently enter an area where a tree is falling. This could result in injury to the approaching
employee, and even to the feller if he attempts to take corrective action. According to the WIR survey, six percent
of employees injured reported that co-worker activity had contributed to the accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State
of Washington study indicated that eight percent of employees who were killed were hit by a tree being felled by another
employee (Ex. 4&hyph;129). According to the OSHA FCI report, nine logging employees were killed when they were struck
by a tree that was being cut by another logger (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Second, an approaching employee could be injured if
he is unaware of or misjudges the falling direction of a tree. The feller is the best judge of the direction that a tree
is likely to fall and, therefore, should be the one to signal when a work area is safe. Third, approaching employees
could be injured if a tree were to inadvertently fall in the wrong direction. The best way for employees to prevent such
injury is to remain clear of the work area while the felling operation is being conducted. Once the felling of the tree
is completed, the feller can signal that it is safe for other employees to approach. Therefore, OSHA believes the safer
approach for both the feller and other employees is to wait until the feller has acknowledged it is safe to enter the
felling area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included an exception to this rule for particular situations when more than one employee is needed to manually
fell a particular tree. However, OSHA notes that this exception covers only manual fellers and those whom the employer
demonstrates are needed to assist in manually felling a tree (e.g., shovelers). It does not include mechanical felling
operations and it does permit machines to enter the manual felling area. In those situations, paragraphs (h)(1)(iii)
and (h)(1)(v) apply. If a machine is necessary to push or pull over a tree, the manual feller must move at least two tree
lengths away and must not enter the area until the machine operator acknowledges that it is safe. OSHA notes that this
is not a blanket exception for all team felling activities. The general rule is that no person is to approach a feller
until the feller has indicated it is safe to do so. The exception is meant to be applied on a case-by-case basis. That
is, the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a particular tree or a particular felling situation requires
a team. Only then is more than one person allowed within the immediate work area. In addition, the employer bears the
burden of showing that a team is necessary to manually fell the tree in that particular situation.

Paragraph (h)(1)(v) of the final rule requires that no employee approach a mechanical felling operation closer than
two tree lengths of the tree being felled until the machine operator has acknowledged that it is safe to do so. The proposed
rule required that employees remain clear of any mechanical felling operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments recommending that OSHA apply the two tree-length minimum work distance to mechanical
felling operations as well (Ex. 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74
through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W2 163, 197). These commenters said that such distance was needed, for example, to protect
other employees from flying metal fragments from broken mechanical disc saw blades. In addition, the reasoning and
explanation supporting the distance requirement for approaching fellers also applies to this provision. For example,
a feller-buncher operator who is not expecting an employee to enter the work area may move in reverse and not see the
employee in time to prevent an accident. OSHA has therefore added the two tree-length distance requirement to this
provision of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of the final rule requires that each danger tree, including lodged trees and snags, be felled,
removed or avoided. When the danger tree is felled or removed, it must be felled or removed using mechanical or other
techniques that minimize employee exposure before felling is commenced in the area of the danger tree. When the danger
tree is avoided, it must be marked and no work be conducted within two tree lengths of the danger tree, unless the employer
demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create a hazard for an employee. As defined in the final rule, a danger
tree includes any standing tree that presents a hazard to employees due to conditions such as, but not limited to, deterioration
or damage to the tree, and direction or lean of the tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule required that lodged trees be marked and lowered to the ground using mechanical or other safe techniques
before any work is continued within two tree lengths of the lodged tree. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions
to the two tree-length distance. Many State logging standards include requirements to fell danger trees or not to
commence work within a two tree-length distance of the danger tree (Ex. 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record shows that danger trees pose many hazards for employees. According to the WIR survey, 15 percent of those
injured said that the dangerous conditions of the tree had contributed to their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA
FCI report indicated that 23 logging employees were killed by danger trees (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received several comments on this proposed provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 17; Tr. W1 187, W2 6&hyph;7). Some commenters supported the provision (Ex. 5&hyph;39,
5&hyph;34). Some commenters suggested that this provision conflicts with other federal regulations requiring
retention of some ``snags'' to preserve wildlife habitats in the area (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, Tr. W2
6) and Rep. Jolene Unsoeld commented that OSHA should attempt to harmonize the final rule with various environmental
regulations (Ex. 17, 31). Other commenters said that OSHA's provision was excessive in those situations when a tree
is securely lodged a few feet above the ground (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 187, W2 6&hyph;7).
Another commenter said that prohibiting any felling within two tree-lengths of a danger tree would take a large volume
of timber out of production, especially strips of trees on steep slopes (Ex. 5&hyph;43). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns in the final rule. First, OSHA is more explicitly stating in the final
rule that dangers trees may be avoided, when necessary, rather than being felled or removed. OSHA believes that this
requirement harmonizes with and does not conflict with the rules and regulations of other Federal agencies. The U.S.
Department of the Interior participated in this rulemaking and did not indicate that this provision was in conflict
with their regulations (Ex. 5&hyph;50). The change to the final rule further clarifies OSHA's proposed intent that
danger trees do not have to be felled or removed. This provision of the final rule only requires two actions of the employer.
One, when the employer wishes to fell a danger tree, it must be removed or felled before other trees in the area are felled.
Two, when the employer elects not to fell or remove a danger tree, the employer must not conduct any other felling in
that area. Therefore, when other regulations require the preservation of a particular snag, this final standard
requires only that fellers be protected from potential injury from the snag. This is accomplished by keeping all other
felling activity out of the immediate area of that snag.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, in the final rule OSHA has addressed the concerns of other commenters by allowing work to commence within two
tree lengths of a marked danger tree, provided that the employer demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create
a hazard for an employee. This change will assure the safety of logging employees without removing significant timber
from production. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a distance of less than two tree
lengths will not create a hazard for an employee. Supervisors should actively participate in identifying and training
employees about providing safe distances. Whether a shorter distance does create a hazard is a case-by-case determination.
What constitutes a safe distance for other work to be conducted will require an evaluation of various factors such
as, but not limited to, the size of the danger tree, how secure it is, its condition, the slope of the work area, and the
presence of other employees in the area. For example, excessive root deterioration or damage might indicate that
the danger tree is unstable and that there is a possibility it could fall. In such case, a two tree-length distance would
be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters recommended that OSHA designate dislodging a tree by felling another one into it as a safe technique
``in certain situations'' (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). However, these commenters did not identify any situations
in which it would be safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. There is no information in the record that identifies any
situation in which it is safe to use domino felling to fell a danger tree. In fact, other commenters have indicated they
know of no situation when felling another tree into a danger tree is considered safe practice (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46).
OSHA also believes that it is not safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. First, there are already hazards associated
with domino felling trees that are not danger trees. Trying to domino fell danger trees such as lodged trees can only
increase the seriousness of the hazard. One of the factors that makes a tree a danger tree is that the physical damage
to the tree may cause it to fall in an unintended direction. Felling another tree into the danger tree increases the
potential for a misdirected fall. Second, the possibility exists that danger trees being domino felled also will
become lodged, thereby increasing the number of trees to be avoided or removed and, consequently, increasing the
risk to employees when those lodged trees are removed. The safest way to remove a lodged tree, first is remove all unnecessary
employees from the area and then to hook the tree to a skidder, and pull the tree down (Ex. 5&hyph;43). Therefore, OSHA
is not permitting removal of any tree, including a danger tree, by domino felling (See discussion of paragraph (h)(1)(ix).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each danger tree be carefully checked for signs of loose bark,
broken branches and limbs or other damage before it is felled or removed. This provision also requires that loose bark
and other damage that may create a hazard be removed before felling or removing the tree. This requirement has been
adopted from the proposed rule. In the proposed rule, OSHA specified that snags be carefully checked for dangerous
bark before they are felled and that accessible loose bark be removed before felling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;65). This commenter said that removing loose bark increases dangers
from above since upper bark will slough off if lower bark is no longer supporting it. As such, this commenter recommended
that OSHA require loose bark to be pinned to the tree. OSHA has changed the final rule to include removing loose bark
or holding it in place.

Paragraph (h)(1)(viii) of the final rule requires that felling activity on any slope when rolling or sliding of trees
or logs is reasonably foreseeable be kept uphill from, or on the same level as, previously felled trees. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging rules. Various State standards contain similar
requirements (Ex. 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;22, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received various comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;74
through 5&hyph;92). Several commenters said that OSHA should more clearly define what constitutes sloping terrain
(Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters suggested that the provision
be limited to slopes exceeding 25 or 35 percent. They also indicated that mechanical felling in southern states should
be excluded because slopes are gentler and shorter than in other regions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record shows that this provision is necessary to protect employees from being injured by rolling or sliding trees.
The WIR survey supports the need for this work practice requirement. According to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths
of the workers who reported injuries said that their accidents occurred on moderately or steeply sloped terrain,
and 10 percent of all injured workers blamed the steep terrain for their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report
indicated that 20 employees were killed when they were struck by rolling trees or logs (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has not adopted a precise minimum slope that would trigger this requirement or excempt any region from the requirement,
however, the final rule does address the commenters' concerns by limiting this provision to those sloping terrains
where rolling or sliding of felled trees is reasonably foreseeable. OSHA is aware that logging work sites are often
not completely level, and that many logging sites could be considered to be sloping terrain. Elements other than the
mere slope of the terrain also must be considered in determining whether there is a reasonable possibility that the
trees could roll or slide. When a given slope does not present the reasonable possibility that felled trees will slide
or roll, OSHA agrees that this requirement should not apply. However, when the terrain slopes to the degree that a reasonable
employer would believe that sliding or rolling is foreseeable, then this work practice requirement is necessary
to protect loggers from being injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether a particular terrain slope poses a possibility that trees or logs may slide or roll requires an assessment
of the condition of the terrain. All conditions that might contribute to a hazard must be considered (e.g., tree size,
weather conditions). For example, when the terrain is either wet or covered with snow or ice, the possibility of trees
sliding and rolling is greater and these conditions must be considered in determining whether uphill felling is required.
As long as the hazard of sliding or rolling trees exists, felling must be done on the uphill side even if industry practice
has been downhill felling, or even if roads have generally been located on the tops of ridges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that this provision of the final rule may be counter to some environmental considerations in timber
harvest plans which require opposite felling schemes (Ex. 5&hyph;7). However, the commenter has not provided substantive
information to support his assertion. OSHA has previously discussed the danger of manual felling operations being
conducted in adjacent work areas due to the potential for a felled tree falling into another work area. In light of that
the fact that most trees fall down hill when felled, the hazard to employees working below another felling activity
exposes those employees to an unacceptable risk of injury or death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter said downhill felling should be permitted because it can reduce the feller's fatigue (Ex.
5&hyph;12). While NIOSH suggests that worker fatigue may be a factor in logging accidents, NIOSH did not recommend
downhill felling as being a method to reduce worker fatigue (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Rather, NIOSH said that the employer
should reduce worker fatigue and the potential for accidents that results from such fatigue by planning appropriate
work schedules. NIOSH suggested that the employer's planning of work schedules should include an evaluation of the
amount of heat stress, physical exertion and other factors contributing to fatigue in planning those work schedules.
OSHA agrees with NIOSH that planning appropriate work schedules rather than downhill felling would be the appropriate
way to reduce worker fatigue without exposing the employee to further hazards and to assure that jobs fit the capabilities
of the person. (OSHA is addressing these factors in its rulemaking on ergonomic safety and health management.)

Paragraph (h)(1)(ix) of the final rule prohibits the practice of domino felling. As previously discussed, domino
felling involves cutting wedges and making partial backcuts in a series of trees that form a continuous line. The last
tree is then felled into the line thus pushing the line of trees to the ground in a chain reaction fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This requirement was not included in the proposed rule, however, several commenters urged OSHA to prohibit domino
felling in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46; Tr. W2 231, OR 659). NIOSH said that domino felling was a hazardous
practice because there was a loss of stability in the standing tree when it had been backcut (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Therefore,
NIOSH recommended that OSHA include a requirement in the final rule allowing only one tree to be felled at a time. There
are also other hazards associated with domino felling. First, when trees are used to knock down other trees, the likelihood
that the trees will not fall in the expected direction is greatly increased. A small miscalculation in the falling
direction can be significantly magnified down the line and result in serious injury to the feller or other employees
in the area. In addition, a falling tree could hit another object and either fall in another direction or become lodged.
This would require an employee to fell the lodged tree, which is a hazardous operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Second, the hazards can be magnified when domino felling is not successful in knocking down the entire line of trees.
The feller may be placed in an extremely hazardous situation if he must try to fell any of the line of trees that may remain
standing. For example, part of the line of trees may have fallen over and lodged against the standing tree. A feller
who attempts to fell the final standing tree(s) could be injured when the lodged line of trees and the final tree finally
do fall. The risk of injury is greater because it is more likely that the lodged trees may fall in an unexpected direction,
and the combined weight of the lodged trees further increases the risk. In this sense, the prohibition against domino
felling is similar to the requirement in the final rule that trees be felled in a manner that prevents them from striking
things such as ropes, cables, or power lines. For these reasons, OSHA is requiring that trees be felled one at a time
rather than allowing trees to be used to knock down other trees.

Manual Felling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h)(2) of the final rule specifies various work practices for manual felling. OSHA believes these provisions
are essential to reduce the number of injuries that occur during felling activities. According to the WIR survey,
tree felling is the most dangerous activity in the logging industry. Of those who reported injuries in the WIR survey,
23 percent were engaged in felling trees at the time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 OSHA's FCI report also indicates that felling operations are the most hazardous operation in the logging industry
(Ex. 4&hyph;61). The report indicated that 43 percent of all employees who died did so when they were felling trees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The State of Washington study indicated that more than 40 percent of employees killed from 1977&hyph;83 were performing
felling operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). This study concluded that many of the deaths would have been prevented had logging
employees been following safe work practices and had remained out of hazardous areas (e.g., adjacent occupied work
areas). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One commenter said that certain of the work practices proposed by OSHA should not be required of each feller (Ex. 5&hyph;54).
This commenter said the work practices did not take into account the variation in feller experience, production requirements,
and the trees themselves. This commenter also said the work practice requirements did not allow for innovations in
felling technology and for recognition of other safe ways to perform felling tasks. OSHA points out that these work
practice requirements have been widely recognized and accepted in the logging industry. Most of the State logging
standards contain most of these work practices (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;23, 38J,
38K). These requirements were included in OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, that adopted the 1971 ANSI logging standard.
In addition, these requirements were contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The ANSI standards are national
consensus standards which were developed, approved and followed by the logging industry itself. Presumably, they
represent what the industry has viewed to be necessary and reasonable to prevent injuries and deaths in this high hazard
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In paragraph (h)(2)(i) of the final rule, OSHA requires that before a feller even begins felling a tree, a retreat path
must be planned and cleared. This provision also requires that the retreat path extend diagonally away from the expected
felling line. This provision also includes an exception to the diagonal retreat path when the employer demonstrates
that in the particular situation such a retreat path is not feasible or poses a greater hazard than an alternative retreat
path. The proposed rule contained a requirement for planning and clearing a retreat path before commencing cutting.
However, the proposed rule required that the retreat path ``extend back and diagonally to the rear'' of the expected
felling line. This language also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One commenter contended that a diagonal retreat path may not lead to the safest location in the felling area, therefore,
it would be inappropriate for OSHA to designate a required retreat direction in the standard (Ex. 5&hyph;35). The
record shows that the clearance of a retreat path so the feller is able to move rapidly and safely away from a falling
tree is essential to prevent injuries. According to the WIR survey, 24 percent of all reported injuries resulted from
being hit by a tree and half of these injuries involved falling trees. OSHA believes there are many kinds of hazards
that necessitate a quick and clear retreat path. For example, the tree being felled can split and part of the tree may
then fall in an unexpected direction. In heavily wooded areas, the tree being felled can strike another tree that can
cause the first tree or parts of either tree to fall or fly in an unexpected direction. In addition, planning and clearing
a path prior to cutting a tree is especially important when the terrain is covered with obstructions such as snow, water
or heavy undergrowth. These obstructions could cause the feller to be injured if they impede the feller's ability
to rapidly retreat or cause him to trip or fall. For these reasons, OSHA has retained the requirement to plan and clear
a retreat path before felling the tree.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has addressed in the final rule the concerns raised by the commenter. As a general rule, OSHA believes that a diagonal
retreat path is the safest location in the felling area. The ANSI standard, developed by persons experienced in the
logging industry, recognized that same general safe work practice. OSHA recognizes that when the retreat path is
planned prior to cutting, the employer may find that a diagonal retreat path poses greater hazards than an alternative
path. For example, excessive slopes, rocks or other trees in the path of a diagonal retreat may create hazards that
are not present in an alternative retreat path. In such cases, the final rule permits the employee to use an alternate
retreat path. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that the diagonal retreat path poses a greater hazard.
OSHA also notes that the exception is a case-by-case determination. That is, the general rule requiring a diagonal
retreat path is to be applied in all manual felling activities. The exception only applies when the feller, in planning
a particular retreat path, determines that a diagonal retreat poses a greater hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of the final rule requires that before each tree is felled, conditions shall be evaluated in
the work area and precautions taken so a hazard is not created for an employee. Conditions that must be evaluated include,
but are not limited to, snow and ice accumulation, wind, lean of the tree, dead limbs and location of other trees. This
provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. Many commenters discussed the hazardous nature of working
conditions in the logging industry, and noted that these conditions are constantly changing (Ex. 5&hyph;12, Tr.
W1 76, 88). Because conditions can change with each tree that is being felled, it is important that the feller assess
in advance the conditions and hazards that may be present. In order for fellers to understand what conditions and hazards
may be present and must be appraised, it is important that the employer should include this discussion in training
sessions and monthly safety and health meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of the final rule requires that each tree be checked for accumulations of snow or ice. This provision
also requires that accumulations of snow and ice that may create a hazard for an employee must be removed before felling
is started in the area or the area must be avoided. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One commenter said that this provision would require logging establishments to cease felling operations during
winter months (Ex. 5&hyph;51). OSHA does not agree with the characterization that the commenters draw about the proposed
rule. OSHA is aware that logging operations are carried out in many types of weather conditions. OSHA does not believe
that this provision requires logging operations to close down during the winter. However, when accumulations of
snow and ice may create a hazard for an employee, that hazard must be removed or avoided. The record shows that removing
or avoiding hazardous accumulations of snow and ice is necessary to protect logging employees from injury. According
to the WIR survey, six percent of employees injured said that weather conditions such as snow and ice had contributed
to their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of the final rule requires that when a spring pole or other tree is under stress, no employee other
than the feller may be closer than two tree lengths when the stress is released. This provision was included in the proposed
rule, however, the proposed rule did not require that employees be at least two tree lengths away. Rather, it required
that employees be in the clear when the stress is released. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Various commenters recommended that OSHA establish a uniform minimum safe distance for all work areas (Ex. 5&hyph;18,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W2 163, 197). OSHA agrees
with these commenters and has included a minimum two tree-length distance in this provision. The record shows that
this distance is necessary to protect employees from being injured or killed by trees under stress. According to the
WIR survey, 11 percent of employees who reported injuries said that wood being under tension had contributed to their
accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report indicated that four employees were killed when they were struck by propelled
or whiplashing tree limbs (Ex. 4&hyph;61).

Paragraphs (h)(2) (v), (vi) and (vii) require undercutting and backcutting of each tree being felled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (h)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree being felled be undercut unless the employer
demonstrates that felling the particular tree without an undercut will not create a hazard for an employee. This paragraph
also requires that the undercut be of a size so the tree will not split and will fall in the intended direction. The proposed
rule contained a provision requiring undercutting of each tree being felled, however, the proposed provision did
not provide for any exceptions. OSHA received many comments on this provision, which have been discussed above in
the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (h)(2) (vi) and (vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree be backcut. OSHA is also requiring
that the backcut allow for sufficient hinge wood to guide the tree and prevent it from prematurely slipping or twisting
off the trunk. OSHA is requiring that the backcut be above the horizontal cut of the undercut. In the final rule, OSHA
is allowing one exception to the backcut requirements. In tree pulling operations, the backcut may be at or below the
horizontal cut of the undercut. The proposed rule also contained provision requiring backcutting of each tree being
felled. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions to the backcut requirement. OSHA received many comments on
these provisions, which have been discussed above in the Major Issues section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h)(3) of the final rule establishes various necessary work practices for bucking and limbing activities.
According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of the reported logging injuries occurred when the employee was bucking or
limbing (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report showed that 16 employees were killed during bucking and limbing operations
(Ex. 4&hyph;61). The work practice requirements contained in this paragraph address the hazards presented by log
movement on slopes, by wind-thrown timber and by trees that are yarded for bucking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(3)(i) of the final rule requires that bucking and limbing that are done on any slope where rolling or
sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable must be done on the uphill side of the tree, unless the employer demonstrates
that it is not feasible for bucking or limbing to be done on the uphill side. This paragraph also requires that whenever
bucking or limbing is done on the downhill side, the tree must be secured against movement to prevent rolling or sliding.
The proposed rule also contained a provision requiring bucking and limbing to be done from the uphill side. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision was supported by one commenter (Ex. 5&hyph;17). The record shows that bucking and limbing from the
uphill side is necessary to protect employees from being hit or crushed by rolling or sliding trees or logs. As discussed
above, according to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths of workers who reported injuries were working on moderate
to steep terrain at the time of their accident, and 10 percent of all injured workers said steep terrain had been a factor
in their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Bucking or limbing can cause loss of support for the tree and cause it to shift, roll
or slide unexpectedly. Blocking or chocking a tree on a slope can never provide as much protection as avoiding the hazard
in the first place. The record shows that the only work method in which it can be assured that an employee will not be hurt
by a rolling or sliding tree is by performing bucking and limbing on the uphill side. As such, bucking and limbing from
the downhill side is permitted only in those cases when the employer is able to demonstrate that it is not feasible to
work from the uphill side. In those particular cases, the tree must be restrained to reduce as much as possible the possibility
of the tree rolling or sliding. OSHA notes that the burden of demonstrating infeasibility is on the employer. In addition,
the issue of the infeasibility of bucking and limbing from the uphill side must be determined on a case-by-case basis
when the tree and the conditions in the area are carefully assessed.

Paragraph (h)(3)(ii) requires that when bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees, precautions must be taken to prevent
the root wad, tree butt, or logs from striking an employee. These precautions include, but are not limited to, chocking
or moving the tree to a stable position before bucking or limbing. The proposed rule also contained a requirement for
bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees. However, the proposed rule did not specify what precautions should be taken.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that the proposed provision was too general to be useful (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74
through 5&hyph;92). These commenters said that this was one of a series of proposed work practice requirements which
should be deleted from the final rule and included in topics that must be covered in training sessions. OSHA believes
that this work practice requirement is necessary to address the significant risk of injury during these activities.
According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of reported injuries occurred during bucking and limbing. OSHA does agree
with the commenters that these work practice requirements should also be addressed in training sessions.

Chipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (h)(4) of the final rule, OSHA has specified various work practices regarding chipping that is performed
at in-woods locations. Paragraph (h)(4)(i) of the final rule requires that access covers or doors not be opened until
the drum and disc is at a complete stop. The access covers and doors are the means by which employees are safeguarded
from the risk of contacting these parts while they are moving. This provision is adopted from the proposed rule. The
1978 ANSI logging standard also contains a similar provision. OSHA did not receive any comment opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that this requirement is necessary to keep employees away from the dangerous moving drums, discs, knives
and blower blades of a chipper. OSHA's FCI reported indicated that two employees have been killed while operating
a chipper or trying to free jammed logs (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The moving chipper mechanism presents significant hazards,
and employees need protection from contact with those mechanisms when they are moving. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of the final rule requires that infeed and discharge ports be guarded to prevent contact with
the disc, knives, or blower blades. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments
opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of the final rule requires that the chipper be shut down and locked out in accordance with 29
CFR 1910.147 when an employee performs any servicing of maintenance on the chipper. The proposed rule required that
the chipper be shut down and locked out before an employee works in the infeed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing lockout of the chipper while working on the infeed. OSHA received one comment
stating that lockout should be expanded to apply when an employee is working on the drive mechanism or chipping disc
(Ex. 5&hyph;28). The lockout/tagout standard, 29 CFR 1910.147, applies to servicing and maintenance of all machines
and equipment in which the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unexpected
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 energization or start up of the machine or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees.
This includes machines and equipment used in logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lockout-tagout standard permits employers to either place a lock or tag on any machine before beginning servicing.
However, OSHA believes that the environmental conditions involved in logging operations necessitates the use of
locks rather than tags when servicing chippers. As OSHA stated in the preamble of the lockout/tagout standard, it
is intended to interact with any new or revised standard to address the use of specific control measures on an individual
basis (54 FR 36644, 36665, Sept. 1, 1989). Selection of the specific method of control, at that time, will reflect a
thorough evaluation of the extent of exposure to the hazard, the risk of injury involving the particular machine or
industry, and the feasibility of applying a particular method of control. OSHA also pointed in the preamble of the
lockout/tagout standard that damage to or loss of tagout devices is a serious drawback to the use of tagout. Logging
operations are carried out in all kinds of weather, including rain, snow, ice and wind, and there is a significant possibility
that tags could be damaged or lost. In such circumstances, OSHA believes only locking machinery will provide adequate
protection for employees who are servicing it. Therefore, OSHA is requiring chippers to be shut down and lockout out
before an employee performs any servicing or maintenance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of the final rule requires that detached chippers be chocked during usage on any slope when movement
of the chipper is reasonably foreseeable. As with other mobile equipment that is intended to be operated from a stationary
position, the unexpected movement of the equipment can endanger employees who are either operating the equipment
or in the path of the equipment when it moves. The vibration caused by the operation of the equipment can enhance the
potential for unintended equipment movement. Chocking of mobile equipment to prevent movement is recognized throughout
industry as a necessary and appropriate means to prevent unintended movement. For example, OSHA requires in 29 CFR
1910.178(k)(1) that trailers be chocked before being boarded by powered industrial trucks.

Paragraph (h)(5) specifies various work practice requirements covering yarding activities. Paragraph (h)(5)(i)
of the final rule requires that logs not be moved until each employee is in the clear. This provision has been adopted
from the proposed rule. Movement of logs when employees are in the immediate area can result in an injury to those employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the WIR survey, almost 20 percent of employees injured were involved in yarding operations at the time
of their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). When a log is moved on uneven, unimproved terrain, the exact path that the log will
follow is impossible to predict. When they are being moved, logs may roll over, or the loose end of a log may flip back
and forth (fishtail). Movement in an unanticipated direction can cause the log to strike an employee, causing serious
injury. OSHA has included this requirement in the final rule to ensure that when logs are moved, all personnel must
be safely positioned and not exposed to a hazard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of the final rule requires that each choker be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side or end
of the tree or log when rolling or sliding is reasonably foreseeable, unless the employer demonstrates that it is not
feasible in the particular situation to hook or unhook the choker from the uphill side. This provision also requires
that when the choker is hooked or unhooked from the downhill side, the log shall be securely blocked or chocked to prevent
rolling or swinging. The proposed rule also specified that chokers be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side when
feasible unless the log is securely blocked to prevent rolling or swinging. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained
a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees who hook and unhook chokers on sloping terrains face the same hazard of rolling or sliding logs as do fellers,
buckers, limbers and other employees. According to the WIR survey, 19 percent of the injuries reported occurred during
choker setting, hooking and unhooking (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In addition, the WIR survey indicates that nearly three-fifths
of all workers injured were working on moderate to steep terrain at the time of their accidents. The final rule makes
clear OSHA's intention that all hooking and unhooking of chokers must be from the uphill side or end when rolling or
sliding is reasonably foreseeable. This is the only work location in which it can be assured that an employee will not
be hurt by a rolling or sliding tree. For this reason, hooking or unhooking chokers from the downhill side is not permitted
simply because the tree has been secured with a chock. Rather, the employer must evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether
it is possible to hook or unhook from the uphill side. Only when the employer has demonstrated that hooking or unhooking
the choker from the uphill side or end is not feasible in the particular situation is hooking or unhooking the choker
from the down hill side permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of the final rule requires that each choker be positioned near the end of the log or tree length.
This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Positioning a choker at the end of the log ensures that the log is moved along its longitudinal axis. Hooking up and skidding
a tree or log requires much less energy than trying to move the tree or log sideways. If an employee were to try to move
a tree or log by dragging it sideways (perpendicular to its longitudinal axis) the tree or log could become wedged behind
another tree, a rock, or a stump, causing the premature failure of the haulage equipment and the possibility of employee
injury if the restraint were to suddenly break or release the tree or log. Because of these hazards, the usual practice
in non-cable yarding is to skid or drag a tree or log when moving it. When trees or logs are skidded, the choker is hooked
to the end of the tree or log and it is pulled along the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(iv) of the final rule requires that each machine be positioned during winching so the machine and
winch are operated within their design limits. The proposed rule required that the machine be positioned so that the
winch line is as near in alignment as possible with the long axis of the machine, unless the machine is designed to be
used under different conditions of alignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed the proposed provision for several reasons (Ex. 5&hyph;34). First, the commenter said that
some machines, such as cats and skidders, are designed to sustain winching strain from a much broader angle than straight
behind the machine, therefore, the proposed provision was needlessly restrictive if the machine is being operated
within its rated capacity. Second, the commenter said it was not possible to comply with the provision in many situations.
For example, the commenter said arches are normally equipped with fairleads and grapples that swing sideways out
of alignment with the long axis of the machine. Third, the commenter said the provision would create a greater hazard
when winching is conducted on very steep terrain. In such cases, the commenter said, it is more important that the machine
be positioned to assure maximum stability rather than positioning the machine relative to the log being winched.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that exact alignment is not always possible in the woods. OSHA also recognizes that a machine may have
a winch mounted on it that may work off the side or front of the machine, and that aligning the winch line with the long
axis of the machine may not be the safest manner to operate the winch.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees with this commenter that what is most important is that the design limits of the machine and winch not be
exceeded. Therefore, OSHA has revised the wording of this provision to ensure that winching operations conducted
with machines are performed within the design limitations of the machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(v) of the final rule requires that no line be moved unless the yarder operator has clearly received
and understood the signal to do so. This provision also requires that when the yarder operator is in doubt, the operator
must repeat the signal and wait for a confirming signal before moving any line. This provision has been adopted from
the proposed rule. A similar provision also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard and in various State logging
standards (Ex. 2&hyph;14, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;20, 38J). OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that adequate communication is necessary for the safe movement of trees and logs. If the yarder operator
begins moving the tree or log before the choker setter or chaser has moved to a safe location, the choker setter or chaser
could be injured if struck or caught by a yarding line, carriage, or choker, or by the tree or log. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of the final rule requires that the load shall not exceed the rated capacity of the pallet or other
carrier. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.
This provision is an outgrowth of the requirement that the rated capacity of machines shall not be exceeded. In order
to prevent machines from rollovers and tipovers, it is also essential that loads on trailers not exceed the maximum
capacity the trailer was designed to carry and the machine was designed to transport. If loads exceed the maximum capacity,
the machine operator will be at greater risk of rollover or tipover. As discussed above, a significant number of fatalities
have occurred in the logging industry due to rollover accidents. NIOSH reported that 80 logging employees were killed
in machine rollover accidents from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex. 5&hyph;42). The State of Washington reported that 12 logging
employees were killed in rollover accidents from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(vii) of the final rule requires that towed equipment must be attached to the machine or vehicle in
such a manner as to allow a 90 degree turn, to prevent overrunning of the towing machine or vehicle and to assure that
the operator is always in control of the towed equipment. Towed equipment includes but is not limited to skid pans,
pallets, arches and trailers. This provision parallels the proposed requirement. There were no comments opposing
this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's intention in this provision is two-fold. First, OSHA believes this provision is necessary to help reduce the
potential for rollover of vehicles or machines that are moving equipment to various work sites. For example, a trailer
carrying a maximum load could tip over or roll over and cause the towing machine or vehicle to roll over if the loaded
trailer cannot make a full 90 degree turn. Second, this provision is necessary to help assure that material handling
equipment is not overloaded. This provision must be viewed in conjunction with the requirement that loads must not
exceed the rated capacity of the trailer or other carrier on which it is being towed. For example, when towed equipment
exceeds the rated capacity of the towing trailer, it may overrun the towing machine or vehicle. When the rate capacity
of the trailer is exceeded there is an increased likelihood that the operator may lose control over the towed equipment
and an accident could result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(viii) of the final rule requires that each yarding machine or vehicle, including its load, must
be operated with safe clearance from all obstructions. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There
were no comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(ix) of the final rule requires that each yarded tree must be placed in a location that does not create
a hazard for an employee and be placed in an orderly manner so that the trees are stable before other work, such as bucking
or limbing, is commenced. The proposed rule required that trees yarded for bucking shall be safely located and stable
before bucking is commenced. There were no comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule, OSHA has expanded this provision to provide that no work is commenced until yarded trees are stabilized
and safely located. OSHA believes it is necessary to apply this provision to all work done in the area of yarded trees.
The WIR survey indicates that the single greatest cause of accidents in the logging industry is being injured by a tree,
log or limb and a significant number of employees were injured performing bucking and limbing (Ex. 2&hyph;1). If operations,
such as bucking or limbing, are located too close to other work operations, unsuspecting loggers could be injured
by a rolling log. Moreover, if yarded trees or stacks of trees are not stabilized, loggers performing work activities
involving these trees could be at substantial risk of injury if the unstabilized trees move, shift or roll. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSHA has not retained two proposed requirements from this paragraph. The first would have required
the examination of spar trees for defects before they are rigged. This provision has been deleted because it relates
to the construction of cable yarding systems that is not covered by the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second provision would have required unstable trees and spars to be guyed to ensure stability. Some commenters
said that requiring employees to climb on and rig unstable trees presents a greater hazard than does felling an unguyed
tree (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;21). The weight of the climber and his rigging gear could cause the tree to break off and
fall over, resulting in serious injury or death to the climber. OSHA has addressed in other ways the hazards associated
with danger trees through other practice requirements. For example, the final rule requires danger trees to be felled
or removed before any work can be commenced in the area.

Loading and Unloading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h)(6) of the final rule specifies various work practice requirements regarding loading and unloading
trees onto transport machines or vehicles. These requirements were based on those in the 1978 logging standard and
various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). OSHA believes
these work practices are necessary to protect employees from being hit by machines, vehicles, trees and logs during
loading and unloading. The WIR survey indicates that five percent of the injuries reported occurred during loading
or unloading (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State of Washington study indicated that five percent of all deaths occurred during
loading and unloading operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(i) of the final rule requires that the transport machine or vehicle be positioned to provide working
clearance between the vehicle and deck of trees or logs. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the
proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported the need for adequate room between transport equipment and trees or logs (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters pointed out that room needs to be provided on the landing for the transport
machine or vehicle and its counterweights, especially when landings are on sloped terrain. The record supports these
commenters' position. According to the State of Washington study, almost 10 percent of all deaths reported occurred
when an employee was struck by mobile equipment and five percent of all deaths involved employees performing loading
operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). OSHA believes that the employer must consider several factors in determining an adequate
work clearance for loading and unloading. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of loading machine
and transport vehicle being used, the physical characteristics of the load being moved, and the layout of the area
where the operation is being conducted. For example, if the vehicle is a self-loading log truck, it will have to be positioned
close to the deck of logs to allow the truck to be loaded. On the other hand, if a crane or other material handling machine
is used to load and unload the transport vehicle, the machine must be positioned so that it can reach both the deck of
logs and the vehicle without exceeding the rated capacity of the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of the final rule requires that only the loading or unloading machine operator and other personnel
that the employer demonstrates are essential shall be allowed in the work area during loading and unloading. This
provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. There were
no comments opposing this provision. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because, as discussed above, many
injuries and fatalities in the logging industry involve loading operations. For example, the State of Washington
study reported that three employees were killed when they were struck by logs falling from the transport vehicle during
loading (Ex. 4&hyph;129).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule, OSHA is clarifying its intention that the employer bears the burden of proving that personnel other
than the machine operator who are in the loading or unloading area are essential to that activity. OSHA notes that this
is a case-by-case determination that requires the employer to evaluate the needs and conditions present at the time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of the final rule requires that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during loading
and unloading if logs are carried or moved over the cab, unless the employer demonstrates that it is essential for the
operator to be in the cab. This provision also requires that when the transport vehicle operator remains in the cab
during loading or unloading operations, the employer must provide operator protection such as, but not limited to,
reinforcement of the cab. The proposed rule specifies that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during
loading and unloading unless the employer demonstrates that it was necessary for the operator to be in the cab. The
1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). Several commenters stated that there were so many situations in which it is essential for transport vehicle
operators to be in the cab or on the vehicle during loading and unloading that the exceptions would overwhelm the rule
(Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). For example, commenters said that self-loading
logging trucks must be operated by the driver from an elevated seat above the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36). In other
loading operations the operator is required to move the transport vehicle back and forth in the loading chute to position
the log on the load (Ex. 5&hyph;34). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that the cab may be the safest place for the transport vehicle operator to be during loading
and unloading (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;34). One commenter said that greater hazards were posed for the
operator when not in the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;34). For example, the operator outside the cab can be struck by logs that fall
off the load or come out of the jaws of the loading machine, or by the loading machine itself. This commenter pointed
out that in the State of Washington there have been numerous fatalities and serious injuries reported when the operator
was outside the cab, but none reported when the operator was in the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;34). As such, this commenter said
that many logging establishments will only permit logs to be unloaded if the transport vehicle operator is in the cab
(Ex. 5&hyph;34). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes the record shows that in some situations the safest place for the transport vehicle operator will be
in the cab (e.g., Ex. 4&hyph;129). The WIR survey appears to support this position, in that only three percent of all
injuries reported involved mobile equipment (Ex. 2&hyph;1). By contrast, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported
resulted from being hit by a tree or falling in the work site. However, there are some hazards to operators who remain
in cabs during loading and unloading. Any time logs are carried or moved over the cab, it is possible due to equipment
failure or operator error that the log could fall on the cab and seriously injure the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other standards OSHA has recognized the hazard of carrying loads over people. These standards include requirements
that material handling equipment operators avoid this practice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 29 CFR 1910.179, 29 CFR 1910.180, 29 CFR 1910.181). In many new self-loading trucks, the hoist mechanism is behind
the cab, a location which prevents the movement of logs over the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;71). In other situations, however,
logs are still moved or carried over the cab. It is not safe for the operator to be in the cab in those situations. Therefore,
when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the final rule requires that the operator not remain in the cab if the employer
has not demonstrated that it is essential for the operator to do so. If it is essential for the operator to be in the cab
when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the employer must provide protection for the operator. The final rule states
that this protection includes but is not limited to reinforcement of the cab.

Paragraph (h)(6)(iv) of the final rule requires that each log be placed on the transport vehicle in an orderly manner
and tightly secured. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. There were no comments
opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that this provision is necessary to protect employees from the hazards that result from haphazard loading
and inadequately securing the load. For example, when the load is not properly stacked and/or tightly secured, logs
can swing in the tie downs and hit an employee. In addition, the load can shift and cause both the trailer and transport
machine or vehicle to rollover. Proper stowage of vehicle loads has the added advantage of providing, in most cases,
a more compact load with a lower center of gravity, one that is safer to move. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(v) of the final rule requires that the load be positioned to prevent slippage or loss during handling
and transport. This requirement parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any
comments opposing this provision. A load that is improperly positioned can roll or shift at any time, thereby potentially
endangering any employee who might be close at hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(vi) of the final rule requires that each stake and chock used to trip loads must be constructed so
the tripping mechanism is activated on the side opposite the release of the load. OSHA has adopted this provision from
the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar provision. There were no comments opposing
this provision. OSHA believes this provision is necessary to protect employees from sudden or unexpected shifts
or movements of the logs when a load is released. Only by keeping employees out of the potential paths of the shifting
or moving logs can there be assurance that the employee will not be struck by a log. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(vii) of the final rule requires that each tie down be left in place over the peak log to secure the logs
until the unloading lines or other equivalent protection have been put in place. This provision also specifies that
a stake of sufficient strength to withstand forces of shifting logs shall be considered to provide protection equivalent
to a tie down, provided that the logs are not loaded higher than the stake. This provision parallels the requirement
contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The West Virginia Forestry Association supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;54). They said that several recent
serious logging accidents had occurred in their state because logs loaded too high have fallen off the transport vehicle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the vibration of the load during transport, the load can shift or move so that when the restraints are removed,
the load will roll or otherwise fall off the truck, thereby endangering the employee who must remove the restraints.
For this reason, OSHA has specified the necessary and appropriate work practices that must be followed to ensure the
safe unloading of transport vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(viii) of the final rule requires that each tie down be released only from the side on which the unloading
machine operates. This provision also permits two exceptions to this requirement in situations when the tie down
is released by a remote control device and when the employee making the release is protected by racks, stanchions or
other protection the employer demonstrates is capable of withstanding the force of moving and shifting logs. This
requirement parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the exceptions to the release requirement be eliminated (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). However, these commenters did not provide any discussion to support their position.
OSHA believes that adequate protection is provided in the alternate releasing methods that are excepted from this
provision to protect the machine or vehicle operator from being hit by moving or shifting trees or logs.

Paragraph (h)(7) of the final rule requires the transport vehicle operator to assure that each tie down is tight before
transporting the load. In addition, this paragraph requires that while en route, the operator shall check and tighten
tie downs whenever there is reason to believe that the tie downs have loosened or the load has shifted. The proposed
rule also contained a provision requiring the transport operator to assure that tie downs have been tightened and
to check and tighten the tie downs as necessary while en route. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a provision
similar to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed the provision, believing that the provision required transport vehicle operators to implement
a regular schedule of stopping and checking on tie downs, regardless of whether there is reason to suspect they are
loose (Ex. 5&hyph;35). OSHA has more clearly stated its original intention in the final that the operator must check
tie downs whenever there is reason to believe they are loose or the load has shifted. For example, this would occur if
an operator can feel the load shift, or knows that the transport vehicle has hit an object or pothole which jarred the
load. OSHA believes this work practice is necessary to protect the transport vehicle operator from having an accident
due to logs shifting or breaking the tie downs. In addition, this provision is necessary to protect the transport vehicle
operator from being hit by shifting or moving trees when he unloads the vehicle.

Paragraph (h)(8) of the final rule requires that each deck of logs be stacked and located so it is stable and provides
each employee with enough room to safely move and work in the area. This provision has been adopted from the proposal.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision combines two different requirements. First, this paragraph requires that decks and piles of logs
be constructed so they are stable. OSHA believes that decks must be carefully stacked so logs do not shift, roll or fall
off the deck and strike an employee who may be working or passing through the storage area. Second, this paragraph requires
that the work activities in the vicinity of the storage are well-planned so enough room is provided for those work activities
so that an employee is not harmed if the stacked logs shift, roll or fall. OSHA believes these work practices are necessary
to protect employees working in the landing area. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent of injuries reported involved
accidents at landing areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (i) of the final rule OSHA has specified various training requirements. For several reasons OSHA believes
training is a critical element in a integrated control program to reduce the number of accidents, and consequently,
the number of fatalities and injuries in the logging industry. First, the logging industry is a high hazard industry.
Employees need to be made aware of the various hazards so they can actively participate in making the workplace safe.
According to the WIR survey, 10 percent of the workers who reported injuries said that being unaware of the hazard had
contributed to their accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, training is also essential in achieving compliance with the substantive requirements of the standard, including
the use of personal protective equipment and safe work practices. Without effective training, employees may not
be aware of how to perform their job safely or how the integrated controls can reduce injuries and fatalities. Third,
training is especially important in complying with the logging standard because the standard relies heavily on safe
work practices to prevent accidents from occurring. Employees who are not trained in how to perform their job safely
can put themselves and other employees at risk of injury. Various studies of accidents in the logging industry indicate
that poor work practices are a major contributing factor (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 4&hyph;3, 4&hyph;14, 4&hyph;15, 4&hyph;61,
4&hyph;63, 4&hyph;121, 4&hyph;125, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;138, 4&hyph;172, 5&hyph;20). For example, according
to an accident study conducted by one commenter, 40 percent of accidents were due to poor planning, 40 percent were
due to poor technique, and 15 to 18 percent were due to carelessness (Ex. 5&hyph;20). Only 2 to 5 percent of the accidents
were due to equipment failure. The WIR survey indicated that poor work practices of employees or a co-worker were a
contributing factor in more than one-half of all accidents reported (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA's FCI report indicated
that unsafe work practices and misjudgments accounted for 42 percent of logging employees who were killed (Ex. 4&hyph;61).

Fourth, training is necessary to correct unsafe behavior before it results in injury to the employee or others. In
the WIR survey, injured loggers reported that among the factors that contributed to the accident were coworker's
activity, misjudging time and distance needed to avoid injury, using wrong cutting methods and not paying full attention
to work. In addition, a State of Washington study of fatalities in the logging industry from 1977&hyph;83 concluded
that over 90 percent of the deaths had been preventable (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Therefore, when unsafe behavior is observed,
it is important that proper work practices be reinforced through additional training. Fifth, according to the WIR
survey, more than one third of all those injured had never received training. Moreover, more than one half of injured
loggers working in non-western States (i.e., States without logging standards and training requirements) had never
received training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixth, the logging industry itself supports the value of training in reducing accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;181, 5&hyph;6,
5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;45,
5&hyph;47, 5&hyph;59, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). Many commenters said their accident rates decreased
after they implemented a training program (Ex. 5&hyph;33, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). One company achieved
a 63-percent reduction in lost workdays within a year of implementing training (Tr. W2 125). The Montana Logging Association
reported that member companies had decreased accidents by 52 percent after implementing training (Tr. OR 566). A
study for the International Woodworkers of America found a 71-percent reduction in accidents in establishments
in the Pacific Northwest region who had implemented training programs (Ex. 4&hyph;181). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(1) requires that training be provided for each employee, including supervisors, at no cost to the employee.
The proposed rule also required each employee to be trained. This provision clarifies OSHA's intent that supervisors
also must receive training. OSHA believes that it is important that supervisors be trained since they are responsible
for making work assignments, determining work areas, providing consultation when hazardous situations arise,
determining when new employees can begin to work independently, and identifying and correcting unsafe job performance
of employees they supervise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised the issue of cost and availability of training programs, especially for small establishments
(Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;51). However, other commenters said there are training resources that are readily
available for logging establishments (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69, 36, 9&hyph;1). These include
logging associations and companies which currently offer logging training programs and traveling training seminars,
and video tapes which are available to employers. For example, the Alaska Timber Insurance Exchange has established
a video library for policyholders to use as training supplements (Ex. 9&hyph;15). The American Pulpwood Association
said it was developing a logging training that was to be available by the end of 1989 (Ex. 5&hyph;27). The Associated
Oregon Loggers has also developed logging training programs for member companies (Ex. 36). One training company
indicated it was currently providing a variety of different logging training programs in six different States (Ex.
5&hyph;20). OSHA also notes that several commenters have expressed their willingness to work with OSHA to train loggers
(Ex. 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;47, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(2) requires that training be provided as follows: as soon as possible but not later than the effective
date of this section for initial training of each current employee who has not previously received training; prior
to initial assignment for each new employee who has not previously received training; whenever an employee is assigned
new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles; and whenever an employee demonstrates unsafe job performance.
When the proposed rule did not require initial training for each current employee, the proposed rule would have required
training prior to initial assignment; annual retraining of each employee; and retraining whenever changes in job
assignment would expose the employee to new or additional hazards. OSHA received many comments on the training provisions,
some of which have already been discussed above in the Major Issues section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters raised the issue of whether experienced and/or previously trained employees would be required to
be retrained (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;49,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). Some commenters favored training of all workers, regardless
of their previous employment experience (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35). Other commenters said
that previously trained or experienced workers should be excepted from training requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36,
5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA believes that employees who have never received training must
be trained, regardless of their level of experience. The need to provide training for experienced loggers who have
not previously received such training is supported by the WIR survey, that indicates that over one third of those injured
had never received training and 56 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for 5 years or more. By
contrast, only 22 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. In addition, the
WIR survey indicates that the employees who were injured performed the activity in which they were injured on almost
a daily basis. (OSHA is allowing an exception to initial training for previously trained employees. See discussion
of paragraph (i)(5)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also received several comments on annual retraining of employees. Some commenters said annual retraining is
necessary (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;43, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;20). One commenter said that machine
operators should be retrained at least annually (Ex. 5&hyph;34). However, other commenters questioned the need
for annual retraining of loggers and suggested that retraining could be handled in regular safety and health meetings
(Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;43). One commenter also said retraining should be limited to an ``as needed basis''
(Ex. 5&hyph;19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has addressed these concerns in the final rule. Instead of an annual retraining provision, the final rule contains
provisions requiring employers to hold safety and health meetings at least once a month (paragraph (i)(11)), and
to retrain any employee who demonstrates unsafe job performance. OSHA agrees with the commenters that these new provisions
are more responsive to addressing new hazards and unsafe job performance than is an annual retraining requirement.
These provisions also require the employer to address unsafe job performance immediately. These provisions require
the employer to address new hazards as they appear in the workplace in monthly safety and health meetings. In addition
to being more responsive to hazards as they appear in the workplace, OSHA believes these provisions will be less burdensome
on employers, especially small employers with limited resources. OSHA anticipates that only a portion of employees
will need to be retrained due to unsafe job performance. Also OSHA believes that for many employers ongoing monthly
safety and health meetings will be incorporated into job planning meetings that are well-established in the logging
industry. (Safety and health meetings are addressed further in discussion of paragraph (i)(11)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received comments supporting the need for training of new inexperienced employees and training employees assigned
to new job tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28). There were no comments
opposing these provisions, therefore, OSHA has retained these requirements in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has added the requirement of retraining of employees demonstrating unsafe job performance based on practice
in the industry. OSHA received comment that some employers who are providing training do require retraining where
unsafe job performance is identified (Ex. 29). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also contained minimum training elements that included recognition of safety hazards associated
with the employee's particular work tasks and the protective and preventive measures to deal with those hazards;
recognition and prevention of general safety hazards in the logging industry; and safe use and maintenance of any
machine, equipment or tool used by an employee. One commenter agreed that training should list the hazards of each
step of an employee's job and describe how these particular hazards could be controlled (Ex. 5&hyph;17). There were
no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSHA has added the requirement that employees be trained in the procedures, practices and requirements
of the employer's work site in recognition of the number of comments who describe the logging industry as highly transient
(Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). While new employees may be experienced and well-trained in the recognition
of hazards of the job and in the safe use of equipment of the trade, they may be unaware of the operating protocol of a particular
establishment, such as how work activities are organized, or what system of signals is being used. OSHA has also added
a provision in the final rule requiring that each employee be trained in the requirements of this section. OSHA believes
it is important that employees know the various provisions of this section so they can actively participate in contributing
to their own protection. This provision is included in other OSHA standards (e.g., 29 CFR 1910.132, 29 CFR 1910.146,
29 CFR 1910.1047). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(4) of the final rule permits the employer to limit training of an employee due to unsafe job performance
and for any employee assigned to new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles to those content elements
in paragraph (i)(3) that are relevant to the circumstances giving rise to the need for training. The proposed rule
did not contain a similar provision. OSHA has added this provision to reduce the burden of the training requirement
by allowing employers to focus the additional training on the elements necessary to prepare the employee to safely
perform the job or operate a new piece of equipment. For example, OSHA is aware that an employee who is assigned to operate
a new machine, may not need retraining in recognition of general hazards in the logging industry or the requirements
of the logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (i)(5) of the final rule OSHA establishes certain exceptions to the training requirement. Current and
new employees who have received training previously do not need to be retrained in those elements of paragraph (i)(3)
for which they have received training. This paragraph also reinforces that each current and new employee must still
receive training in those elements for which they have not previously been trained. Even though certain limited exceptions
to the training requirements are allowed, this paragraph reinforces that the employer is responsible for ensuring
that each current and new employee can properly and safely perform the work tasks and operate the tools, equipment,
machines and vehicles used in their job. The proposed rule would have required new employees to be trained, regardless
of whether they were experienced or had been trained previously, before initial assignment. The proposed standard
also would have required each new and current employee to receive annual retraining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were confused about who was required to be trained under the proposed rule and many commenters
opposed retraining of previously trained workers (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43,
5&hyph;53; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). According to these commenters, employees move from employer to employer and requiring
retraining of each new employee would be both duplicative and costly. As discussed above in the Major Issues section,
OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns by allowing previous training to be acceptable in lieu of new initial
training for both current and new employees. In order to determine whether the training exception is applicable to
a particular employee, the employer must first ascertain whether previous training has satisfied the training content
requirements of paragraph (i)(3). Determining whether previous training meets the requirements of this section
should not be difficult with regard to current employees. Employers can examine their training materials to ensure
that each of the training content requirements has already been covered in training sessions. OSHA notes that each
current and new employee will at least have to be trained in the requirements of this new standard. OSHA believes that
many employers will provide training on the new final rule in the monthly safety and health meetings

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It may, however, require additional effort for the employer to determine whether a new employee has received training
that meets the requirements of the final rule. An employer cannot merely ask the new employee whether he has been trained.
Rather, under the training certification requirements of this paragraph (see paragraph (i)(10)), the employer
must make a determination of whether and when the past training was adequate to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether past training was adequate, the employer will have to go through two steps. First, the employer
must inquire whether the new employee had training in each of the elements specified in paragraph (i)(3). When the
new employee indicates that he has not received training in a particular element, the employer will need to provide
training in that element. Second, when the employee indicates that he had received training in each of the required
elements, the employer must then determine whether the particular training was adequate. Most likely, the employer
will make that determination while the new employee is working under close supervision of a designated person, as
required by this paragraph. When the new employee, who has been previously trained, can demonstrate the ability to
safely perform the job independently, the employee can then determine and certify that previous training had been
adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (i)(6) of the final rule, OSHA requires that each new employee and each employee who is required to be trained
by this paragraph, to work under the close supervision of a designated person until the employee is able to demonstrate
the ability to safely perform the new job independently. The proposed rule contained two provisions specifying initial
close supervision. One provision specified initial close supervision for all power tool and machine operators and
associated maintenance personnel. The second provided initial close supervision for each new employee, and each
newly trained employee. In addition, the State of Oregon logging standard requires initial close supervision for
new employees and requires experienced new employees to demonstrate their competence before being allowed to perform
the job independently (Ex. 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55,
5&hyph;63, 9&hyph;9; Tr. W1 91&hyph;92, 172&hyph;73, OR 151&hyph;52, 216, 373, 377, 410). NIOSH said it was important
in the logging industry to have an adequate balance of classroom and on-the-job training (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH said
working with a designated person would be especially effective for pointing out poisonous plants to inexperienced
workers (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Several commenters also supported limiting this provision to only inexperienced workers
(Ex. 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has carefully considered the comments and has decided for several reasons that it is necessary in the final rule
to retain the requirement that each new and each newly-trained employee work under the close supervision of a designated
person initially. There are several reasons for this determination. First, this requirement acts as a final check
on the competency of a newly-trained employee by allowing the employer to measure in practical terms how well the employee
has absorbed the training. Second, this provision is also a measure of the general effectiveness and adequacy of the
employer's training program. When employees are not able to demonstrate the ability to perform the job safely, the
employer needs to review and correct the training program and retrain the workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA believes this provision is essential given the inclusion of an initial training exception in the final
rule for previously trained workers. As discussed earlier, more than 60 percent of all loggers who reported injuries
in the WIR survey had been previously trained (Ex. 2&hyph;1). This data supports the need for safeguards to integrating
new employees into the workplace if initial training of each new employee is not required. Finally, this provision
is also a safeguard for integrating newly-trained employees and employees whose unsafe job performance has necessitated
retraining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(7) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding first-aid training for each employee,
including supervisors. Paragraph (i)(7)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee
receives or has received first-aid and CPR training. This provision also requires that first-aid training meet at
least the requirements of Appendix B. The proposed rule would have required only supervisors, fellers and at least
one additional person in each operating area to have first-aid training. The proposed rule also would have required
that the first-aid training content meet the training programs of the American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA) or other equivalent program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is expanding the requirement on first-aid training to all employees.
According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at cutting sites, that in most cases are remote
from medical facilities and personnel (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Also as discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is
not requiring employers to provide the first-aid training. The employer can meet the requirements of the standard
by assuring that employees he hires already have taken first-aid training. The employer can also meet this requirement
by requiring any worker in his employ to take a first-aid training course from any organization in the community whose
program meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, the standard does not require repeat first-aid training
for workers who have received first-aid training previously, provided the training has met the content requirements
of this standard and their first-aid certificate is current. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to first-aid training content, Appendix B specifies the minimum content of required first-aid training.
This content list includes training in emergency situations that are most likely to arise in the logging industry,
such as control of bleeding and shock, immobilization of injured persons, treatment of sprains and fractures, and
treatment of contact with poisonous plants or animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several reasons, in the final rule, OSHA has specified the minimum first-aid training requirements rather than
simply referring to programs provided by various organizations. First, the content list is in keeping with OSHA's
goal of developing performance language standards. Second, the content list in Appendix B focuses on the types of
situations that are most likely to occur in the logging industry and in remote work sites. General first-aid training
programs may not thoroughly cover the kinds of situations found in the logging industry. Third, the content of training
programs offered by various organizations may change and an element crucial to first aid in remote outdoor locations
may be dropped. By specifying the minimum content, the standard places training organizations on notice as to what
elements their program must include in order to meet the requirements of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, by expressing the first-aid training requirements in performance language, OSHA is providing employers
with maximum flexibility. Employers will not have to research the Red Cross and MSHA training programs to see if a training
program offered locally by another organization meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, by specifying
the content, the standard leaves employers free to develop their own first-aid training program or rely on outside
organizations to provide first aid training. Fifth, since the final standard permits employers to require their
employees to take first-aid training rather than providing the training, it is important to provide employees with
an understandable criteria for determining whether the training program they select meets the requirements of this
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(7)(ii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee receives first-aid training
at least every three years and receives CPR training at least annually. The proposed rule did not contain a similar
requirement. Most first-aid training organizations require retraining at the above frequency in order to maintain
a current certificate (Ex. 5&hyph;42). OSHA agrees with these organizations that it is necessary to refresh one's
first-aid skills on a regular basis. Since these skills are not usually used on a daily basis, trained persons may become
less able to render these skills over time without periodic refresher training. In addition, what constitutes the
best first-aid techniques and procedures changes over time. Employees need to be retrained so their skills include
the best and most current practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(7)(iii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee's first aid and CPR training
and/or certificate of training remain current. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. OSHA believes
this provision is essential given the inclusion of the exception in the final rule for previously trained workers.
In addition, it is essential because employers can comply with the first-aid training provisions without actually
providing the training themselves. In essence, this provision is similar to the provision in paragraph (i)(5) reinforcing
that the employer is responsible for assuring that the employee can safely perform the job, even if the employer has
not been required to actually provide the training. Regardless of whether the employer provides training or allows
employees to take a first-aid program offered by another organization, the employer is still responsible for assuring
that employees can render first aid properly if called upon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (i)(8) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that training be conducted by a designated person. As discussed
above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform the
specific duties. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters said that it was important that training be conducted by a qualified or certified person (Ex. 9&hyph;3,
9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;16). OSHA has included this provision in the final rule because the Agency wants to assure that
regardless of whether employers rely on their own personnel to conduct training or utilize outside experts, the person
providing training must have the necessary qualifications and background in the subject matter being taught. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(9) of the final rule requires that training required by this section be presented in a manner that the
employee is able to understand. This provision also requires that the employer assure that training materials are
appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level, literacy and language skills of the employees being
trained. A similar provision was not contained in the proposed rule. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule
as a way of ensuring that all employees, regardless of their cultural or educational background, will receive adequate
training on how to perform their job safely. OSHA notes that this requirement applies to both logging and first-aid
training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(10) requires the certification of training. While this provision was not contained in the proposed
rule, several commenters stressed the need to document training (Ex. 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;18; Tr. OR 137, 558&hyph;59,
643&hyph;44). OSHA agrees with these commenters that documenting training is necessary. First, in the final rule
OSHA has allowed prior training to be acceptable in lieu of initial training. In the proposed rule, OSHA had required
that each new employee, regardless of experience and prior training, receive training prior to initial assignment.
In order to accept prior training in lieu of new training, OSHA believes employers must establish a process for determining
whether the prior training was adequate. The certification procedure provides that process without imposing a significant
burden. Second, several commenters said that many establishments do not currently document training (Tr. W1 95,
OR 92). As such, employers do not have any records to indicate whether appropriate training has been provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, some commenters testified that all training programs should be written programs (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;42).
While many large logging establishments already have implemented impressive written training programs, OSHA is
also aware that a written training and recordkeeping requirement would impose a paperwork burden and significant
burden on small employers in this industry (Ex. 5&hyph;44). OSHA believes that training certification is a less burdensome
way of documenting whether employees have been adequately trained. OSHA notes that the time and costs of training
certification have been included in the final regulatory impact analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(10)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer verify compliance with paragraph (i) of this section
by preparing a written certification record. This provision also requires that the written certification record
contain the name or other identity of the employee trained, the date(s) of the training, and the signature of the person
who conducted the training or the signature of the employer. In addition, this provision requires that if the employer
relies on training conducted prior to the employee being hired or prior to the effective date of this section, the certification
record shall indicate the date the employer determined the prior training was adequate rather than the date of actual
training. The proposed rule did not contain a certification requirement.

The Agency is adding this new provision to the final rule in large part because it is allowing prior training to be accepted
in place of a new round of training. OSHA recognizes, given the transient nature of the workforce in this industry,
that in many cases an employer will be unable to identify the date on which previous training was provided by another
employer. In those cases, OSHA believes that knowing the date of the prior training is not as important as the employer's
determination as to whether the prior training is adequate. As such, OSHA is requiring employers to certify on what
date they determine the prior training to be adequate. In the final rule OSHA has included a measurable way to determine
when and whether prior training had been adequate. The final rule requires that each new employee work under close
supervision of a designated person until the employee demonstrates the ability to safely perform the job independently.
In most cases, therefore, this demonstration date will constitute the certification date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that the most recent training certification be maintained. This
provision has been included to limit the number of records that the employer is required to maintain on training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(11) of the final rule requires that the employer hold safety and health meetings as necessary and at
least each month for each employee. This provision allows safety and health meetings to be conducted individually,
in crew meetings, in larger groups, or as part of other staff meetings. The proposed rule did not contain a safety and
health meeting requirement. Many State logging standards also require regular safety and health meetings in the
logging industry (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 36, 38K). For example, the State of Washington logging standard
requires safety meetings to be held monthly and whenever work is started at a new work site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the need for regular and ongoing safety and health meetings for both inexperienced and
experienced workers (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28; Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, OR 92, 110, 137, 197, 204, 276,
335, 374, 643&hyph;44, 691&hyph;92). Several of these commenters indicated that many establishments in the industry
already hold safety and health meetings on a regular basis. Several commenters said safety and health meetings were
an effective way of informing employees about hazards and keeping their safety awareness high (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28;
Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, 189&hyph;90, OR 92, 110, 137, 204, 276, 374, 643&hyph;44). One commenter said that documented
monthly safety and health meetings were necessary on all logging operations ``to instill the necessary safe work
attitude in all logging employees'' (Ex. 5&hyph;28). Commenters also said safety and health meetings were good for
providing targeted information (Tr. W1 94, 164, 189, OR 110, 204&hyph;05, 373, 643). For example, they said safety
and health meetings were a way of informing employees about recent accidents and about lapses in safe work practices,
and to alert employees about conditions and hazards peculiar to the job to be performed or the site to be logged that
day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also said that safety and health meetings were necessary for both inexperienced and experienced loggers
(Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;45; Tr. OR 335). One of these commenters said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We don't feel that just new employees or green men ought to be sitting in safety and health meetings. Repetition increases
retention, and everyone can benefit if they've heard it a hundred times. Maybe they forgot it 99 [times] and it might
save their life or their buddy's life the next day (Tr. OR 335).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees with these commenters that safety and health meetings are necessary to reinforce proper work practices
and to alert employees to particular hazards which are present in the workplace. OSHA believes that regular safety
and health meetings will provide adequate retraining for employees in the logging industry, and that these meetings
are necessary in lieu of requiring annual retraining of experienced workers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in paragraph (j), this final rule becomes effective 120 days after publication of the revised rule and preamble
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Employers must be in compliance with all requirements of this section by the effective date. One commenter recommended
a three-year delay in the effective date of this final rule to allow for manufacturers' design and lead time and retrofitting
of old equipment (Ex. 5&hyph;22). OSHA believes that 120 days is a reasonable compliance time for this standard for
several reasons. First, the Agency is not requiring retrofitting ROPS and FOPS on old machines or chain brakes on chain
saws. Those equipment requirements apply only to machines and chain saws placed into initial service after the effective
date. OSHA believes that replacement of safety devices that have been removed, such as seat belts, should not require
additional compliance time. Second, in the final rule OSHA has not adopted any equipment requirements that are not
already standard safety features of equipment currently manufactured and readily available. Therefore, additional
compliance time is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OSHA believes that allowing 120 days for employers to come into compliance will provide employers with adequate
time to familiarize themselves with the final rule, to purchase needed equipment, and to develop and conduct required
training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the revision of the existing pulpwood logging standard, 29 CFR 1910.266, is to protect all loggers from
the hazards encountered during timber harvesting regardless of the end use of the wood. Hazards are present, for example,
due to falling, rolling or sliding trees and logs, the use of hazardous equipment such as chain saws, and improper work
practices. According to BLS, these hazards resulted in an accident incidence rate of 15.6 injuries per 100 full-time
workers in 1991, which is nearly twice the incidence rate of 7.9 injuries per 100 full-time workers for overall private
sector. The number of lost workdays in logging in 1991 was 274.8 per 100 full-time workers, which is about three times
that of manufacturing and four times that of the overall private sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing logging standard applies only to the logging of wood that is used to make pulp for paper and paperboard.
Other logging operations are not covered by the existing standard. However, other general industry safety and health
standards in Part 1910, such as but not limited to, Occupational Noise Exposure (29 CFR 1910.95), Lockout/Tagout
(29 CFR 1910.147), and Personal Protective Equipment (29 CFR Subpart I), apply to non-pulpwood logging operations,
as well as the General Duty clause of the OSH Act (Section 5(a)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule expands the coverage of the pulpwood logging standard to include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 logging operations, regardless of the end use of the wood. Many of the provisions in the pulpwood logging standard
have been retained in this standard. Some provisions have been modified, such as those requiring safety and first-aid
training for all employees, and personal protective equipment. In certain cases, work practices have been made more
specific.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that six State Plan States (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington) have
developed logging standards that cover all logging operations and are not limited to just pulpwood logging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) has been prepared by OSHA in compliance with Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The analysis was developed based on information and comments
in the OSHA logging docket and informal public hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Affected Industries and Workers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of analysis, logging operations in the United States were divided in four relevant geographical regions_the
North, the South, the Rocky Mountains, and the Pacific Coast. The leading States in logging employment in 1987 were
Oregon, Washington, Alabama and Georgia, which accounted for 40 percent of logging employment. The final rule will
affect approximately 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations covered by the final rule and 11,936 logging
establishments. Almost 94 percent of all logging establishments employ fewer than 20 employees and 60 percent of
all logging employees work in small establishments. These estimates do not include independent contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affected workers include, but are not limited to, fellers and buckers, who cut the trees; skidder and yarder operators,
choker setters, and chasers, who are responsible for delivering a felled tree to the landing; and loader operators
and truck drivers, who load the trees onto trucks for transport to a mill. Although all stages of logging present hazards
to workers, the loggers most at risk are manual felling crews rather than those who operate mechanical harvesting
equipment and are protected by enclosed cabs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Technological Feasibility Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The work practice and training provisions as well as the requirements regarding personal protective equipment and
equipment protective devices in the final rule are technologically feasible. The fact that the requirements of the
standard already are being achieved in the logging industry is the best evidence of feasibility. The record shows
that many logging establishments are currently providing the training, equipment protection devices and personal
protective equipment that would meet the requirements of the new standard. In addition, the record also shows they
are operating under the same work practices as those required by the standard. Based on the record, OSHA has determined
that numerous logging establishments of all sizes are already in compliance with most of the provisions of the final
standard. In addition, equipment protective devices and personal protective equipment which are required by the
final rule are all commercially available. Therefore, OSHA has determined that the final rule is technologically
feasible.

D. Costs of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA estimated compliance costs using data in the record on current practices and exposed population, including
a report prepared by Centaur Associates, Inc. (Ex. 3). Based on all the data and evidence in the record, OSHA estimates
that first-year costs associated with compliance will be $14.3 million. Total annualized cost of compliance with
the standard is estimated to be $12.5 million. Table 22 shows the summary of costs of compliance with the final rule.

Of the total annualized cost, 43 percent is attributable to inspection and maintenance of logging equipment. Training
costs, which include safety and first-aid training as well as monthly safety and health meetings, account for 32 percent.
Personal protective equipment accounts for about 21 percent of total annual costs. First-aid kits for 1.9 percent.
Replacement of operator manuals or instructions accounts for 1.5 percent and replacement of seat belts removed from
machines and vehicles accounts for about 0.6 percent of total costs.

D. Benefits of the Revised Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record shows that injury rates in the logging industry are high. In 1991, there were 15.6 injuries per 100 workers
in the logging industry as compared to an injury incidence rate of 7.9 and 11.2 per 100 workers in the private industry
and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Lost workday rates are especially high in the logging industry, indicating
that most logging accidents are serious. Based on the data in the record, OSHA estimates that there are approximately
158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries annually in the logging industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised standard mandates a variety of methods of control to reduce hazards in the logging industry. Included
in the standard are provisions for personal protective equipment, machine protective devices, equipment inspection
and maintenance, work practices, and training. The revised standard is expected to significantly reduce the number
of accidents, and, consequently, fatalities and injuries that occur in the logging industry. The ability of the revised
standard to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities depends largely on this integrated program of controls to
deal with the range of hazards that exist in logging operations. For this reason, the effects of the overall standard
on workplace safety is expected to be greater than the effects of the elements of the standard when considered individually.
OSHA estimates that compliance with the final standard will prevent 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday cases, and
2,639 nonlost workday cases annually (Table 23). These estimates were developed based on the comprehensiveness
of the standard in dealing with the range of workplace hazards in logging.

F. Economic Feasibility Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The projected economic impact of the final standard on the logging industry is small. The cost of full compliance with
the standard represents only 0.1 percent of the value of shipments for this industry as a whole. Although these annual
costs of compliance represent a relatively insignificant amount of total shipments, some firms will bear more costs
than others depending on their existing compliance with the various provisions of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual cost of compliance per logging establishment ranges from about $38 in California where firms are at a high
level of compliance with their own State logging standard, to an average of $1,300 per establishment in the South where
no comprehensive logging standards exists. These annual costs per establishment are insignificant when viewed
in terms of other costs incurred by logging employers. It is expected that the costs of compliance with the final rule
are too small to have a significant effect on price, employment, production, or profit rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of compliance with the final rule is expected to fall primarily on small businesses, because the vast majority
of logging establishments employ fewer than 20 workers. The record shows that most large logging establishments
are already in compliance with many of the provisions of the final rule. However, many small firms are also located
in States that have comprehensive logging standards. These firms are currently in compliance with these standards
and are able to operate while incurring these costs. Even if it is assumed that small firms will bear all the costs of
compliance with the final rule, the economic impact is still small. OSHA estimates that the average cost per small
firm is substantially less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments per firm and will be more than offset
by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from fewer injuries. Even small establishments
that operate on less than a full-time basis could incur the costs of compliance without experiencing an economic disruption
that would threaten the competitive structure of the industry or cause any dislocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these estimates developed from data and evidence in the record, OSHA has concluded that the economic impact
of the standard would not threaten the stability or profitability of the logging industry. In addition, neither the
Gross National Product (GNP), the level of international trade, the price of consumer goods, nor the level of employment
would be significantly affected.

G. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Assistant Secretary has made a preliminary assessment of
the impact of the rule on small entities. As discussed above, the estimated compliance costs for small firms (i.e,
those employing fewer than 20 workers) are estimated to be less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments
per firm and will be more than offset by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from reduction
in logging accidents. As is the case for compliance costs for all firms covered under the standard, the costs of compliance
for small firms would be very small compared with net income. Therefore, OSHA does not anticipate the final rule will
have a significant impact on small firms.

H. Environmental Impact Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revisions to the standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR 1500), and the Department of Labor (DOL)
NEPA Procedures (29 CFR 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined that the rule will have no significant environmental
impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions focus on training, work practices, personal protective equipment, and protective devices on equipment
in order to reduce worker fatalities and injuries. In general, these provisions do not impact on air, water, or soil
quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, or other aspects of the environment. The revisions are considered excluded
actions under Subpart B, Section 11.10 of the DOL NEPA regulations.

VIII. Statutory Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has described the hazards confronted by employees who work in the logging industry and the measures required
to protect affected employees from those hazards in Section I, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and Section III,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary and Explanation of the Standard, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
respectively, earlier in this preamble. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate
for OSHA rulemaking activity to explain the legal basis for its determination that the logging operations standard,
as promulgated, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational
safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides
that ``[e]ach employer shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act''
(emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) provides that ``the term `occupational safety and
health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means,
methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment
and places of employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In

938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In

866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion.

OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing
courts must defer. (See for example,

448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought from
OSHA more clarification on the agency's view of the scope of those parameters. In light of those decisions, OSHA believes
it would be useful to include in the preamble to this safety standard a statement of its view of the limits of its safety
rulemaking authority and to explain why it is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory
extremes and continue to do so in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) The proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule within their parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Congress Concluded That OSHA Regulations Are Necessary To Protect Workers From Occupational Hazards and That
Employers Should Be Required To Reduce or Eliminate Significant Workplace Health and Safety Threats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury
and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising
out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost
production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared
``it to be its purpose and policy *&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation
safe *&blank;*&blank;* working conditions [29 U.S.C. 651(b)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing federal and consensus standards during
the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C. 655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)], based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe *&blank;*&blank;* employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or
health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule
as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].''
Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees
employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C. 654(a)].''

When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate
and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease,
over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated
to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation
and medical expenses. *&blank;*&blank;*

Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience when inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly
smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless
all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats.

); emphasis was supplied in original].'' When, as frequently happens in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards
that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate
the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus
and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's
inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a
result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not
at least lessen risk in a significant way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized

By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility
begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for
example, ATMI, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27,360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 &mu;g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise
serious possibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring
reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 &mu;g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving
and that 750 &mu;g/m3 was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29,245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); American
Iron &amp; Steel Institute, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised the engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous
foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole
could have survived the loss of small firms. Although the cotton dust and lead rulemakings involved health standards,
the economic feasibility ceiling established therein applies equally to safety standards. Indeed, because feasibility
is a necessary element of a ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' standard, this ceiling boundary is the same for
health and safety rulemaking since it comes from section 3(8), which governs all permanent OSHA standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (ATMI, at 514 n. 32;

838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See

453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions that a safety standard substantially reduces a significant risk
of harm, is both technologically and economically feasible, and is cost effective, OSHA must conduct rulemaking
in accord with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The regulatory proceeding allows it to determine the qualitative
and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with and without regulation, the technological feasibility
of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other
purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the
impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See

generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must
support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts
have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See

OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which

OSHA safety rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially
reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable
of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these
parameters, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all
meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes.

Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.

all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA
set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised
PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling
objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards
subject to section 6(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part:

diseases and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition
of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational
safety.

the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been

Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities
and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards
were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how
to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example,

of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
`health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in Section III, Basis for Agency Action, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and Section
VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, of this preamble, OSHA
has determined that logging operations pose significant risks to employees (158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday
injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries each year). The Agency estimates that compliance with the logging operations
standard will cost $12.8 million annually and will reduce the risk of the hazards encountered during logging operations
(i.e., 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday injuries, and 2,639 nonlost workday injuries). This constitutes a substantial
reduction of significant risk of material harm to the 72,100 logging industry employees affected. The Agency believes
that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates that the hazard control measures
required by the standard have already been implemented, to some extent, for all the logging operations covered by
the standard. Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented by
the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs and economic
benefits will exceed compliance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As detailed in Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and in Section VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory
Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements
are reasonable and consistent with those of other OSHA safety standards, such as PPE ($52.4 million annual cost of
compliance and will prevent 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually) and Grain Handling ($5.9 to 33.4 million
annual cost of compliance and will prevent 18 fatalities and 394 injuries annually) (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), regarding
Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options,
consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only
when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for
preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is
to be limited to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State
laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.
Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development
of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States
must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment
as the Federal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The logging standard is drafted so that loggers in every State would be protected by general, performance-oriented
standards. To the extent that there are State or regional peculiarities caused by the types of timber to be logged,
the terrain, the climate or other factors, States with occupational safety and health plans approved under Section
18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems. Moreover, the
performance nature of this proposed standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States and loggers to provide
as much safety as possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in the logging industry. While
the individual States, if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved, most have
not elected to do so in the twenty-four years since the enactment of the OSH Act. Those States which have elected to participate
under Section 18 of the OSH Act would not be preempted by this standard and would be able to deal with special, local conditions
within the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards are at
least as effective as the Federal standard. State comments are invited on this proposal and will be fully considered
prior to promulgation of a final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is adopting regulations to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act of 1975 (HMTA) as amended by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA). The regulations
include Federal standards and procedures which the States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain,
or enforce routing designations that (1) specify highway routes over which placarded non-radioactive hazardous
materials (NRHM) may and may not be transported within their jurisdictions, and/or (2) impose limitations or requirements
with respect to highway routing of such hazardous materials. Included are amendments to the procedures in 49 CFR part
397, subpart E, relating to Federal preemption and waivers of preemption, and new procedures for the resolution of
disputes involving State or Indian tribe NRHM routing designations. States and Indian tribes are also required to
furnish updated NRHM route information for publication by the FHWA. The existing motor carrier regulations with
NRHM routing requirements have been incorporated into this regulation, along with the new requirements which require
motor carriers to comply with the NRHM routing designations of States and Indian tribes. The intent of these requirements
is to ensure that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting
requirements of various jurisdictions.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1990, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;615,
104 Stat. 3244) was enacted and amended the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 (HMTA) (Pub. L. 93&hyph;633,
88 Stat. 2156). The FHWA was delegated the responsibility by the Secretary, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 31343, July 10, 1991; 49 CFR 1.48), to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the HMTA (now codified at 49 U.S.C.
&sect;&sect;5112 and 5125 (1994), Pub. L. 103&hyph;272, 108 Stat. 745). This included the rulemaking and program
responsibility for hazardous materials highway routing, with the exception of currently pending applications
for inconsistency rulings and non-preemption determinations which remain a responsibility of the Research and
Special Programs Administration (RSPA).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5112(b) of title 49, United States Code, requires the Secretary to establish by regulation standards for
States and Indian tribes to use in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing these routing designations. These Federal
standards shall provide for enhancement of safety; public participation; transportation of hazardous materials
between adjacent areas; consultation with other States, Indian tribal and local governments; through highway routing;
reasonable time to reach agreement between affected States or Indian tribes; avoidance of unreasonable burden on
commerce; timely establishment of State and Indian tribe routing; reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities;
State responsibility for local compliance; and a number of ``factors'' for States and Indian tribes to consider.
Section 5112(b)(2) prohibits the Secretary from assigning specific weights to the ``factors to consider'' in the
Federal standards, but Sections 5125(c) and 5112(d) do provide for Federal preemption and dispute resolution of
State and Indian tribe routing designations to allow for consistent application of the Federal standards among adjacent
jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5112(c) also requires the Secretary, in coordination with the States, to periodically update and publish
a list of currently effective hazardous materials highway route designations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes that 49 CFR 177.810 exempts State and local regulations and ordinances regarding the kind, character,
or quantity of any hazardous material, except radioactive materials, transported through urban tunnels used for
mass transportation from parts 170 to 189 of the hazardous materials regulations. However, this section does not
exempt State, Indian tribes and local governments from having to comply with the routing regulations applicable
to the transportation of Class 7 (radioactive) materials (49 CFR 397, subpart D) or the routing regulations established
herein. Therefore, tunnel routing designations are now subject to the same Federal standards and procedures as are
other highway routing designations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the States and local governments in the development of routes, the DOT published ``Guidelines for Selecting
Preferred Highway Routes for Highway Route Controlled Quantity Shipments of Radioactive Materials'' (latest edition
DOT/RSPA/OHMT&hyph;89/01 dated August 1992) and ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting
Hazardous Materials'' (latest edition DOT/RSPA/OHMT&hyph;89&hyph;02 dated July 1989). The latter publication
is being updated to provide guidance on the Federal standards in this regulation. Both guides are useful in developing
highway routing requirements for hazardous materials. These documents are available to the public through the National
Technical Information Service, Springfield, Virginia 21661. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking and a notice of public hearings entitled ``Transportation of Hazardous
Materials; Highway Routing'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 31, 1992 (57 FR 39522). The FHWA requested comments from any interested parties to be submitted to Docket
MC&hyph;92&hyph;6 by October 30, 1992. In addition, the FHWA held four public hearings to solicit comments from interested
parties in October at Washington, D.C.; Dallas, Texas; San Francisco, California; and Rosemont, Illinois.

Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of fifty-six commenters responded to this proposed regulation by written submission to the docket and/or
presentation at the public hearings. The commenters represented a total of fifty-two organizations, including
twenty-seven commercial/trade affiliated organizations representing shippers and carriers, fourteen State
government organizations, five local governments, three Federal agencies, one Indian tribe, one citizens' group,
and one consulting firm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nineteen commenters supported and eight opposed the overall format and/or intent of the proposed regulations. The
remaining commenters did not express overall opposition or support for the regulation but did comment on specific
parts of the regulation. Fifty-four commenters discussed details of the proposed rule, and many recommended changes
to various aspects of the rule. The following topics were of main concern.

Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Definitions were discussed by fifteen commenters who recommended clarification of some definitions and additional
definitions for some terms used in the regulation. These comments were submitted from eight members of the shipper-carrier
industry, four States, one local government, one Federal agency and a citizens' group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters recommended clarification of the definition of ``routing designations.'' The main concern was
that routing designations broadly defined could include licenses, permits, bonds, and other restrictions or requirements
which might not be route-specific. In response to these concerns, the FHWA has clarified routing designations to
include route-specific features, such as: designations of routes, restrictions on routes, curfews/time-of-travel
restrictions on routes, lane restrictions, routing bans, port-of-entry requirements, and weight restrictions
on routes which are specifically related to NRHM. Common State, Indian tribal, or local regulatory requirements
are not ``routing designations'' when they are not route specific. These can include fee, bonding/insurance, notice,
escort, permit, registration, inspection, and communication requirements which are generally applied to entire
jurisdictions rather than specific highway routes. Such jurisdictional restrictions are not covered under this
regulation. Their possible preemption is determined by the RSPA, not the FHWA. Other restrictions on motor vehicles
that are not specific to the transportation of hazardous materials, such as height, weight, or width restrictions

by this regulation.

Motor Carrier Responsibilities for Routing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters recommended clarifying the applicability of the rule to placarded and marked vehicles. These commenters
were concerned that the regulation would be applicable to placarded NRHM transport while other motor carrier regulations
are applicable to both placarded and marked NRHM transport. The FHWA has amended &sect;397.67(b), which deals with
the motor carriers responsibilities, to include motor vehicles that are marked or placarded.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One State recommended that reasonable deviation cover highway and law enforcement situations that require a driver
to take an alternative route. The FHWA agreed with this recommendation and amended &sect;397.67(b)(3) to provide
for highway agency detours, such as in work zones, and law enforcement situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA also amended the terms ``Class A or Class B explosives'' to ``Explosives, in Class 1, Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3''
so as to be consistent with the current terminology in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR 171&hyph;180).

Quantities of NRHM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters recommended limiting the placarded quantity and type of NRHM for which the regulation applied, such
as to bulk rather than to vehicles transporting small individual cylinders of hazardous materials. The FHWA did not
adopt this recommendation because 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(a)(1) requires that the highway routing regulations apply
to a vehicle if such vehicle is transporting in commerce a hazardous material for which placarding of the vehicle is
required. This section authorized the Secretary of Transportation to extend application of the regulations to other
hazardous materials, but did not authorize limiting their application to only ``in bulk'' hazardous materials.

Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-four commenters discussed the factors which States and Indian tribes must consider in developing NRHM routing
designations. These commenters included twelve shippers and carriers, four States, three local governments, three
Federal agencies, one citizens' group and one consulting firm. Eleven commenters recommended clarification of
the factors and development of specific measures or benchmarks by which the factors could be evaluated. These commenters
were concerned that the factors can be applied differently by various jurisdictions, resulting in different routing
designations. Sixteen commenters indicated that specific risk criteria should be considered more important than
the other factors, while seven commenters recommended the Federal government establish minimum criteria for each
of the factors. The FHWA declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA specifically provided the States
and Indian tribes with the flexibility to determine how each standard should be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters mentioned the importance of providing updated Federal guidelines for analyzing the factors; five
commenters recommended additional factors, including accident histories, the use of tunnels, and hours of service
for drivers; and several commenters recommended clarification of the terms ``unreasonably burden commerce,''
``climatic conditions,'' and ``congestion factors.'' In response to these comments, the FHWA revised several of
the factors. The factor on ``terrain considerations'' was amended to include both accident severity and clean up
of spills; ``alternative routes'' was amended to specifically consider safety; ``climatic conditions'' was amended
to provide examples, such as snow, high winds, ice, and fog; and ``consideration of accident history'' was added to
the congestion factor. Additionally, the FHWA is in the process of updating the guidelines for analyzing routing
designations and intends to address each of the factors in the updated publication.

Grandfather Provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notice of proposed rulemaking contained a section incorporating the grandfather clauses included in the HMTA
as amended by the HMTUSA. One clause provides that routing designations established before November 16, 1990, are
not required to comply with the factors discussed in &sect;397.71 of the regulation. Another clause provides that
the routing designations established before the date of issuance of these regulations do not have to be in accordance
with the routing standards dealing with public participation, consultation with other jurisdictions, and timeliness.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA received numerous comments from the public expressing their concern that incorporation of these grandfather
clauses in the regulation resulted in unnecessary confusion. The FHWA agrees. A strict reading of the grandfather
clauses would make the factors established in this regulation retroactively applicable to routing designations
established after enactment of the HMTUSA on November 16, 1990. It would be impracticable and unduly burdensome on
the States and Indian tribes to interpret the statute in such a manner. The FHWA would be applying to these routing designations
factors that did not exist in Federal regulations at that time. As a result, the FHWA has decided to apply the factors
established in this final rule prospectively from 30 days after the date of publication in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action should not be interpreted to mean that the routing designations established prior to the publication
of the final rule are not subject to Federal preemption. These routing designations are still subject to Federal preemption
under 49 U.S.C. &sect;5125(a), if_

Jurisdictional Coordination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-two commenters addressed the issue of jurisdictional coordination between Federal, State, Indian tribal,
and local governments in the routing designation process. These commenters included ten members of the shipper-carrier
industry, eight States, two local governments, one Federal agency, and one consulting firm. Fourteen commenters
expressed concern about the role of the Federal government versus State and local governments. Many of the commenters
did not recommend changes to the regulation but expressed their concerns about the administration of this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters discussed the potential for conflicts between States, between local jurisdictions, and between
States and local jurisdictions. Eight commenters were concerned that the required communications between States,
Indian tribes, and local jurisdictions would not be adequately coordinated. The FHWA revised &sect;397.71(b)(3)(i),
dealing with consultation with others, to provide for better interagency coordination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments from shippers and carriers recommended increasing the State, Indian tribal, or local governments' burden
in establishing and administering a routing designation. For example, their recommendations included requiring
States to produce a risk analysis for each class of NRHM for a specific route designation and for each route designation
that transfers risk from one jurisdiction to another. They also recommended that States develop consistent standards
to be used by all local jurisdictions. State and local governments, on the other hand, expressed concerns about the
proposed requirements that would be imposed on them in establishing and maintaining routing designations. These
comments focused on the administrative burdens associated with the proposed requirements, such as those involving
records maintenance, public hearings, and those that would require a finding that any routing designation would
enhance public safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that the increased requirements proposed by the shipper and carrier industries would unduly burden
State and local governments without producing a corresponding safety benefit. Similarly, the FHWA believes that
the requirements proposed in the NPRM are the minimum necessary to ensure that States or Indian tribes adopting routing
designations fully and fairly consider all of the factors required under the law. Accordingly, the FHWA is promulgating
this final rule without a change in the proposed coordination requirements for establishing and administering route
designations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended that States or local governments be allowed to have varying standards which could differ
based on the type and quantity of material involved. The FHWA believes that no changes are necessary since States are
already provided the latitude to determine how the standards in this regulation or any additional standards a State
or Indian tribe select are to be applied.

Dispute Resolution, Preemption, and Waivers of Preemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Preemption, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution procedures were discussed by fourteen commenters. These
commenters included nine members of the shipper-carrier industry, three States, one Federal agency, and one citizens'
group. Four commenters addressed eligibility or standing to petition under the dispute resolution process, with
three commenters recommending the local jurisdiction be eligible to participate in the dispute resolution process.
The FHWA decided not to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA authorizes the FHWA only to resolve disputes
between States and between States and Indian tribes. The FHWA believes that States will consider the views and concerns
of local jurisdictions in formulating their positions on preemption and preemption waiver determinations. Additionally,
the dispute resolution procedures provide affected local jurisdictions with notice and the opportunity to participate,
through their State, in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight commenters addressed waiver of preemptions. Two suggested that local governments could use this process to
circumvent State administration of routing designations, another recommended the FHWA prevent local governments
from seeking a waiver of preemption when the State has disapproved the designation, and one remarked that the waiver
of preemption process provides protection for jurisdictions where unique circumstances justify extraordinary
routing measures. The FHWA has decided not to adopt these recommendations because it believes that the finding required
by 49 CFR 397.219 (that the waived routing designation provide an equal or higher level of highway safety to the public
without unreasonably burdening commerce) is sufficient to ensure that the waiver process is not used arbitrarily.
Additionally, States are able to express their views as part of the process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters discussed the status of a routing designation pending a preemption determination, with three recommending
the use of an administrative stay until the determination is issued. Another recommended the interim status of a routing
designation be decided by the FHWA. Two commenters recommended an administrative appeals process. The FHWA believes
no changes are necessary because the procedures in 49 CFR part 397, subpart E, maintain the status of a highway routing
pending a preemption determination and provide for administrative reconsideration and judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA, in considering all the comments and the current provisions in subpart E of 49 CFR part 397, determined that
the proposed provisions should be incorporated into the existing procedures in subpart E rather than being included
as redundant procedures unique to this final rule. Consequently, &sect;397.79 Preemption determination procedure;
&sect;397.81 Waivers of preemption; &sect;397.85 Timeliness; and &sect;397.87 Judicial review of preemption
or waiver of preemption decision have been removed and this final rule has been amended to refer to the applicable sections
of subpart E, and subpart E is amended to refer to the provisions of this final rule.

Public Notification

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public notification procedures were discussed by twenty-nine commenters. This included seventeen members of the
shipper-carrier industry, five States, three Federal agencies, two local governments, one citizens' group and
one consulting firm. Thirteen commenters discussed public participation. Highway users tended to recommend more
public notification through publications, such as newspapers or the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, while two government agencies recommended reducing the publication requirements because of costs. Additionally,
five commenters discussed public hearing requirements and recommended providing an opportunity for a public hearing
rather than requiring a public hearing. The FHWA has revised the regulation to grant States and Indian tribes discretion
to hold public hearings on proposed NRHM routing designations after providing the public with notice and an opportunity
to comment. The FHWA also believes publication of the notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if
one is held, to be most appropriately administered at the State and Indian tribe level, through publications, such
as the official register of the State regulations, rather than through publication in the

Ten commenters discussed the requirement for State and Indian tribes to report routing designations to the FHWA.
The majority recommended the FHWA frequently publish new and existing route designations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

to establish a route designation to the FHWA for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Upon further review, the FHWA determined it would be more practical and appropriate to provide some form of current
information on established routing designations; consequently, the FHWA is considering alternative methods,
such as establishing an electronic bulletin board, to update and provide this information to the public in a timely
manner along with publishing annual lists of routing designations in the

Signs, Maps and Lists of Routing Designations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ten commenters were concerned about the use and availability of road signs and maps. Highway users were generally
in favor of requiring the use of road signs. They recommended that routing designations be enforceable only to the
extent they are signed. Several States, notably California and Colorado, have successfully operated rather extensive
and efficient routing systems through the use of lists and maps rather than signs. The requirement to sign all routing
designations could also be a considerable administrative and economic burden for States which have or develop extensive
routing designations. Therefore, the FHWA declines to adopt this suggestion.

Reasonable Routes to Terminals and Other Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasonable access to terminals and other facilities was discussed by fifteen commenters, including twelve shippers
and carriers, one State, one Federal entity, and one local agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters representing shippers and carriers of fuels and farm supplies recommended more flexibility be provided
for their products in designating route restrictions because many of their deliveries are local and unplanned. Seven
of these commenters, mostly representing short-haul, irregular route carriers, recommended they be exempted from
the proposed limits on reasonable access deviations, because they could impose a financial burden on them. The FHWA
declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA was specific on providing the States and Indian tribes
with the flexibility to accommodate local and special interests which may be unique to an area's geographic or commercial
situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three government agencies recommended a larger maximum deviation distance, whereas three carriers recommended
a shorter maximum deviation. In response to these comments, the FHWA amended &sect;397.71(b)(7) by replacing the
proposed requirement that such routes or deviations not exceed twice the distance of the most direct route with a requirement
that States or Indian tribes which establish or provide for reasonable access to and from designated routes use the
shortest practicable route based upon consideration of 13 factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of that section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended clarification of the applicability of reasonable access and through routing provisions
to local deliveries. The FHWA revised the reasonable access provisions to also apply to pickup and deliveries.

Through Routing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through routing issues were discussed by twenty-seven commenters, including nineteen shippers and carriers, three
Federal agencies, three States, one Indian tribe, and one citizens' action group. Fifteen commenters recommended
a decrease in the maximum deviation distance and two commenters favored an increase to as much as twice the distance
of the most direct route. Four commenters recommended elimination of percentage-based permissible routing deviations
and suggested that consideration of the factors would be adequate. Three commenters also indicated that it was inappropriate
to use an arbitrary percentage to determine the length of permissible deviations when such a percentage has no correlation
to safety. Four commenters recommended clarifying how the maximum deviation limitation would be applied to each
designated routing encountered during a trip or to the sum of all deviations contained in an entire trip. Seven commenters
recommended clarifying the difference between through routing and reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities,
and when the separate regulations are applicable. Several of the commenters recommended that deviations from through
routing should only be implemented when the deviation is safer than the through route or at least as safe and not an unreasonable
burden on commerce. The FHWA has revised the section on through routing to consider public safety and economic burden
(rather than use only percentages and mileage measurements). The revised section provides a relationship between
route deviations and public safety and requires that new routing designations have substantially lower relative
risk than the current routing. When the relative risk of the routing deviation is not substantially lower, the potential
economic effect becomes a significant factor.

Discussion of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA is implementing the requirements of the HMTUSA in a new subpart C, Routing, in Part 397 of Title 49, Code of Federal
Regulations. This regulation implements the requirements of the HMTUSA by establishing Federal standards and procedures
which States and Indian tribes are required to follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations
for the highway transportation of non-radioactive hazardous materials. The intent of these requirements is to ensure
that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting requirements
of various jurisdictions. The standards and requirements of this regulation, however, allow for the flexibility
intended in the HMTUSA. The FHWA will not designate routes used for transporting NRHM. Any State or Indian tribe that
chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations is required to comply with the Federal standards
established in this regulation. The States and Indian tribes are also required to ensure that any NRHM routing designations
by political subdivisions under their jurisdiction are established, maintained, and enforced in accordance with
this regulation. Any NRHM routing designations that fail to comply with the standards can be preempted. Any State,
political subdivision thereof, Indian tribe, business, organization, or individual affected by a NRHM routing
designation can apply to the Federal Highway Administrator (Administrator) for a preemption determination pursuant
to 49 CFR 397, subpart E, which contains procedures for Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemptions,
and petition for reconsideration. Procedures for dispute resolution are included in this final rule (49 CFR 397,
subpart C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations require States and Indian tribes to report existing NRHM routing designations within their boundaries
to the FHWA and, thereafter, to report any additions or changes to these routing designations 60 days after the effective
date of designation.

Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this regulation are applicable to States, including any political subdivisions, and Indian tribes
that establish, maintain, or enforce any highway routing designations over which placarded NRHM may or may not be
transported. The regulation also contains several provisions which are applicable to motor carriers transporting
NRHM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation requires States, including political subdivisions, and Indian tribes to comply with Federal standards
in establishing NRHM highway routing designations and to follow certain procedures. This regulation also requires
States and Indian tribes that establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations to report these routing designations
to the FHWA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Motor carriers transporting NRHM as of the effective date of this regulation are required to comply with the NRHM routing
designations of States or Indian tribes. Where States and Indian tribes have not established NRHM routing designations,
motor carriers are required to operate in accordance with 49 CFR 397.67, previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(a), over
routes that avoid heavily populated areas, places where crowds are assembled, tunnels, narrow streets, or alleys.
The routing plan requirements previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(b) for transporting Class 1 explosives, divisions
1.1, 1.2, 1.3, as defined in 49 CFR 173.50 and 173.53, have also been incorporated into the same section.

State and Indian Tribe Jurisdiction Over Routing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States and Indian tribes are required to comply with this regulation if they impose routing designations for NRHM.
If a political subdivision of a State wishes to impose NRHM routing designations, the State is required to ensure that
the political subdivision follows these regulations, including coordination with and approval by the routing agency
designated by the Governor. The State is responsible for all NRHM routing designations that local jurisdictions
establish, including resolving any disputes between local jurisdictions. The regulation requires the States and
Indian tribes to designate routing agencies who will be responsible for ensuring that all NRHM routing designations
are made in accordance, and substantively comply, with the procedural requirements of the Federal standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Federal Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation establishes standards which closely follow the specific requirements of 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(b)
and include procedures for States and Indian tribes to follow if they impose routing designations for NRHM transportation
by motor carriers. The Federal standards provide for enhancement of safety; public participation; consultation
with other State, local, and tribal governments; through routing; reasonable time to reach agreement between affected
States or Indian tribes; not unduly burdening commerce; timely establishment of State and Indian tribe routing;
reasonable routes to terminals; State responsibility for local compliance; and a number of ``factors to consider.''
The list of ``factors to consider'' which States (political subdivisions) and Indian tribes are required to use in
regulating routing is contained in &sect;397.71 of this final rule and includes the factors required by 49 U.S.C.
&sect;5112(b)(1)(I) and additional factors addressing climatic conditions, congestion, and accident analysis.
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(b)(2), the FHWA will not assign any specific weight to be given by the States
or Indian tribes in considering the factors. Additionally, in analyzing these factors, the States or Indian tribes
shall use the most current version of ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting Hazardous
Materials'' or an equivalent routing analysis.

2. Public Information and Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5112(c) of title 49, United States Code, requires the Secretary, in coordination with the States, to periodically
update and publish a list of current hazardous materials highway routing designations. Accordingly, the FHWA will
compile and publish annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a listing of all hazardous materials routing designations. The FHWA will also maintain a list of all current designations,
including additions and changes, and provide this information, upon request, to interested parties. To comply with
this requirement, the FHWA is, through this regulation, requiring States and Indian tribes to initially submit,

3. Dispute Resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Disputes involving highway routing agreements between political jurisdictions within a State are to be resolved
by the State's routing agency. Unresolved disputes involving through highway routing or routing designation agreements
between States or Indian tribes may be submitted to the Administrator for resolution. Details of the dispute shall
be furnished to the Administrator by the petitioner, together with a description of what was done to try to settle it,
plus a recommendation of the actions that should be taken by the Administrator to resolve the dispute. The FHWA has
revised &sect;397.75 of this regulation to clearly set forth the importance of public safety in any routing designation.
The State or Indian tribe filing the petition for dispute resolution shall be responsible for providing a comparative
risk analysis for the proposed routing designation and the current routing condition. Once a dispute is submitted
to the Administrator, no court action may be taken for one year or until after a decision by the Administrator, whichever
occurs first.

5. Preemption Determinations and Waivers of Preemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 24, 1992, the FHWA published an interim final rule (57 FR 44132) amending 49 CFR 397 by adding a subpart
E which established procedures applicable to preemption determinations and waivers of preemption. This final rule
amends subpart E to make these procedures applicable to NRHM routing designations which are now included in subpart
C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any highway routing designation established, maintained or enforced by a State, a political subdivision thereof,
or an Indian tribe is preempted if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compliance with both the highway routing designation and any requirement of chapter 51 of title 49, United States
Code, or of a regulation prescribed thereunder is not possible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The highway routing designation, as applied or enforced is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out chapter
51 of title 49, United States Code, or the regulations prescribed thereunder; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A State or Indian tribe establishes, maintains or enforces any routing designation that does not comply with the
procedural and substantive requirements of the Federal standards set forth in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, including a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe, affected by a NRHM routing designation
can apply to the Administrator for a determination of whether such routing designation is preempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State, political subdivision, or Indian tribe may apply to the Administrator for a waiver of preemption. The Administrator
is authorized to waive preemption of a NRHM routing designation, based on a determination that it provides equal or
better protection to the public than these regulations would provide, and it does not unreasonably burden commerce.

Technical Amendments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 103&hyph;272 (108 Stat. 745), enacted on July 5, 1994, codified certain U.S. transportation laws as title
49, United States Code. Like other transportation statutes, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act was repealed
and its contents restated in title 49. This final rule changes the citations contained in the NPRM to conform to the
provisions of the new law.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking document was reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The FHWA has determined
that this regulation is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of that Order. This rulemaking is considered
a significant regulation under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures because of substantial
congressional and public interest. This interest involves minimizing risks while allowing reasonable highway
routing for the transportation of NRHM. The regulation does not require the establishment of NRHM routing designations
or the use of Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but does provide
standards and procedures which are required to be followed if these actions are taken. The FHWA believes that for those
States or Indian tribal governments which choose to adopt routing designations, the benefits from implementing
these regulations, such as NRHM routing designation continuity, public participation, uniform standards, and
preemption and dispute resolution procedures, will be greater than the costs, such as providing the required documentation,
coordination, and analysis which allow discretion in level of detail. The FHWA anticipates that the economic impact
of this regulation will be minimal based upon a regulatory evaluation.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;354; 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this regulation on small entities
such as Indian tribes, local governments, and small businesses. The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards
which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific
highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements
for highway routing). The regulation does not require the use of NRHM routing designations or Federal preemption
determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but provides standards and procedures which are
required to be followed if these actions are chosen to be used. The discretionary nature of the actions allows for cost
saving options to be used in balancing the needs in commerce and the risks in the transportation of NRHM. To date, relatively
few States and local jurisdictions have chosen to establish NRHM routing designations. The FHWA has concluded that
the regulation does not substantially affect the ability of, or cost to, local jurisdictions establishing needed
NRHM routing designations. The preemption and dispute resolution procedures provide all entities more effective
and efficient means of resolving routing issues. Based on this evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this regulation
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish,
maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported
within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements for highway routing). The regulation recognizes the State
and Indian tribal role in the designation of highway routes for NRHM while de-emphasizing the role of local governments.
The regulation provides for discretion by the States and Indian tribes as to whether they impose NRHM routing designations.
Each State and Indian tribe is free to establish NRHM routing designations tailored to its own needs in accordance
with the Federal standards, using the DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting
Hazardous Materials,'' or an equivalent routing analysis which adequately considers overall risk to the public.
States and localities have a better understanding of the relative safety of the highways within their jurisdictions
than does the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation limits the policymaking discretion of the States, their political subdivisions and Indian tribes.
The regulation is necessary, however, to achieve the purposes and implement the requirements of the HMTUSA. Accordingly,
it is certified that this action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles, criteria, and requirements
contained in Executive Order 12612 and, it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The State or Indian tribe shall provide the public with notice of any proposed NRHM routing designation and a 30-day
period in which to comment. At any time during this period or following review of the comments received, the State or
Indian tribe shall decide whether to hold a public hearing on the proposed NRHM route designation. The public shall
be given 30 days prior notice of the public hearing which shall be conducted as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of
this section. Notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held, shall be given by publication
in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the affected area or areas and shall contain a complete description
of the proposed routing designation, together with the date, time, and location of any public hearings. Notice for
both the comment period and any public hearing may also be published in the official register of the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If it is determined that a public hearing is necessary, the State or Indian tribe shall hold at least one public
hearing on the record during which the public will be afforded the opportunity to present their views and any information
or data related to the proposed NRHM routing designation. The State shall make available to the public, upon payment
of prescribed costs, copies of the transcript of the hearing, which shall include all exhibits and documents presented
during the hearing or submitted for the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consultation with others. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe
shall provide notice to, and consult with, officials of affected political subdivisions, States and Indian tribes,
and any other affected parties. Such actions shall include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) At least 60 days prior to establishing a routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice, in
writing, of the proposed routing designation to officials responsible for highway routing in all other affected
States or Indian tribes. A copy of this notice may also be sent to all affected political subdivisions. This notice
shall request approval, in writing, by those States or Indian tribes, of the proposed routing designations. If no
response is received within 60 days from the day of receipt of the notification of the proposed routing designation,
the routing designation shall be considered approved by the affected State or Indian tribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The manner in which consultation under this paragraph is conducted is left to the discretion of the State or Indian
tribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The State or Indian tribe shall attempt to resolve any concern or disagreement expressed by any consulted official
related to the proposed routing designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The State or Indian tribe shall keep a record of the names and addresses of the officials notified pursuant to this
section and of any consultation or meeting conducted with these officials or their representatives. Such record
shall describe any concern or disagreement expressed by the officials and any action undertaken to resolve such disagreement
or address any concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Through routing. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall ensure through
highway routing for the transportation of NRHM between adjacent areas. The term ``through highway routing'' as used
in this paragraph means that the routing designation must ensure continuity of movement so as to not impede or unnecessarily
delay the transportation of NRHM. The State or Indian tribe shall utilize the procedures established in paragraphs
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section in meeting these requirements. In addition, the State or Indian tribe shall make
a finding, supported by a risk analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the routing
designation enhances public safety. If the risk analysis shows_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That the current routing presents at least 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation under the proposed
routing designation, then the proposed routing designation may go into effect.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) That the current routing presents a greater risk but less than 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation
under the proposed routing restriction, then the proposed routing restriction made by a State or Indian tribe shall
only go into effect if it does not force a deviation of more than 25 miles or result in an increase of more than 25 percent
of that part of a trip affected by the deviation, whichever is shorter, from the most direct route through a jurisdiction
as compared to the intended deviation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) That the current route has the same or less risk to the public than the deviation resulting from the proposed routing
designation, then the routing designation shall not be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Agreement of other States; burden on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation which affects another State or Indian
tribe shall be established, maintained, or enforced only if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It does not unreasonably burden commerce, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) It is agreed to by the affected State or Indian tribe within 60 days of receipt of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph
(b)(3)(i) of this section, or it is approved by the Administrator pursuant to &sect;397.75. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Timeliness. The establishment of a NRHM routing designation by any State or Indian tribe shall be completed within
18 months of the notice given in either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, whichever occurs first. (7) Reasonable
routes to terminals and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. In establishing or providing for reasonable access to and from designated routes, the State or Indian
tribe shall use the shortest practicable route considering the factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide reasonable access for motor
vehicles transporting NRHM to reach: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Terminals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Points of loading, unloading, pickup and delivery, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Facilities for food, fuel, repairs, rest, and safe havens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Responsibility for local compliance. The States shall be responsible for ensuring that all of their political
subdivisions comply with the provisions of this subpart. The States shall be responsible for resolving all disputes
between such political subdivisions within their jurisdictions. If a State or any political subdivision thereof,
or an Indian tribe chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce any NRHM routing designation, the Governor, or Indian
tribe, shall designate a routing agency for the State or Indian tribe, respectively. The routing agency shall ensure
that all NRHM routing designations within its jurisdiction comply with the Federal standards in this section. The
State or Indian tribe shall comply with the public information and reporting requirements contained in &sect;397.73.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Factors to consider. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall consider the
following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Population density. The population potentially exposed to a NRHM release shall be estimated from the density
of the residents, employees, motorists, and other persons in the area, using United States census tract maps or other
reasonable means for determining the population within a potential impact zone along a designated highway route.
The impact zone is the potential range of effects in the event of a release. Special populations such as schools, hospitals,
prisons, and senior citizen homes shall, among other things, be considered when determining the potential risk to
the populations along a highway routing. Consideration shall be given to the amount of time during which an area will
experience a heavy population density.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Type of highway. The characteristics of each alternative NRHM highway routing designation shall be compared.
Vehicle weight and size limits, underpass and bridge clearances, roadway geometrics, number of lanes, degree of
access control, and median and shoulder structures are examples of characteristics which a State or Indian tribe
shall consider.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Types and quantities of NRHM. An examination shall be made of the type and quantity of NRHM normally transported
along highway routes which are included in a proposed NRHM routing designation, and consideration shall be given
to the relative impact zone and risks of each type and quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Emergency response capabilities. In consultation with the proper fire, law enforcement, and highway safety
agencies, consideration shall be given to the emergency response capabilities which may be needed as a result of a
NRHM routing designation. The analysis of the emergency response capabilities shall be based upon the proximity
of the emergency response facilities and their capabilities to contain and suppress NRHM releases within the impact
zones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Results of consultation with affected persons. Consideration shall be given to the comments and concerns of all
affected persons and entities provided during public hearings and consultations conducted in accordance with this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Exposure and other risk factors. States and Indian tribes shall define the exposure and risk factors associated
with any NRHM routing designations. The distance to sensitive areas shall be considered. Sensitive areas include,
but are not limited to, homes and commercial buildings; special populations in hospitals, schools, handicapped
facilities, prisons and stadiums; water sources such as streams and lakes; and natural areas such as parks, wetlands,
and wildlife reserves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Terrain considerations. Topography along and adjacent to the proposed NRHM routing designation that may affect
the potential severity of an accident, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release and the control and clean up of NRHM if
released shall be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Continuity of routes. Adjacent jurisdictions shall be consulted to ensure routing continuity for NRHM across
common borders. Deviations from the most direct route shall be minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Alternative routes. Consideration shall be given to the alternative routes to, or resulting from, any NRHM route
designation. Alternative routes shall be examined, reviewed, or evaluated to the extent necessary to demonstrate
that the most probable alternative routing resulting from a routing designation is safer than the current routing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Effects on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation made in accordance with this subpart shall not create an unreasonable
burden upon interstate or intrastate commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Delays in transportation. No NRHM routing designations may create unnecessary delays in the transportation
of NRHM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Climatic conditions. Weather conditions unique to a highway route such as snow, wind, ice, fog, or other climatic
conditions that could affect the safety of a route, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release, or increase the difficulty
of controlling it and cleaning it up shall be given appropriate consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiii) Congestion and accident history. Traffic conditions unique to a highway routing such as: traffic congestion;
accident experience with motor vehicles, traffic considerations that could affect the potential for an accident,
exposure of the public to any release, ability to perform emergency response operations, or the temporary closing
of a highway for cleaning up any release shall be given appropriate consideration.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to implement section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988
(42 U.S.C. 3544; hereafter referred to as the ``McKinney Act''), as amended by section 903 of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992 (1992 HCD Act) and section 3003 of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, approved August 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 904 of the McKinney Act authorizes HUD to require applicants and participants and adult members of their families
in any HUD program involving initial and periodic review of an applicant's or participant's income to sign a consent
form authorizing: (1) HUD, the PHA, or the owner to verify employee income information from current or previous employers;
and (2) HUD or the PHA to request wage and claim information from the State agency responsible for the administration
of the State unemployment laws. On February 22, 1991, the Department published a final rule implementing section
904 of the McKinney Act (56 FR 7518). In accordance with section 904(b) of the McKinney Act, HUD regulations make signing
the consent form an explicit condition of initial or continuing eligibility for participation in the covered programs.
This requirement is designed to ensure that correct determinations of eligibility for assistance and level of assistance
are made under these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 903 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Act) amends section 904 of the McKinney Act by
adding a subsection (e) to section 904. Section 904(e) prohibits the Department from requiring the release of information
by third parties as a condition of receiving housing assistance unless the requested consent for information is in
compliance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and is appropriately limited as to time, relevance and necessity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department notes that &sect;&sect;200.1220(a) and 760.20(a) of HUD's current regulations (24 CFR 200.1220(a),
24 CFR 760.20(a)) already require that the collection of employee income, wage and claim information be conducted,
to the extent applicable, in accordance with the Privacy Act. Accordingly, this rule does not propose to make any changes
to implement this statutory requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 904(e) also requires that the consent to release such information be limited with respect to time, and only
cover information relevant and necessary to meet the requirements of section 904. In compliance with this statutory
mandate, the Department is preposing to remove the regulatory provisions which authorize the collection of information,
``including information which can be obtained under other laws, regulations and handbooks.'' The rule also proposes
to make the consent to release effective for 15 months from the time of execution, which is responsive to the recommendation
in the House conference report. (H.R. Rep. No. 760, 102 Cong., 2d Sess. at 158 (1992).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Last, section 903 of 1992 Act requires that the Department develop a new consent form. This consent form has been issued
by the Department; therefore, this proposed rule does not cover this release form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 requires that applicants and participants sign a consent
form authorizing the Secretary of HUD to request that the Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the
Treasury release information pursuant to section 6103(l)(7)(D)(ix) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Information
released under this authority would be provided to HUD for the sole purpose of verifying income information pertinent
to the applicant's or participant's eligibility or level of assisted housing benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, Section 3003 amends section 904 of the McKinney Act to allow HUD to use income return data, pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code. This information will include: wages, net earnings from self-employment, payments of retirement
income, and unearned income as referenced in sections 6103(l)(7)(A) and 6103(l)7)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.
HUD may match this information to information provided by applicants or participants when applying for initial or
continued eligibility for assisted housing programs.

A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this proposed rule relate to internal administrative
procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project
areas or building sites and, therefore are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act.

B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the requirements of this proposed rule
are directed toward applicants and participants in federally assisted housing programs. It effects no significant
changes in the current relationships between the federal government, the states and their political subdivisions
in connection with these programs.

C. Executive Order 12606, the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. Under the proposed rule, applicants and participants, and adult
members of their families, are required to sign and submit consent forms authorizing the verification or collection
of certain information necessary for determining eligibility for or level of assistance under the covered programs.
Consent forms to permit verification of information provided by the family are already required. This proposed rule
would prohibit the collection of information which is not necessary to verify the income of an applicant or participant,
and makes the consent form valid for 15 months. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This proposed rule relates to applicants and participants in federally assisted housing
projects but should not have a meaningful economic impact on these entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Washington for
the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The implementation
plan was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements of an approvable moderate nonattainment
area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Tacoma, Washington.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document.

On July 29, 1994 EPA proposed two drinking water regulations: the Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts (D/DBP)
and Enhanced Surface Water Treatment (ESWTR) rules. These proposals were the product of a negotiated rulemaking.
The negotiators included State and local health and regulatory agency staff and elected officials, consumer groups,
environmental groups, and representatives of public water systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The group agreed to propose a disinfectant/disinfection byproduct rule to extend coverage to all community and non
transient, non-community water systems that use disinfectants, reduce the current total trihalomethane (TTHM)
maximum contaminant level (MCL), regulate additional disinfection byproducts, set limits for the use of disinfectants,
and reduce the level of compounds that may react with disinfectants to form byproducts. The group further agreed that
revisions to the current Surface Water Treatment Rule might be required at the same time to ensure that microbial risk
is not increased as byproduct rules go into effect, and to provide explicit control of Cryptosporidium. As a result,
the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule was proposed with a number of options for microbial control, including
the option to simply retain the requirements of the current Surface Water Treatment Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the hearings is to provide the public an opportunity to hear a description of the regulations and to obtain
comment from the public on the rules. This notice corrects the hearing dates which were listed in the July 29, 1994 proposals.
The comment period for submission of formal written comments in response to the D/DBPR rule closes December 29, 1994.
The comment period for formal written comments in response to the ESWTR rule closes May 30, 1996 to allow time for the
public to consider data being collected prior to that date. The Agency may hold additional hearings on the ESWTR to
consider those additional data.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to amend the financial assurance regulations under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act in two program areas. First, the Agency proposes to add two financial assurance mechanisms
to those currently available to assure closure, post-closure, or corrective action costs associated with municipal
solid waste landfills under subtitle D: (1) a financial test for use by corporate owners and operators, and (2) a guarantee
for use by firms that wish to guarantee the costs for an owner or operator. Second, the Agency proposes to modify the
domestic asset component of the corporate financial test for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities
under subtitle C.

These amendments to part 258 are proposed under the authority of sections 1008, 4004, and 4010 of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6907, 6944, and 6949a. The amendments to parts 264 and 265 are proposed
under RCRA sections 3004 and 3005.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, the Agency promulgated revised criteria for municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs), which
established minimum Federal standards to assure that MSWLFs are designed and managed in a manner that is protective
of human health and the environment, taking into account the practical capability of the MSWLFs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 56 FR 50978). The minimum Federal standards include location restrictions, facility design and operating criteria,
groundwater monitoring, corrective action, financial assurance, closure, and post-closure care requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency proposed the MSWLF criteria, including financial assurance requirements, on August 30, 1988 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 53 FR 33314). The purpose of the financial assurance requirements of the MSWLF criteria was to assure that adequate
funds will be readily available to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action associated
with MSWLFs. The Agency believes that these financial assurance provisions are an important part of the MSWLF criteria
for two reasons. First, when an owner or operator does not have funds readily available to address the environmental
needs at a facility, delays in addressing those needs can result. Second, if the owner or operator does not have funds
to address environmental needs at its facilities, those needs are typically addressed under federal or state cleanup
authorities, rather than by the party responsible for the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 30, 1988 proposal, rather than propose specific financial assurance mechanisms, the Agency proposed
a financial assurance performance standard. The Agency solicited public comment on this performance standard approach
and, at the same time, requested comment on whether the Agency should develop financial test mechanisms for use by
local governments and corporations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the proposed rule argued that the proposed performance standard lacked sufficient detail to guide
States in the development and implementation of requirements with any consistency among States, and that the Agency
should develop specific mechanisms that could be used to demonstrate financial assurance. Commenters also supported
the development of a local government financial test and a corporate financial test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comment, the Agency promulgated several specific financial mechanisms in the October 9, 1991, final
rule. Those mechanisms include trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance, and State assumptions of
responsibility (&sect;258.74). In addition, to retain States' flexibility in implementing the subtitle D program,
the Agency promulgated the financial assurance performance standard of &sect;258.74, which allows approved States
to use any State-approved mechanism that meets that performance standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the August 30, 1988, proposal also supported the development of financial tests for local governments
and for corporations. The Agency agreed with commenters but, at the time the final MSWLF criteria were promulgated,
the Agency had not completed the analyses necessary to propose those financial tests. Thus, in the October 9, 1991,
preamble, the Agency announced its intention to develop both a local government and corporate financial test in advance
of the effective date of the financial assurance provisions. The Agency then proceeded to conduct the necessary analysis,
and develop a local government and corporate financial test for MSWLF owners and operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allow time to develop financial tests, the Agency promulgated an effective date of April 9, 1994, for the financial
assurance provisions in the July 1, 1991 notice. In doing so, the Agency believed it had allowed adequate time to promulgate
the local government and corporate financial tests in advance of the effective date. However, those financial tests
are taking longer to develop than the Agency originally anticipated. As the April 1994, deadline approached, the
Agency recognized that it would be unable to promulgate final financial tests by that time. Thus, on October 11, 1993,
the Agency extended the effective date of the financial assurance provisions until April 9, 1995 (

The Agency proposed a local government financial test on December 27, 1993 (see 58 FR 68353); this document proposes
the corporate financial test for MSWLFs.

III. Summary of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would add a corporate financial test to the financial assurance mechanisms currently available
to owners and operators of subtitle D MSWLFs. It also would allow corporations to use that financial test to guarantee
the costs of an owner or operator. It would allow owners and operators to use a combination of financial assurance mechanisms,
including this financial test, to assure the costs associated with their facilities. Finally, this rule proposes
revisions to one portion of the subtitle C corporate financial test, specifically, to the domestic asset requirement
of that test. Discussion of the proposed revisions to the subtitle D provisions can be found in sections IV&hyph;V
of this preamble. A discussion of the proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test can be found in
section IX.

IV. Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Subtitle D Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Corporate Financial Test (Section 258.74(e)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed corporate financial test includes a financial component and a domestic asset component. Owners and
operators that meet the requirements of the financial test also must comply with certain recordkeeping and reporting
requirements. Each requirement is described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Financial Component (Section 258.74(e)(1)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial component is designed to measure viability of the owner or operator, based on its current financial
condition. To satisfy the financial component, a firm must have a minimum tangible net worth of $10 million plus the
costs it seeks to assure (e.g., closure, post-closure, corrective action), either satisfy a bond rating requirement,
or pass one of two financial ratios, and satisfy a domestic asset requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Size Requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;258.74(e)(1)(ii), the Agency is proposing to require firms using the financial test to have a tangible net
worth at least equal to the sum of the costs they seek to assure through a financial test plus $10 million. Under proposed
&sect;258.74 (e)(3), the costs an owner or operator seeks to assure are equal to the current cost estimates for closure,
post-closure care, and corrective action or the sum of such costs to be covered, and any other environmental obligations
assured by a financial test. The owner or operator must include cost estimates required for municipal solid waste
management facilities under this part, as well as cost estimates required for the following environmental obligations,
if it assures them through a financial test: obligations associated with UIC facilities under 40 CFR 144.62, petroleum
underground storage tank facilities under 40 CFR part 280, PCB storage facilities under 40 CFR part 761, and hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing this minimum tangible net worth requirement to ensure that the costs of closure, post-closure
care, or corrective action do not force a firm into bankruptcy. Further, an analysis of a sample of bankrupt firms conducted
by the Agency demonstrated that firms with less than $10 million in net worth failed four times more frequently than
firms with greater than $10 million in tangible net worth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Agency believes that this minimum net worth should be required as an initial screen for corporations
in demonstrating financial responsibility for the very large costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective
action. The Agency then combined this requirement with other financial criteria to develop the financial test described
in this proposed rule. A more detailed discussion of this analysis can be found in Section V. of this preamble and the
Background Document developed in support of this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bond Rating/Financial Ratio Alternatives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to allow firms that meet the minimum size requirement to satisfy the remaining requirements
of the financial test in one of two ways.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, under the proposed &sect;258.74(e)(1)(i)(A), a firm could satisfy the financial component if its most recent
bond rating is investment grade, that is, Aaa, Aa, A or Baa, as issued by Moody's, or AAA, AA, A, or BBB, as issued by Standard
and Poor's. The Agency is proposing this option because it believes that a firm's bond rating incorporates an evaluation
of a firm's financial management practices. Bond ratings reflect the expert opinion of bond rating services, which
are organizations that have established credibility in the financial community for their assessments of firm financial
conditions. An analysis of bond ratings showed that bond ratings have been a good indicator of firm defaults, and that
few firms with investment grade ratings have in fact gone bankrupt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to include a bond rating option in this financial test is consistent with other Agency programs. For example,
the regulations governing TSDFs under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265, petroleum underground storage tanks under 40 CFR part
280, UIC facilities under 40 CFR part 144, and PCB commercial storage facilities under 40 CFR part 761 all consider
bond ratings as part of their financial tests. The local government financial test for owners and operators of MSWLFs
under 40 CFR part 258, which was proposed on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68353) also would allow a bond rating option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, to provide the regulated community with flexibility in meeting the financial test, the Agency is also proposing
a ratio alternative to the bond rating. In order to satisfy the ratio requirement, a firm would have to have either:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;a leverage ratio of less than 1.5 based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth. This ratio attempts
to show the degree to which a firm is leveraged. This particular measure shows the relationship between total liabilities
to tangible net worth. Firms with higher values for this ratio are more likely to suffer net losses than those with lower
values; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;a profitability ratio of greater than 0.10 based on the ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion,
and amortization, minus $10 million, to total liabilities. This ratio attempts to show cash-flow from operations
relative to the firm's total liabilities. Firms with higher values for this measure are more likely to meet their obligations
than those firms with lower values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency selected these two specific financial ratios with their associated thresholds based on their ability
to differentiate between viable and bankrupt firms. The Agency's analysis demonstrated that leverage ratios (i.e.,
total liabilities/net worth) and profitability ratios (i.e., cash flow/total liabilities) are particularly good
discriminators of financial health. The Agency selected as thresholds for these ratios values that, together with
the other financial test criteria, minimized the costs associated with demonstrating financial responsibility.
A more detailed discussion of this analysis can be found in Section V. of this preamble and the Background Document
developed in support of this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Domestic Assets Requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;258.74(e)(1)(iii), the Agency is proposing that all firms using the financial test have assets in the United
States at least equal to the costs they seek to assure through a financial test. (see paragraph a. of this section, ``Minimum
Size Requirement,'' for more discussion on assured costs) The domestic asset requirement is intended to ensure that
the Agency has access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. Without this requirement, the Agency could experience substantial
difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms that have their assets outside of the United States. The Agency recognizes
that this minimum assets requirement may be too low and solicits comment on an assets requirement that provides the
Agency with adequate assurance that funds will be available in the event that an owner or operator enters bankruptcy,
but does not overly burden the regulated community.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing that after a firm has determined that it is eligible to use this corporate financial test, it
would be required to document its use of the test by placing three items (discussed below) in the facility operating
record. These requirements would help ensure that the self-implementing aspect of the proposed test requirements
have been met. In the case of closure and post-closure care, these items would have to be placed in the operating record
prior to the initial receipt of waste or the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later, or in the case of corrective
action, no later than 120 days following selection of a corrective action remedy. This proposed requirement, in the
case of corrective action remedy, is consistent with the subtitle C provision in the subpart S proposed rulemaking
(55 FR at 30855 July 27, 1990), as well as the Financial Assurance for Corrective Action (FACA) proposed rulemaking
(51 FR at 37854 October 24, 1986). Please refer to these proposals for more discussion on this requirement. In addition,
owners and operators would be required to update these items annually, and to notify the State Director and obtain
alternative financial assurance if the firm is no longer able to pass the financial test. These proposed criteria
are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chief financial officer (CFO) letter. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;258.74(e)(2)(i), the owner or operator would be required to submit a letter from the firm's CFO. The letter
would demonstrate that the firm has complied with the criteria of the test. Specifically, the letter would list all
cost estimates covered by a financial test and provide evidence that the firm satisfies the financial criteria of
the test (i.e., the financial component, including the minimum size component and domestic assets requirement).
The Agency expects that this evidence will include a worksheet or similar demonstration showing that the firm's annual
financial data meet the specific measures required by the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accountant's opinion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;258.74(e)(2)(ii), the Agency is also proposing to require the owner or operator to place in the operating
record the opinion from the independent certified public accountant of the firm's financial statements for the latest
completed fiscal year. Further requirements of the CFO's letter are described in &sect;258.74(e)(2)(iii). An unqualified
opinion (i.e., a ``clean opinion'') from the accountant demonstrates that the firm has prepared its financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for corporations. However, an adverse opinion, disclaimer
of opinion, or any qualification in the opinion would automatically disqualify the owner or operator from using the
corporate financial test. The State Director of an approved State may evaluate qualified opinions on a case by case
basis, however, and accept such opinions if the matters which form the basis for the qualified opinion are insufficient
to warrant disallowance of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special report from the independent certified public accountant. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third item to be placed in the operating record would be a special report of the independent certified public accountant
upon examination of the chief financial officer's letter. In this report, the accountant would confirm that the data
used in the CFO letter to pass the test were appropriately derived from, the audited, year-end financial statements.
The purpose of this special report is to ensure that the accountant has confirmed that the financial data used in the
CFO letter is appropriately presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report would not be required if the CFO uses financial test figures directly from the annual financial statements
provided to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). However, this report is required if the CFO letter uses data
that is derived from and is not identical to the data in the annual financial statements provided to the SEC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in computing financial assurance under one alternative owners and operators are required to recognize
total liabilities, including those associated with ``post-retirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB).''
(Please see the discussion of FASB 106 in section VI of this preamble.) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
allows the use of two different methods when accounting for these liabilities in annual financial statements. FASB
106 allows employers the option of accounting for OPEB obligations in one year (immediate recognition) or over a consecutive
number of years (delayed recognition). Since both the immediate and delayed recognition methods are allowed by FASB
106, EPA does not require owners and operators that are demonstrating they meet the requirements of the financial
test to use the same accounting method for OPEB obligations that is used for annual SEC submission purposes. For example,
the owner or operator may use the immediate recognition method in the financial statement prepared for the SEC, but
the delayed recognition method in computing liabilities for the purpose of demonstrating RCRA financial assurance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing this approach in today's rule because it does not believe a separate CPA statement is needed where
the CFO simply takes figures directly from an audited financial statement. This is a straight forward process. On
the other hand, where the CFO ``derives'' the figures_for example, by using different accounting procedures to determine
OPEB liabilities_the process may require a high level of financial expertise. In these cases, EPA believes review
by an independent auditor is appropriate. The Agency solicits comment on this approach and whether this approach
would be appropriate for the financial test under subtitle C.

Annual updates and placement of financial test documentation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The financial test proposed in this action would require firms to place the items specified in &sect;258.74(e)(2)
in the operating record and notify the State Director that these items have been placed in the facilities operating
record. Because the financial condition of firms can change over time, under &sect;258.74(e)(2), firms will be required
to update annually all financial test documentation, including each of the items described above, within 90 days
of the close of the firm's fiscal year. Under &sect;258.74 (e)(2)(iv), the owner or operator is not required to submit
the items specified in &sect;258.74(e)(2) when he substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this
section; or is released from the requirements of this section in accordance with &sect;258.71(b), &sect;258.72(b),
or &sect;258.73(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternate financial assurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;258.74(e)(2)(v), if a firm can no longer meet the terms of the financial test, the owner or operator would
have to notify the State Director and obtain alternative financial assurance within 120 days of the close of the firm's
fiscal year. The alternative financial assurance selected by the owner or operator would have to meet the terms of
this section and the required submissions for that assurance would have to be placed in the facility's operating record.
The owner or operator would have to notify the State Director that he no longer meets the criteria of the financial test
and that alternate financial assurance has been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current financial test documentation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;258.74(e)(2)(vi), the Director of an approved State may, based on a reasonable belief that
the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, require the owner or operator
to provide current financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Although the Agency
anticipates this provision will not be used often, it can be important in situations where the financial condition
of the owner or operator comes into question. The State Director should have the flexibility to require the owner or
operator to provide current financial test documents if information arises that raises serious questions about
the financial conditions of the owner or operator. For example, an owner or operator may be forced into bankruptcy
by a large, well-publicized liability judgment. In such cases, the State Director should be able to investigate the
owner's or operator's change in financial condition, and require them to demonstrate that they still meet the financial
test. The Agency requests comments from the public on this proposed requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corporate Guarantee (Section 258.74(g)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to allow owners and operators to comply with financial responsibility requirements for MSWLFs
using a guarantee provided by another private firm (the guarantor). Under such a guarantee, the guarantor promises
to pay for or carry out closure, post-closure care or corrective action activities on behalf of the owner or operator
of a MSWLF if the owner or operator fails to do so. Guarantees, like other third-party mechanisms, such as letters of
credit or surety bonds, ensure that a third party is obligated to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, or
corrective action in the event that the owner or operator goes bankrupt or fails to conduct the required activities.
At the same time, a guarantee is an attractive compliance option for owners and operators, especially those affiliated
with larger corporations because guarantees are generally much less expensive than other third-party mechanisms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would allow three types of qualified guarantors: (1) The parent corporation or principal shareholder
of the owner or operator (e.g., a corporate parent or grandparent), (2) a firm whose parent company is also the parent
company of the owner or operator (a corporate sibling), and (3) other related and non-related firms with a ``substantial
business relationship'' with the owner or operator (including subsidiaries of the owner or operator). Guarantors
also would be required to meet the conditions of the corporate financial test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with the requirements of the corporate guarantee, the owner or operator would be required to place in the
facility operating record a copy of the guarantee contract and copies of all of the financial test documentation that
is required of the guarantor as specified in the corporate financial test requirements. The terms of the guarantee
contract must specify that, if the owner or operator fails to perform closure, post-closure care, or corrective action
in accordance with the requirements of part 258, the guarantor will either: (1) carry out those activities or pay the
costs of having them conducted by a third party (performance guarantee), or (2) fund a trust to pay the costs of the activities
(payment guarantee). The required documentation must be placed in the operating record, in the case of closure and
post-closure care, prior to the initial receipt of waste or the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later,
or in the case of corrective action, no later than 120 days following selection of a corrective action remedy. The financial
test documentation from the guarantor must be updated annually, in accordance with the requirements of the corporate
financial test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The financial test documentation required of the guarantor is the same as that required of a corporate financial test
user except that, in cases where the guarantor is not a corporate parent, grandparent, or sibling, the letter from
the chief financial officer must address the ``substantial business relationship'' (as defined in &sect;264.141(h))
that exists between the owner or operator and the guarantor. In particular, the letter must describe the relationship
and the consideration received from the owner or operator in exchange for the guarantee, which is necessary to ensure
that the contract is valid and enforceable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would require that guarantors agree to remain bound under this guarantee for so long as the owner or operator
must comply with the applicable financial assurance requirements of subpart G of part 258, except that guarantors
may cancel this guarantee by sending notice to the State Director and to the owner or operator. The proposal would provide
that such cancellation cannot become effective earlier than 120 days after receipt of such notice by both the State
Director and the owner or operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a guarantee is cancelled, the proposal would require the owner or operator to, within 90 days following receipt
of the cancellation notice by the owner or operator and the State Director, obtain alternate financial assurance,
place evidence of that alternate financial assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director.
If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must
provide that alternate assurance within 120 days, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility operating
record, and notify the State Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the corporate guarantor no longer meets the requirements of the financial test, the owner or operator would have
to, within 90 days following the close of the guarantor's fiscal year, obtain alternative assurance, place evidence
of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director. If the owner or operator
fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor would be required to provide
that alternate assurance within 120 days following the close of the guarantor's most recent fiscal year, place evidence
of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director.

Calculation of Obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA currently allows financial tests as mechanisms to demonstrate financial assurance for environmental obligations
under several programs. These include hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR
parts 264 and 265, petroleum underground storage tanks under 40 CFR part 280, UIC facilities under 40 CFR part 144,
and PCB commercial storage facilities under 40 CFR part 761. Under each of these programs, the Agency requires that
the owner or operator include all of the costs it is assuring through a financial test when it calculates its obligations.
This policy prevents an owner or operator from using the same assets to assure different obligations under different
programs. The Agency believes this is vital to assure the effectiveness of the financial test and assure that assets
are available to assure all of the environmental obligations covered by the test. Thus, consistent with Agency policy,
today's proposal requires a firm using a financial test for its subtitle D obligations also to include those costs
covered under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Agency programs when it calculates assured costs.

V. Domestic Asset Requirement for the Subtitle C Corporate Financial Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Agency is proposing to modify the domestic asset requirement of the current subtitle C financial test. The current
regulations at &sect;&sect;264.143(f)(1)(i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.143(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.145(f)(1)
(i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.145(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); and 265.147(f)(1) (i)(D)
and (ii)(D) require that corporations using the financial test have assets located in the U.S. amounting to at least
90% of total assets or at least six times the sum of costs assured through the financial test. The purpose of this requirement
is to assure access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. The Agency is concerned that without a domestic asset requirement,
it could experience difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms whose assets are located outside of the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Agency proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test in the July 1, 1991, notice, at 56 FR 30201,
the Agency did not propose revisions to the domestic asset requirement portion of that financial test. However, commenters
on that proposal argued that the domestic asset requirement should be revised, as it unnecessarily limits the use
of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comment received on the July 1 notice, the Agency is proposing a revised domestic asset requirement
for subtitle C. The Agency is proposing that corporations using the financial test be required to have assets in the
U.S. at least equal to the sum of all environmental obligations assured by a financial test. This approach is consistent
with the domestic asset requirement proposed in today's corporate financial test for subtitle D. The Agency solicits
comment on its proposal to modify the subtitle C domestic asset requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The discussion below describes the analysis conducted by the Agency to develop the ratio alternative, minimum net
worth requirement, and domestic asset requirement of this proposed corporate financial test. These provisions,
which are proposed in this notice for use under the subtitle D program, also were proposed by the Agency on July 1, 1991,
for use under the subtitle C program (56 FR 30201). In conducting analysis to support today's proposal, the Agency
relied in large part on analysis conducted in support of the July 1, 1991, subtitle C rulemaking. This section of the
preamble discusses the subtitle C analysis, and additional analysis conducted to support development of this proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For a more detailed description of the subtitle C analysis, the reader can refer to the preamble of the July 1, 1991,
proposal (56 FR 30201), and to the Background Document supporting the July 1 proposal, which can be found in the docket
for that rulemaking (Docket No. F&hyph;91&hyph;RCFP&hyph;FFFFF). For a more detailed description of the analysis

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First, the Agency examined whether the test should include a minimum net worth requirement. Second, the Agency developed
various financial tests and analyzed their performance in discriminating between bankrupt and viable firms. Finally,
the Agency evaluated those tests that best discriminated between viable and bankrupt firms according to a ``least
cost'' criterion, and selected a financial test. Each of these analytical steps is described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Minimum Net Worth Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In developing the subtitle C corporate financial test, the Agency determined that a minimum net worth requirement
was an important element of the test. First, the Agency was concerned that, because of their magnitude, the costs of
closure and post-closure care could themselves cause smaller firms to go bankrupt. In addition, the need for a minimum
net worth requirement was supported by analysis. The Agency found significantly higher bankruptcy rates for firms
with a net worth less than $10 million. For example, firms with less than $10 million in net worth failed four times more
frequently than firms with greater than $10 million in net worth. Based on the above, the Agency decided to propose
a minimum net worth requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the threshold for this minimum net worth requirement, the Agency analyzed public and private costs associated
with different thresholds. The Agency chose $10 million as the threshold because the analysis demonstrated that
although a higher threshold would result in savings in public costs, those savings would not offset the additional
costs to the regulated community of obtaining alternative financial assurance mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Develop and Analyze Alternative Financial Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Agency first conducted a search of financial literature and identified possible financial ratios typically
used for bankruptcy prediction. In addition to financial ratios, the Agency selected a variety of other financial
measures, such as multiples requirements for net worth and net working capital (i.e., one through six times the size
of the financial obligation) and ``additive'' requirements, which required firms to have a certain level of net worth
(in addition to the minimum net worth requirement of $10 million) based on the amount of costs they wished to cover with
the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency then evaluated the performance of these individual financial measures in discriminating between viable
and bankrupt firms. Using samples of bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms, the Agency evaluated their ability to ``pass''
non-bankrupt firms capable of meeting their financial assurance obligations, and, at the same time, ``fail'' bankrupt
firms that would enter bankruptcy without the means to meet those obligations. Each financial measure was evaluated
using two performance measures:

Those individual financial measures that performed relatively well at differentiating between the two samples
had a high differential between the availability (A) and misprediction (M) measures; i.e., they allow viable firms
to cover a relatively large percentage of obligations and, at the same time, screen out a large share of obligations
of bankrupt firms. Those measures that performed relatively poorly had about the same availability to viable firms
and bankrupt firms; i.e., they allowed bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms to cover a similar percentage of obligations.
In some cases, poorly-performing measures had a negative differential_they allowed bankrupt firms to cover a higher
percentage of obligations than non-bankrupt firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's analysis of ratio measures found that profitability ratios, which measure a firm's net income or cash
flow in relation to firm size (e.g., cash flow/total liabilities) and leverage ratios, which measure a firm's debt
in relation to firm size (i.e., total liabilities/net worth) were particularly good at discriminating between bankrupt
and non-bankrupt firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency then combined various profitability and leverage ratios, which had performed well at distinguishing
between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms, to form alternative financial tests. A variety of possible multiple and
additive requirements for net worth were then added to each combination of financial ratios.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The process described above led to the development of over 500 ``candidate'' alternative financial tests. These
candidate financial tests were then evaluated in a similar manner against the samples of bankrupt and non-bankrupt
firms to determine their ability to pass non-bankrupt firms capable of meeting their financial assurance obligations
(availability or ``A'') and their ability to screen out bankrupt firms that would enter bankruptcy without the means
to meet those obligations (misprediction or ``M''). From these candidates, ``dominant'' tests were selected, i.e.,
tests with the highest ability to pass non-bankrupt firms for given levels of bankruptcy misprediction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency then calculated the public and private cost of each ``dominant'' test. The Agency defined public costs
as the costs to the public sector of paying for financial assurance obligations for firms that pass the test but later
go bankrupt without funding their obligations, and private costs as the cost to viable firms of obtaining alternative
financial assurance mechanisms when they cannot pass the test. The amount of public and private costs associated
with a particular test depends on the test's performance in terms of its availability to viable firms and its ability
to screen out bankrupt firms.

3. Select a Financial Test for Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency then identified a set of low-cost tests, and selected a test from that group for proposal. The Agency based
its selection on policy considerations as well as the total costs of the financial tests. The Agency took this approach,
rather than select the lowest cost test, because several tests had very similar total costs but different balances
between public and private costs. Using this modified cost-effectiveness approach, the Agency was able to consider
the balance of public and private costs among tests of approximately equal total costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exhibit 1 presents total public and private costs of the top two tests identified. Test 94 was the lowest-cost test
analyzed, but the Agency proposed Test 902 in the July 1, 1991, rule for several reasons. First, Test 94 included a tax
rate adjustment (FR) in the cash flow ratio which may change over time, thus making it a more difficult test to implement
and verify. (The estimate shown in Exhibit 1 is that all firms are subject to a 34 percent corporate tax rate). In contrast,
Test 902 required a cash flow ratio adjusted by a set value of $10 million,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than by a tax adjusted cost estimate. Second, Test 902 required a net worth of $10 million plus the amount of the
cost to be assured (an additive requirement), whereas Test 94 required that the net worth be at least $10 million and
that it be at least the amount of the cost to be assured. The Agency believed that the net worth additive requirement
of Test 902 would ensure that a firm has net worth sufficient to cover its financial assurance obligations and has an
additional $10 million in net worth to cover other debts and obligations as necessary. Finally, Test 902 had a different
balance of public and private costs than Test 94. Because it is less available to firms, it had higher private costs
than Test 94. However, the substantial improvement in bankruptcy screening (lower misprediction, or ``M'') led
to far lower public costs than Test 94, so that the total costs were close to the total costs of Test 94.

The Agency analyzed many cash-flow ratios, some of which subtracted a constant amount (e.g., $5 million, $10 million,
$15 million), others of which, like the ratio in Test 94, subtracted variable amounts. Of the ratios that subtracted
a constant amount, this ratio, which subtracted $10 million, was the most effective in reducing public and private
costs.

B. The Subtitle D Corporate Financial Test Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As was discussed above, the approach used by the Agency to evaluate alternative subtitle D financial tests was consistent
with the 1991 subtitle C analysis. However, because candidate measures for the 1991 subtitle C analysis were assembled
from a thorough review of available research on bankruptcy predictors, the Agency decided that additional research
was not likely to identify any new candidate measures. Therefore, the Agency did not consider it necessary to repeat
the process of assembling and testing candidate financial measures, and combining the most promising candidate
measures into alternative financial test configurations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the Agency used the alternative financial tests identified in the subtitle C analysis as the starting point
for the subtitle D analysis. The Agency then developed firm samples and cost estimates for the subtitle D program,
and proceeded to evaluate those candidate financial tests using basically the same procedure used for subtitle C,
with minor modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Firm Samples
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Agency identified 16 non-bankrupt firms (12 public and 4 private) that own or operate MSWLFs. One of the private
firms, which appeared to be quite small, was dropped from the sample for lack of financial data. Two of the remaining
private firms were deleted because they had tangible net worth less than $10 million. The final non-bankrupt firm
sample, then, consisted of 13 firms_12 public and one private.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that the same policy considerations discussed above for subtitle C compel use of a $10 million
net worth requirement for subtitle D. In addition, the Agency conducted analysis to determine whether a lower net
worth requirement would significantly increase the amount of financial assurance that could be covered by the subtitle
D financial test. The Agency found that the 3 small firms excluded by the minimum net worth requirement owned only 12
MSWLFs, which were less than half the size of the landfills owned and operated by larger firms. Therefore, the Agency
concluded that a lower minimum net worth requirement would not significantly increase the availability of the subtitle
D corporate financial test.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The bankrupt firm sample used in the subtitle C corporate financial test analysis was also used for the subtitle D financial
test analysis. That sample consisted of 31 firms, which were either known to operate hazardous waste facilities or
were likely to do so. The Agency believed that this was the best sample of bankrupt firms available for the subtitle
D analysis for several reasons. First, owning and operating MSWLFs entails a capital-intensive, long-term investment
in engineering and construction for industrial activity, similar to the industrial activities of many firms in the
subtitle C universe. Second, firms in the MSWLF industry, like firms in the subtitle C universe, are subject to environmental
regulations and associated compliance costs. Third, the Agency could not identify bankruptcies of MSWLF firms,
as they have not been subject to Federal regulatory requirements and, therefore, have not been identified like subtitle
C facilities, which were required to notify EPA of their existence in 1980, thus providing the Agency with historical
data.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency's derived estimates of closure and post-closure care costs from data provided by the Regulatory Impacts
Analysis (RIA) of the proposed subtitle D MSWLF criteria (56 FR 50978).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the analysis predated the effective date of the landfill criteria, the Agency did not have site-specific
cost estimates for firms that own or operate MSWLFs. Therefore, the Agency estimated the financial assurance obligations
for each firm in the non-bankrupt firm sample, based on the number and size of landfills owned or operated by each firm,
and the Agency's estimate of closure and post-closure care costs per landfill.

Corrective Action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency took a different approach to analyzing the impact of corrective action costs on the performance of alternative
financial tests. As in the case of closure and post-closure care, the Agency did not have site-specific data on the
cost of corrective action. However, unlike the costs of closure and post-closure, corrective action costs are not
certain to occur. In addition to not having site-specific cost data, the Agency also did not have data on the probability
of corrective action being necessary. Therefore, the Agency did not attempt to estimate site-specific costs to analyze
the impact of corrective action costs on the performance of alternative financial tests; rather, the Agency conducted
a sensitivity analysis, which is described later in this preamble.

Note that in the 1991 subtitle C analysis, the alternative financial tests were evaluated against the firm samples
to establish a set of dominant tests, and the sum of public and private costs was then calculated for each dominant test.
However, in the subtitle D analysis, the sample size of non-bankrupt firm sample was so small (13 firms) that directly
calculating the sum of the public and private costs for each of the alternative test configurations was more analytically
efficient.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Though Test 58 was the lowest cost test, the Agency did not select it for proposal because that test did not include a
minimum net worth requirement beyond the $10 million. The Agency believes that an additional net worth requirement
that is related to the costs to be assured is important to assure that the firm's environmental costs will not increase
the probability of firm failure. For example, if a firm had a net worth of $10 million, but closure and post-closure
costs of $100 million, those costs would, in all likelihood, cause the firm to enter bankruptcy. Thus, the Agency eliminated
Test 58 from consideration and considered for proposal only those financial tests that had a minimum net worth requirement
that considered the size of the obligation to be assured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tests 562 and 130 are identical except for the minimum net worth requirement. Test 130 requires that the firm's minimum
net worth be at least $10 million and that it be at least the amount of the closure and post-closure care cost estimate.
Test 562 requires a minimum net worth be equal to $10 million plus the closure and post-closure care cost estimate.
The Agency selected Test 562 for proposal for several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Agency believes that requiring a $10 million minimum net worth requirement in addition to net worth equal
to the firm's assured costs protects against environmental obligations themselves causing bankruptcy. Second,
there was no difference in the availability of Test 130 and Test 562, so there was no compelling reason to select Test
130. Finally, selection of Test 562, which is identical to the corporate financial test proposed for subtitle C follows
the Agency's policy of maintaining consistency among programs wherever possible.

As was mentioned above, the Agency conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the costs of corrective
action would affect the performance of the candidate financial tests. This analysis evaluated the alternative tests
for closure, post-closure care, and corrective action costs under three scenarios_corrective action costs equal
to 50%, 100%, and 200% of the costs of closure and post-closure. Under each scenario, Test 130 and Test 562 were the lowest
cost tests with a minimum net worth requirement related to the size of obligation to be assured.

5. Statement of Accounting Standards Number 106 (FASB 106)

Concerns have been raised by some members of the regulated community that the December 1990 Statement issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, entitled ``Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions (OPEB)'' (FASB 106), adversely impacts their ability to pass the Agency's corporate financial test for
their environmental obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is ultimately responsible for specifying Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) for publicly-owned firms, the SEC has informally followed policies developed by the FASB, an independent
private organization that is funded by various professional accounting associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, according to FASB 106, employers who do not already account for these benefits as required by the Statement
must do so for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992 (This requirement is delayed for certain small, non-public
employers to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994). FASB 106 allows employers the option of accounting
for these benefits in one year (immediate recognition of OPEB) or over a consecutive number of years (delayed recognition
of OPEB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These members of the regulated community that are concerned about FASB 106 have requested that for Security and Exchange
Commission purposes, they be allowed to continue to use the immediate recognition method, but for purposes of the
Agency's financial test, they be allowed to use the delayed recognition method. Since both the immediate and delayed
recognition of these obligations are allowed by the FASB 106 rule, the Agency believes there is enough flexibility
in the regulations to allow recognition of OPEB benefits in the manner described above. A more detailed description
of EPA's interpretation of the federal regulations governing the corporate financial test within the context of
FASB 106 can be found in the docket in support of this proposal. (

for their environmental obligations.

6. Domestic Asset Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing that all firms using the financial test have assets in the United States at least equal to the
sum of the costs they seek to assure through the financial test. This domestic asset requirement is intended to ensure
that the Agency has access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. Without this requirement, the Agency could experience
substantial difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms that have their assets outside of the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The domestic asset requirement proposed for the subtitle D corporate owners and operators of MSWLFs is consistent
with revisions to the domestic asset requirement of the subtitle C corporate financial test proposed today (see section
V. of this preamble for further discussion).

A. Discussion of the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 16, 1990, NSWMA submitted a rulemaking petition to the Agency. The Agency has addressed many of the concerns
raised in the petition in a July 1, 1991 proposed rule (56 FR 30201) and a September 16, 1992 final rule (57 FR 42832).
While today's proposed rule addresses two more issues raised in this petition, it does not represent the full Agency
response to NSWMA's petition. The Agency continues to examine the concerns raised in NSWMA's petition.

B. The Meridian Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its analysis, the Agency evaluated the test developed by the Meridian Corporation, which was submitted
to EPA on February 16, 1990, along with a rulemaking petition, by the National Solid Wastes Management Association
(NSWMA). Using the methodology described above, the Agency found that the test was not as effective at minimizing
public and private costs as the test proposed on July 1, 1991. As a result, the Agency has not proposed the test developed
by Meridian Corporation for further analysis. The NSWMA petition, the test developed by the Meridian Corporation,
and the Agency's analysis of that test can be found in the docket in support of this proposal. The Agency will consider
and respond to any comments it receives on the Meridian financial test in evaluating the revisions to the corporate
financial test for subtitle C.

C. Request for Comment on Allowing Owners and Operators to Discount Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial assurance requirements in many EPA program areas (e.g., RCRA subtitles C and D, TSCA PCBs) require owners
and operators to calculate cost estimates in current dollars, and aggregate these estimates (even though these costs
may be incurred many years in the future). Owners must obtain a financial responsibility instrument for at least the
amount of this aggregated cost estimate. The RCRA regulations currently do not allow owners and operators to adjust
this aggregated cost estimate to reflect the fact that these activities are scheduled to occur in future years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has received many requests to allow owners and operators to meet the financial assurance requirements
based on the present value of these future obligations. In a rulemaking petition submitted on February 16, 1990, the
National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) recommended that the Agency allow firms to use a present value
based on a discount rate to estimate their costs for post-closure care and for the extended care portion of corrective
action. (The NSWMA petition can be found in the docket of today's rulemaking.) In addition, the Agency has received
public comment making similar requests during the development of other financial-responsibility-related rules.
In the preamble to the proposed local government financial test, the Agency solicited comment on the whether to allow
owners and operators to discount costs associated with MSWLFs (see 58 FR 68353 at 68361, December 27, 1993). The Agency
recognizes that this is an issue of interest to many parties, and has reviewed and considered all comments received
to date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the argument presented to the Agency has been, because these expenditures are scheduled to occur in the
future (often many years in the future), a financial instrument for less than the aggregate costs (i.e. the ``present
value'' of the aggregated costs) would pay off these expenditures in the future.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is the case because there is a time dimension to the value of a monetary or financial instrument_$100 in hand today
is worth more than a (guaranteed) promise to pay $100 in ten years. One hundred dollars invested today, for example,
in a ten-year Treasury bond paying at an interest rate of 7 percent will pay back $197 ten years from now, assuming that
interest is compounded continually.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to make comparisons between alternative financial instruments on capital investment decisions involving
different streams of payments over time, financial analysts, economists, etc., calculate the ``present value''
of the alternatives. This method involves calculating in terms of current dollars using the interest rate_or discount
rate_present value of a promised future receipt (or expenditure). For example, at a 7 percent interest rate, an investor
would be indifferent between receiving $100 five years from now or receiving $71.30 today. The present value, then
of the promise to pay $100 in five years (at a discount rate of 7 percent) would be $71.30. In much the same way, if the Agency
allowed owners and operators to discount their future costs when they demonstrated financial responsibility, an
owner or operator who had a $10 million closure scheduled to occur 20 years in the future could demonstrate financial
responsibility for as little as $2.6 million today, assuming they could invest that amount at the same 7% interest
(or discount ) rate described above. The effect of discounting becomes more pronounced as the time period and discount
rate increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has not proposed to allow owners and operators to discount costs because the Agency remains unconvinced
that by doing so it would assure that adequate funds will be available in a timely manner to perform required activities
in the event that the owner or operator is unable or unwilling to perform these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Agency is concerned that for an approach based on discounting to be effective, it is important that the owner
or operator be able to predict with certainty when the costs will incur. For example, an owner or operator who estimates
that the closure costs of its MSWLF will be $10 million to occur 20 years in the future would only have to demonstrate
financial responsibility for $2.6 million today, assuming a 7 percent discount rate. If that MSWLF unexpectedly
has to close, it may not have sufficient resources to properly complete all closure activities since the amount of
financial responsibility could be substantially less than the actual need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these concerns, the Agency is interested in allowing owners and operators to discount costs under the subtitle
D program wherever it can do so and still assure that sufficient resources will be available to perform required activities.
The Agency believes that discounting may be more applicable for some activities than others. For example, where the
cost of an activity is known, the timing of the activity can be predicted with a greater degree of certainty, or where
the activity takes place over an extended time period, it may be appropriate to discount costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although current regulations require owners to have the financial resources to carry out all closure and post-closure
activities in one year, some activities, such as post-closure groundwater monitoring, can only be done over several
decades. Therefore, even if a landfill must close unexpectedly, certain activities (like post-closure care) and
the associated costs will still occur over a number of years in the future. EPA could allow owners to discount these
costs in computing their obligations. However, where the timing and costs associated with an activity are not known,
discounting may not be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of its interest in allowing owners and operators to discount costs, and because of its concerns about allowing
them to do so, the Agency again solicits comment on the practice of discounting, and how it might be applied to the subtitle
D program. Members of the public who submitted comments on discounting during the comment period of the local government
financial test need not submit those comments again. If the Agency modifies the subtitle D regulations to allow owners
and operators to discount costs under that program, the Agency will consider all comments related to discounting
that were submitted to the docket for this proposal during the public comment period and to the docket for the local
government financial test proposal during the comment period for that rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency specifically requests comment and supporting information on the following and on any other issues that
commenters identify regarding discounting for MSWLF financial responsibility requirements:

VIII. State Program Approval_Subtitle D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4005(c) of RCRA requires that each State adopt and implement a ``permit program or other system of prior approval
and conditions'' adequate to assure that each facility that may receive household hazardous waste or small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised MSWLF criteria. Each state must adopt and implement a permit program
not later than 18 months after October 9, 1991. EPA is required to ``determine whether each State has developed an adequate
program'' pursuant to section 4005(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA plans to propose a State/Tribal implementation rule which will establish adequacy determination requirements
and procedures for State subtitle D permit programs, including submission of a MSWLF permit program application.
EPA also plans to propose to extend eligibility for subtitle D permit program approval to Indian Tribes. The statute,
however, does not require these rules to be in place before EPA assesses the adequacy of any State or Tribal program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of these rules, the Agency plans to include procedures for submitting revised applications for State and Tribal
program adequacy determinations should a State or Tribe revise its permit program once deemed adequate and the appropriate
Regional Administrator determines that a revised application is necessary. Program revision may be necessary when
the pertinent Federal statutory or regulatory authority is changed, when State or Tribal statutory or regulatory
authority or relevant guidance changes, or when responsibility for the State or Tribal program is shifted within
the lead agency or to a new or different State or Tribal agency or agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State or Tribe that receives permit program approval prior to the final promulgation of today's rule and later elects
to adopt the financial test and local government guarantee mechanisms should work with its respective Regional EPA
office as it proceeds to make changes to its permit program. EPA does not interpret the statute to require that each
and every program change a State or Tribe makes will require a revised permit program application. Rather, only certain
changes that raise issues warranting a detailed review by EPA and an opportunity for public comment will necessitate
a revised application. EPA believes that State and Tribal compliance with today's proposal will, in most cases, not
require a revised permit program application, since this rule merely provides additional options for demonstrating
financial assurance. Furthermore, States and Tribes that have adopted financial assurance requirements without
this local government test and guarantee are not required to take any action and may elect to retain only their current
options since this proposal simply expands the number of options available to owners and operators for demonstrating
financial assurance.

IX. Implementation_Subtitle D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, today's proposal would amend part 258 by adding additional options for corporations to use when demonstrating
financial assurance for the costs of closure, post-closure care and clean-up of known releases. States and Tribes
will not be required to include these options in their MSWLF programs, since they may choose to establish their own
financial assurance programs as long as they meet the financial assurance requirements in Federal criteria. EPA
will be able to approve the financial assurance portion of a State or Tribe's program so long as it includes at least
one of the options promulgated in October, 1991, or added by today's proposal (if promulgated).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a matter of Federal law, these proposed tests (if promulgated) will be potentially available in all States and all
Tribal jurisdictions. EPA cautions owners and operators that wish to use the options in the Federal program that they
should look at the options available under State or Tribal law. If the State or Tribe's rules do not include the option
that the owner or operator wishes to use, the owner or operator would run the risk of being out of compliance with State
or Tribal law. State and Tribal laws for MSWLFs are fully effective even when not approved by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In unapproved States or Tribes, if State or Tribal law did not preclude the use of options proposed today (either because
it did not include any financial assurance requirements, included only a general requirement that left the choice
of mechanism to the discretion of the owner or operator, or included mechanisms resembling those proposed today)
an owner or operator would be able to use the corporate test or guarantee described in today's proposal (if promulgated)
to satisfy both State or Tribal and Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that States or Tribes seeking approval for the financial assurance portion of their MSWLF program or wishing
to modify an already approved program would have flexibility in adopting Federally promulgated standards. The State
or Tribe could simply adopt the Federal standard or could adopt a mechanism that meets the five performance standards
detailed in the October 9, 1991 final criteria rule. In this case, the mechanism could be used by owners or operators
for demonstrating financial responsibility for their MSWLF obligations in that State or Tribe. The five criteria
that the financial mechanism would need to meet are the following: (1) Ensure that the amount of funds assured is sufficient
to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases when needed; (2) ensure
that funds will be available in a timely fashion when needed; (3) guarantee the availability of the required amount
of coverage from the effective date of these requirements or prior to the initial receipt of waste, whichever is later,
until the owner or operator is released from financial assurance requirements under &sect;&sect;253.32 (f), (g),
(h); (4) provide flexibility to the owner or operator for demonstrating compliance with financial assurance requirements;
and (5) be legally valid, binding, and enforceable under State and Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, while the Agency is developing financial tests that are designed to meet these performance criteria (the
financial test proposed in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the financial test proposed on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68353)), approved States and Tribes could develop their
own financial tests that could be used by owners and operators of MSWLFs within those States and Tribes for demonstrating
financial responsibility as long as those tests are determined to have met the performance standards. (For a discussion
of the effect of EPA's approval of a State or Tribal program on the Federal regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
56 FR 50995.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners and operators who can use the options in today's proposal under State or Tribal law would be required to maintain
appropriate documentation of the mechanism in the facility's operating record. They would not be required by Federal
law to submit that documentation to the State or Tribe, but only to notify the State or Tribal Director that the required
items have been placed in the operating record. Owners and operators using the financial test or guarantee would also
be required to update all required financial test information on an annual basis, and retain this information in their
operating records. In addition, an owner or operator (or guarantor) that becomes unable to meet the financial test
criteria would be required to notify the State or Tribal Director and establish alternate financial assurance within
specified deadlines. Finally, in order to cancel a guarantee, the guarantor would have to notify both the State or
Tribal Director and the owner or operator at least 120 days prior to cancellation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that most Tribes have an accounting structure similar or identical to those of most local governments.
Tribes that meet the requirements of the local government financial test would be eligible to use that financial test
to demonstrate financial responsibility for their subtitle D obligations to the extent that they meet the provisions
of that test. However, the Agency recognizes that there may be Tribes and local government units that use an accounting
system similar or identical to those of most corporations. Those Tribes and local government units would be eligible
to use this proposed corporate financial test to demonstrate financial responsibility for their subtitle D obligations
to the extent that they meet the requirements of this proposal.

X. State Authorization_Subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1991, the Agency proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test (56 FR 30201). In that proposal,
the Agency considered the effect of those proposed revisions on State Authorization based on the entire test, rather
than on the individual components of the entire financial test (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
56 FR 30214 and 30215). This proposal would modify one provision of that July 1, 1991 proposed rule. Specifically,
this proposal would modify the domestic assets requirement of the financial test contained in &sect;&sect;264.143(f)(1)
(i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.143(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.145(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.145(e)(1) (i)(D)
and (ii)(D); 264.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); and 265.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D) and the corresponding revisions
to the financial test instruments at &sect;264.151 (f) and (g). This proposed change of the domestic asset requirement
would not change the effect of State Authorization detailed in the July 1, 1991 proposed rule. As a result, if the Agency
does promulgate a revised financial test under subtitle C, the effect on State Authorization would be based on the
July 1, 1991 proposal, though a full discussion of the effect on State Authorization of the entire revised subtitle
C corporate financial test will be contained in the final rule.

 58 FR 51735), the Agency must determine whether a regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to
OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one
that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or Tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory action''
within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response
to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record for this rulemaking (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency conducted an analysis to estimate the costs that would be avoided by corporations if this corporate financial
test were available to them. Since corporations would be able to use the financial test for all or part of their subtitle
D obligations, corporations would save the cost of obtaining a third-party instrument for those portions of their
obligations. The Agency estimates that the corporate financial test and guarantee mechanisms would save corporations
$45 million annually. In performing this analysis, the Agency assumed that the 1991 data used to estimate the number
of MSWLFs, the costs of closure and post-closure care for each of the categories of MSWLFs, and the number of corporations
are held constant. The financial data of the corporations are also assumed not to have changed since 1991. The Agency
also assumed that corporations had, as their only environmental obligations, the costs of closure, post-closure
care of their MSWLFs. The Agency further assumed that the cost of obtaining a third-party financial instrument, such
as a letter of credit or surety bond, would be 1.5 percent of the cost estimate of closure and post-closure care of the
MSWLF. Finally, the Agency assumed that corporate parents would be willing to provide guarantees to their subsidiaries
to the extent that they are able to provide those guarantees through the financial test. A full discussion of this analysis
can be found in the docket for this rulemaking.

The Agency believes that the information it had when it performed its analysis was the most current and the most complete
at the time. While the Agency recognizes that changes have occurred in the subtitle D universe since 1991, it does not
have information to quantify these changes. As a result, the Agency solicits the public for more current information
that can be used to update its analysis. Further, the Agency solicits comment on the assumptions made in order to perform
the analysis and solicits the public for information that supports or refutes these assumptions. A detailed analysis
of the cost savings associated with this rule is available in the docket.

 at the time an Agency publishes a proposed or final rule, it generally must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
that describes the impact of the rule on small entities, unless the Administrator certifies that the rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Agency is aware of three companies
that would be excluded from using this proposed financial test because their net worth is less than $10 million. Therefore,
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605b, we believe that this regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

 and assigned OMB control number 2050&hyph;0122. The burden estimate for the MSWLF financial assurance provisions
included the burden associated with a landfill obtaining and maintaining any one of the allowable financial assurance
instruments, including a financial test. The proposed revision to part 264 does not change the recordkeeping or reporting
requirements for subtitle C facilities. The information collection requirements for financial assurance of subtitle
C facilities are discussed and approved under OMB control number 2050&hyph;0120.

adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Director
of an approved State may evaluate qualified opinions on a case by case basis and allow use of the financial test in cases

must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also
the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the owner
or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraph (e) of this section and
must comply with the terms of the guarantee. A certified copy of the guarantee must be placed in the facility's operating
record along with copies of the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer and accountants' opinions as
specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation
of the owner or operator, the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer must describe the value received
in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the
owner or operator, this letter must describe this ``substantial business relationship'' and the value received
in consideration of the guarantee.

(payment guarantee). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends prior notice of cancellation by certified mail
to the owner or operator and to the State Director. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning
on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the State Director, as evidenced
by the return receipts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) If a guarantee is cancelled, the owner or operator must, within 90 days following receipt of the cancellation
notice by the owner or operator and the State Director, obtain alternate financial assurance, place evidence of that
alternate financial assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director. If the owner or operator
fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate
assurance within 120 days, obtain alternative assurance, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility
operating record, and notify the State Director.

 (4) If a corporate guarantor no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator
must, within 90 days following the close of the guarantor's fiscal year, obtain alternative assurance, place evidence
of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director. If the owner or operator
fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate
assurance within 120 days following the close of the guarantor's fiscal year, obtain alternative assurance, place
evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director.

<SUMMARY>

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations incorporate additional statutory disregards in the rules for the Aid to Families With
Dependent Children (AFDC) program and the adult assistance programs in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
Included is the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993, which amends section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. This income disregard is effective January 1, 1994. This
amendment provides that up to $2,000 per year of income derived from interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted
lands shall not be considered in determining assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally
assisted program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, we propose to incorporate the resource disregard provided under section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134,
as added by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458, effective January 12, 1983. This provision requires that interests of
individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a resource in determining eligibility for
assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally assisted program.

Disregard of Certain Income Derived From Interests of Individual Indians in Trust or Restricted Lands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Effective January 1, 1994, section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, amends
section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134 to provide that up to $2,000 per year of amounts derived from interests of individual
Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be counted as income. The Conference Report identifies ``leases on
individually-owned trust or restricted Indian lands'' as such interests [H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111, 103D Cong.,
1st Sess., 494&hyph;495 (1993)]. The income generally comes from interests in lands allotted to individual Indians
many years ago. Income to individual Indians generated by these interests is likely to be quite small because many
of the original interests is allotted lands have fractionized over time due to the inheritance of multiple heirs over
several generations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, the disregard of up to $2,000 per year would be applicable only to income. Any disregarded
amounts retained by an individual after the month in which they are received would be counted as a resource. We also
propose to give States the flexibility to define the yearly period for applying the income disregard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 233.20 would be amended by redesignating paragraph (a)(4)(i) as (a)(4)(i)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and adding a new paragraph (a)(4)(i)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to incorporate the income disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Disregard of Individual Indian Interests in Trust or Restricted Lands From Consideration as a Resource
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 93&hyph;134, enacted October 19, 1973, provides for the use or distribution of certain Indian judgment
funds. Public Law 97&hyph;458, enacted January 12, 1983, made several amendments to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. One amendment
made by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458 was the addition of a new section 8 to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. Section 8 of Pub. L.
93&hyph;134 requires that interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a
resource in determining eligibility for assistance under the Social Security Act of any other Federal or federally
assisted program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this provision was effective in 1983, it was not incorporated in the regulations at that time because it was
considered unnecessary. Interests in trust or restricted lands are not considered a resource under the definition
of available income and resources in existing regulations at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D). These regulations provide,
in pertinent part, that income and resources are considered available both when actually available and when the applicant
or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support
and maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, we now propose to incorporate the resource disregard in order to prevent any confusion that may result were
we to incorporate only the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. Therefore, we would
further amend section 233.20 by adding paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
v
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to incorporate the resource disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as added by section 4 of Pub. L.
97&hyph;458.

Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total Federal and State cost for implementing this statutory amendment is estimated to be $10.6 million for the
first full year with $5.8 million (55.2%) of this amount being the Federal share. Assuming that the number of additional
Indian families becoming eligible for AFDC after the first year is an added 10 percent, then an added cost of $0.6 million
is estimated for a total Federal cost of $6.4 million. These costs result from the statutory requirements and not from
decisions made in the proposed rule.

We certify that these regulations will not have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
they primarily affect State governments and individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided
in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adopted this Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) to make minor modifications to its procedural rules
governing informal complaints against common carriers and to seek comment on the proposed rules. The NPRM proposes
rules that would modify certain filing and notice requirements and clarifies the role of carriers in informal complaint
proceedings. These proposals are intended to help the general public in preparing written informal complaints,
improve the procedure by which informal complaints are handled by the staff, harness staff resources to resolve informal
complaints more efficiently, and eliminate unnecessary filings of formal complaints prior to the disposition of
informal complaints.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in CC Docket No. 94&hyph;93 (FCC 94&hyph;211),
adopted August 11, 1994, and released September 2, 1994.

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On August 11, 1994, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in CC Docket No. 94&hyph;93 (released
September 2, 1994: FCC 94&hyph;211) in order to make minor modifications to our procedural rules governing informal
complaints against carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The NPRM proposes to amend &sect;1.716 to clarify that informal complaints may be filed against common carriers
for violations of the Commission's rules or orders as well as the Communications Act. This proposal is intended to
conform &sect;1.716 to Section 208 of the Communications Act. The NPRM also proposes to amend &sect;1.716 to require
specifically that informal complaints include factual allegations that, if assumed to be true, would support a finding
that the subject carrier has violated a provision of the Communications Act or Commission rules or orders. This proposal
should provide helpful guidance to the general public in preparing written informal complaints, enable FCC staff
to assess the merits of complaints more quickly, and aid carriers in their efforts to answer or satisfy informal complaints.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In addition, the NPRM proposes to amend &sect;1.716 to add a new subsection (b) to encourage complainants to file
both an original informal complaint as well as one copy for each carrier named in their informal complaints. The NPRM
also proposes to amend &sect;1.716 by adding subsection (c) which would encourage complainants to file a copy of the
pertinent bill(s) when the complaint involves a billing dispute. Multiple copies of informal complaints are intended
to reduce the clerical burden in preparing complaints for processing. In addition, encouraging complainants to
file a copy of pertinent bills should enable the Commission to reassign substantial resources from administrative
functions to enforcement functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The NPRM also proposes to amend &sect;1.717 to conform the rules to Commission practices. Specifically, the NPRM
clarifies that the function of carriers in informal complaint proceedings is to satisfy or answer written allegations
contained in a complaint. In addition, the NPRM proposes to eliminate the Commission's discretion to close certain
informal complaints without further contact with the carrier and the complainant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Finally, the NPRM proposes to amend &sect;1.718 to state that in all cases involving an unsatisfied informal complaint,
the period of time allowed for filing a formal complaint that will relate back to the filing date of the informal complaint
is sixty days after the staff has informed the parties in writing of its disposition of the informal complaint. The
proposal is intended to eliminate the need for complainants to calculate the deadline for filing formal complaints
based on unsatisfied informal complaints and relieve the burden on carriers of determining when they may dispose
of informal complaint files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, it is certified that the proposed rule will not,
if promulgated, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by Section
601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Although the proposed rules change the timing and mechanics of the informal
complaint process, they would not alter the level of evidentiary and legal support required of parties to such actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. This notice and comment rule making procedure is nonrestricted. Section 1.1206(a) of the Commission's Rules,
47 CFR 1.1206(a), contains provisions governing permissible

making is issued, proposing the amendment of 47 CFR part 1 as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. It is further ordered, pursuant to &sect;&sect;1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.415, 1.419,
that all interested parties may file comments on the matters discussed in the Notice and on the proposed rules as set
forth below by October 24, 1994 and reply comments by November 8, 1994. All relevant and timely comments will be considered
by the Commission before final action is taken in this proceeding. To file formally in this proceeding, participants
must file an original and four copies of all comments, reply comments, and supporting comments. If participants wish
each Commissioner to have a personal copy of their comments, an original plus nine copies must be filed. Comments and
reply comments should be sent to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC
20554. Comments and reply comments will be available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Dockets
Reference Room (room 230) of the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20554.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commonwealth of Kentucky, lead State for the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Program, and Heavy Vehicle Electronic License
Plate, Inc. (HELP) have requested, and the FHWA proposes to grant, a petition for a waiver from the requirements of
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to allow the use of an automatic vehicle identification (AVI)
transponder to be mounted near the upper border at the approximate center of the windshields of commercial motor vehicles.
The FHWA proposes to grant the waiver to allow the use of the transponders in a maximum of 30,000 commercial motor vehicles
participating in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 ``beta tests'' and the HELP corridor programs during a 3-year period, subject
to the proposed conditions described in this notice.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) are required to stop at highway ports of entry (POE), weigh stations, and other checkpoints
to be weighed and to have their regulatory credentials (e.g., registration, operating permits) checked by State
officials. A CMV may be stopped many times in the course of a single trip. Each stop can add a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes
to the length of a trip because of the time needed to decelerate, stop, be weighed, have paperwork reviewed, undergo
a safety inspection, reenter the highway, and accelerate to mainline speed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CMVs that are in compliance with safety and size and weight regulations and have their administrative paperwork in
order have an opportunity to greatly increase inspection efficiency and effectiveness. Information on the status
of a CMV's registration, safety inspection, and operating permits, can be encoded and transmitted to the POE as an
electronic signal via an automatic vehicle identification (AVI) transponder carried in the CMV. The POE's receiver
would decode the signal, and officials would review the CMV's status on the spot. Drivers whose CMVs' safety status
or administrative records needed to be reviewed would receive a signal to enter the POE or weigh station. Drivers whose
CMVs are in compliance may receive a signal to bypass the site. However, they may still be required to enter for a safety
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outcome would be a more selective review process which would enable POE officials to focus their resources to deal
with vehicles with safety and size and weight infractions or vehicles that are not in compliance with other administrative
requirements. Use of AVI transponders would also provide economic benefits by saving motor carriers time, improving
the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement, reducing paperwork, and increasing uniformity of enforcement.
Environmental benefits would be gained from fuel savings and reduced CMV emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goals of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and the HELP programs are to reduce congestion, increase efficiency, and enhance
the safety of users of major highway corridors through the application of a network of advanced highway, vehicle,
and communications technologies. Both programs are multi-State partnerships of public and private sector interests.
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, currently in progress, and HELP/CRESCENT, completed in late 1993, were two of the first in a
planned series of operational tests within the Commercial Vehicle Operations (CVO) element of the Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) Program (formerly known as the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) program). HELP builds on
the foundation of the multistate, multinational CRESCENT research effort to design and test a heavy vehicle monitoring
system that integrates automatic vehicle identification, classification, and weigh-in-motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP programs will allow CMVs which are equipped with transponders, and which are in compliance
with safety and administrative requirements, to travel any segment of their respective instrumented highways at
mainline speeds with minimal stopping at weight/inspection checkpoints. For ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, electronic
clearance decisions at points along the corridor will be based on the information obtained at the point on the corridor
where the vehicle first enters, as well as on computerized checking of operating credentials and safety records in
each State. For HELP, the electronic clearance decisions will be based on data collected from weigh-in-motion devices
embedded in the mainline highway pavement or on bypass ramps, as well as on computerized checking of operating credentials
and safety records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 covers the entire length of I&hyph;75 and Canadian Highway 401 (Ontario). The HELP/CRESCENT
demonstration operated along the I&hyph;5 and I&hyph;10 corridors in several western States from Washington to
Texas. Under HELP, the former CRESCENT highway corridors are being expanded to include segments in Utah and Colorado.

AVI Device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AVI device proposed for use in both programs is an electronic transponder designed to send and receive signals
from a CMV to POEs and safety inspection sites. The signals contain information such as the identity of the motor carrier,
the gross weight of the vehicle, and the status of the vehicle's registration and fuel tax payments. The transponder
only transmits when it is in the immediate vicinity of a licensed transmitter and is directed to do so by that licensed
transmitter under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
47 CFR 90.239. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an inspection official decides whether the vehicle should enter or bypass the POE, a signal is transmitted from
the official's workstation to the CMV. This is displayed to the CMV driver in the form of a clearly visible signal from
red and green lamps on the transponder's face. The transponder also provides an audible signal to the driver. The transponder
measures 3.3 inches (84 mm) high by 4.4 inches (112 mm) wide by 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to function effectively, the transponder must be able properly to transmit and receive signals from the POE.
The physical location of the transponder is a critical factor in its operation because CMVs are equipped with many
other devices that transmit and receive electronic signals of varying strengths and frequencies, such as electronic
engine monitors and citizens-band radios which could affect the transponder's transmissions. In addition to these
internally-generated signals, there is also a possibility of external interference from electrical power transmission
lines running along highway rights-of-way. Furthermore, the device must be placed to allow drivers to read the enter/bypass
indication displayed on the transponder so they can respond appropriately.

Documentation of Device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AVI transponder is clearly labelled in its lower right-hand quadrant, on the side facing the driver, with the name
of the respective issuing program (``ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Driver Communications Module'' and ``PRE-PASS, a transportation
solution from HELP, Inc.''). Two indicators, a red octagonal mark labeled ``STOP'' and a green upward-pointing arrow
labeled ``GO,'' also appear on that side. A nine-pin RS&hyph;232 connector, not used for either the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75
or the HELP application, is on the bottom of the transponder. The device is thus readily identifiable as a transponder
issued by one of the two programs, and no additional documentation need be carried on the participating CMVs. The transponder's
unique configuration and marking distinguish it from other electronic devices, such as radar detectors.

A foundation reference for defining the ergonomic basis for cab design is ``Motor Vehicle Driver's Eye Range,'' SAE
Recommended Practice (RP) J941, which establishes two-dimensional ``Eyellipses'' representing the 90th, 95th,
and 99th percentile distributions of driver eye locations for use in the design of the passenger cars, trucks, buses,
and multipurpose passenger vehicles. This RP was initially approved in October 1965, and completely revised in October
1985. It has been recognized as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
A method for describing and measuring the driver's direct and indirect field of view, presented in SAE RP J1050a, references
RP J941. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniform test procedures for minimum performance of windshield wiper systems for trucks, buses, and multipurpose
vehicles are established in SAE RP J198. This RP also references RP J941 for a statistical representation of the driver's
eye location, except for head-turn considerations. The RP states that the specific areas on the windshield glazing
surface ``were developed as being compatible with viewing requirements necessary to operate the types of vehicles
listed in Table 1 [of the RP]''. The classification lists seven different types of vehicles, and the corresponding
areas described by the intersections of planes defined by angles above, below, left, and right of the horizontal axis
of the Eyellipse. The RP defines 3 areas: a central zone, Area C, an intermediate zone, Area B, and an outer zone, Area
A; all are delimited by the angles listed in Table 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``angle up'' for the outer zone of the windshield, Area A, ranges from 10 degrees for a cab-behind-engine configuration
with the ground-to-H-point

 dimension of between 0 and 40 inches (0 to 1016 mm) to 5 degrees for a configuration with a ground-to-hinge-point dimension
of 50 inches (1270 mm) or greater. Angles-up for Area A in other trucks, buses, and multipurpose vehicles listed ranges
from 6 to 8 degrees. Angles-up for Areas B and C range from 1 to 5 degrees.

The upper, lower, extreme left, and extreme right borders of the windshield are outside areas A, B, and C. The minimum
percentage of required wiped area described in the RP decreases from the central to the outer zones. If installed as
proposed, that is, within the upper windshield border, the transponder should be located well outside Areas A, B,
and C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed transponder location would be near the top center of a one-piece windshield or on the passenger side of
a multipiece windshield. This would place it well outside the area swept by wipers pivoting from below the windshield.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAE RP J382, Windshield Defrosting Systems Performance Guidelines_Trucks, Buses, and Multi-Purpose Vehicles,
provides a defrosting system performance guideline. Among other things, it notes that the windshield area to be defrosted
``was developed to be compatible with vision requirements necessary to operate trucks, buses, and multi passenger
vehicles.'' This windshield area is based on SAE RP J941, March 1981 (Eyellipse), and SAE RP J826, April 1980 (Devices
for Use in Defining and Measuring Vehicle Seating Accommodation). In a fashion similar to RP 198, this RP defines two
areas: a central zone, Area C, and a surrounding zone, Area A. Angles up, down, left, and right are also defined, as in
RP 198. The upper, lower, extreme left, and extreme right borders of the windshield are outside both of these areas.
If installed as proposed, that is, within the upper windshield border, the transponder should be located well outside
Areas A and C, as defined in this RP.

Two Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) incorporate SAE Recommended Practices similar to those discussed

Car Windshield Defrosting Systems. FMVSS 104, Windshield wiping and washing systems, references SAE RP J903a, Passenger
Car Windshield Wiper Systems. Both of the FMVSSs apply to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks,
and buses. (While the FMVSSs themselves have this broad range of applicability, they do not reference the truck and
bus versions of the SAE RPs.)

Research on Driver's Field of View 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four recent research papers discuss the issue of a driver's useful field of view (FOV). The first, ``A Study of Driver's
Forward Fields of Direct View for Large Trucks,'' (N. Nagaike and Y. Hoshino, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
JSAE Review,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 January 1989, pages 74&hyph;76), reviewed factors governing the visible area directly ahead of large trucks. The
research determined necessary visibility areas, depicted by vertical and lateral angles in a driver's forward field
of view. Factors for determining these areas included locations of traffic lights and directional signs, the driver's
ability to recognize stationary and moving objects, and the braking deceleration of large trucks. Data were collected
from traffic accident records in Japan and from direct observation. While the visible area for traffic signals and
road signs was recorded at angles above the driver's eye level, stationary objects, moving objects in the vicinity
of intersections, and oncoming vehicles and vehicles in front of the CMV were shown to be located in visible areas below
the driver's eye level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second paper, ``Research on Forward Field of View of Trucks,'' (Y. Siosaka and N. Nagaike, 14th Annual Technical
Conference on Enhanced Safety of Vehicles, Munich, Germany, May 1994), presented a study undertaken to determine
the minimum forward field of view required for driving in a straight line, in order more clearly to define the area swept
by windshield wipers. Data on braking distance and merging behavior (specifically, gap acceptance) were collected
from drivers driving on Japanese rural roads, urban streets, and expressways. The results indicated a ``driveable
field of view'' extending from 5 degrees above horizontal to 5 degrees below horizontal, referenced to the driver's
eye point centerline.

Design conflicts between the need for driver visual perspective and windshield optical distortion were examined
by Makiguchi, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (``A Human Factors Analysis of Optical Distortion for Automotive Windshields,'' SAE Paper 940390, 1994). Field
data were gathered during straight-line driving. Based on drivers' fixation frequency and the type of objects observed,
the windshield was divided into four zones. The G1 zone, with the highest fixation frequency, extended 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 17 degrees laterally and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 8 degrees vertically from the driver's line of sight. It included crucial driving information, such as pedestrians,
road signs and signals, and oncoming and nearby vehicles. The fixation frequency was reported as exceeding 95 percent.
The G3 and G4 zones, with the lowest fixation frequencies, were noted at approximately 100 to 200 mm from the edge of
the windshield's visible area. Drivers observe pedestrians and buildings in the zone below 8 degrees horizontal;
in the zone above 8 degrees horizontal, they see the sky. A zone of middle fixation frequency, G2, was defined as the
area outside the G1, G3, and G4 zones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety published a report on accidents in four urban areas arising in
part from visibility problems in heavy trucks (``A Study of Fatal Crashes Involving Pedestrians and Trucks in Four
Cities,'' December 1992). It noted, ``Obstruction of truck driver visibility, caused by the design of truck/tractor
cabs, appears to be a major contributing factor in crashes at intersections.'' However, the discussion of accident
data did not differentiate between conventional_cab behind engine_and cab-over-engine tractor involvement.
The report did not mention decals or other items in CMV windshields as a potential concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the reports on these studies, the FHWA believes that the location of a transponder device near the
upper margin of a CMV's windshield is unlikely to have any effect on a driver's ability to observe nearby objects, such
as pedestrians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Relationship to Sunvisors, Sunshades, and Rear-View Mirrors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interior sunvisors are standard equipment in virtually every vehicle on the road today. Exterior sunshades are available
as optional accessories from several truck manufacturers. Sunvisors are not regulated by an FMVSS or an FMCSR, nor
is there an SAE Recommended Practice concerning their design. Sunvisors are not believed to have a detrimental effect
on a driver's safety-related vision. On the contrary, blocking the sun's glare offers a clear safety benefit, and
the loss of a small visible area of the windshield, well outside the range of the driver's field of view, is considered
an acceptable tradeoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data obtained on 33 models of new Class 8 tractor cabs, representing all seven of the major manufacturers serving the
U.S. market, indicate that sunvisors vary from 5.25 to 7.5 inches in height and 19.75 to 34 inches in length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that the AVI transponder proposed to be used in ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP is roughly 2 inches smaller
than the smallest sunvisor (which was only found on one cab model). The agency therefore believes that a transponder
mounted within the region of the windshield that the sunvisor would cover would be extremely unlikely to have an adverse
effect on safety. The audible indicator that accompanies the visible signal for the driver to enter or to bypass a POE
would provide the necessary information in the event that a sunvisor were to block the driver's view of the transponder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For windshields equipped with exterior sunshades, the transponder is likely to fall at or above the portion of the
underside of the sunshade visible from the cab interior. Furthermore, while exterior sunshades may limit the uppermost
range of the driver's available field of view, that area is also well out of the useful field of view as reported by the
research cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also notes that the AVI transponder would be located in approximately the same relative position in the
windshield of a CMV as that of a rear-view mirror in a passenger car. The agency believes that the transponder would
have no more impact on safety than the presence of such a mirror and its mounting.

History: Rule on Vision-Reducing Matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 393.60(c) of the FMCSRs requires that no motor vehicle be operated with any label, sticker, decalcomania,
or other vision-reducing matter covering any portion of its windshield or windows at either side of the driver's compartment,
except that stickers required by law may be affixed to the bottom of the windshield, provided that no portion of any
label, sticker, decalcomania, or other vision-reducing matter may extend upward more than 4.5 inches from the bottom
of the windshield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulation dealing with Glazing and Window Construction, issued by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC) in 1952 [54 Motor Carrier Cases 337, 7 FR 4422, May 15, 1952], required that glazing in specified openings conform
to the requirements contained in the ``American Standard Safety Code for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor
Vehicles Operating on Land Highways, Z26.1 1950'' of the American Standards Association, now called the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI). (The Table of Glazing Requirements, contained in &sect;393.60(a)(2) of the
FMCSRs, requires CMVs manufactured on and after January 1, 1981, to comply with Z26.1&hyph;1966 as supplemented
by Z26.1a-1969.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1958 (23 FR 9608, December 11, 1958), the ICC proposed to amend this rule, then codified at 49 CFR &sect;193.60,
by adding paragraphs covering windshield condition (&sect;193.60(b)) and use of vision-reducing matter (&sect;193.60(c)).
The latter paragraph prohibited the use of vision-reducing matter covering any portion of a motor vehicle's windshield
or windows at either side of the driver's compartment, ``except 1 vehicle-inspection sticker issued by a State or
municipal authority, which shall be no larger than 3 inches by 5 inches and shall be located in the lower right-hand
corner of the windshield.'' The ICC invited comment, but did not publish a report on this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1959 (24 FR 9674), the ICC adopted a final rule amending &sect;193.60(c) to remove the maximum dimension
requirement for the sticker while setting a limit of one sticker indicating compliance with official mechanical
inspection requirements of the State in which the title or certificate of ownership is registered. The permissible
location was changed to ``a lower corner of the windshield.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of &sect;193.60(c) was amended again on April 19, 1961 (26 FR 3309), based on petitions for reconsideration
from the Virginia State Police, the New York State Public Service Commission, and the American Association of Motor
Vehicle Administrators. The resulting amendment relaxed the rule to permit more than one label, sticker, or decalcomania
to be displayed, and added the requirement that no portion of any label, sticker, decalcomania, or other vision-reducing
matter may extend upward more than 4.5 inches from the bottom of such windshield. While the ICC did not provide an explanation
for the selection of a 4.5 inch dimension, most inspection decals range from 3.5 to 4 inches in size, and the dimension
was apparently chosen to allow for variations in the application of stickers and decalcomania. (The water-activated
adhesives used for decalcomania prior to the availability of self-stick adhesives in the early 1960's tended to make
them somewhat difficult to position.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of &sect;393.60, particularly the 4.5 inch limit specified &sect;393.60(c), are independent
of the physical dimensions of windshields. CMV design has made significant strides since the time the regulation
was promulgated, in part because of research leading to a better understanding of driver anthropometry and ergonomics.
Improved positioning of driving controls, availability of more effective mirrors, enhanced adjustability of seats,
and larger CMV windshields are just a few of the design advances made since the 1950's and 1960's. However, the requirements
of &sect;393.60(c) have not kept pace.

Advantage I&hyph;75 Alpha Test

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To evaluate the performance and usability of the transponders, it was necessary to assess various locations for mounting
the devices during an initial on-the-road ``alpha test.'' Plans called for the transponders to be mounted near the
upper and lower borders of the windshields of CMV cabs. Approximately 200 vehicles, representing six motor carriers'
fleets, were to be equipped with electronic transponders to transmit and receive information from CMV weigh stations
and ports of entry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although placing the transponders in the windshield was considered the best solution from an engineering standpoint,
some of the locations would have conflicted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;393.60(c). The proposed lower-border transponder location would have been just within the border area permitted
under this section. However, the upper-border location would have been in violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 11, 1993, Don C. Kelly, Secretary of Transportation for the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Chairman of the
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Policy Committee, wrote to the FHWA, requesting a waiver of &sect;393.60(c) for the purpose
of conducting the alpha test of these AVI transponders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1993, the FHWA responded that the agency would not apply, or require the States to apply, &sect;393.60(c)
to vehicles, drivers and motor carriers participating in the alpha test from November 15, 1993, to January 21, 1994,
or whenever the test ended, whichever was earlier. (The alpha test was originally scheduled to run during this period.
Because of poor weather and a number of engineering changes to the transponder and the roadside communications devices,
the start of the test was delayed until March 7, 1994, and the agency's enforcement moratorium was extended, first
until August 31, 1994, and eventually to March 31, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In granting temporary relief from the requirements of &sect;393.60(c), the FHWA expressly recognized the need for
good visibility, but acknowledged that the alpha test was a short-duration trial involving a small number of trucks.
The FHWA also noted that participating motor carriers were volunteers that agreed to provide their drivers with thorough
orientation and training on the use of the AVI devices, that the drivers had participated in focus groups in preparation
for these tests, and that they were made particularly aware of the need for objective evaluations of any problems,
including reduced visibility, caused by the placement of the transponders. Because there would have been no way to
conduct a real-world evaluation of AVI technology without operating in conflict with &sect;393.60(c), the FHWA
decided not to require the enforcement of that provision for the brief period needed to gather data in preparation
for the exhaustive beta phase of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition of this temporary relief from enforcement of the provisions of &sect;393.60(c), the FHWA required
that the AVI transponder be mounted outside the area swept by the vehicle's windshield wipers, or outside the driver's
sight lines to the road and highway signs or signals. The following conditions also had to be met: (1) a copy of the letter
granting the temporary relief was to be carried in each motor vehicle used in the AVI alpha test program; and (2) a letter
from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, on official letterhead, clearly identifying any vehicle involved in the AVI alpha
test program, was to be carried in that vehicle. If any of the participating vehicles were stopped for non-compliance
with &sect;393.60(c) during the test period, the driver was to present a copy of both letters to the enforcement official
involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the test was run on an instrumented segment of I&hyph;75 in Kentucky, the FHWA noted that the participating
vehicles would also operate elsewhere. Since the transponders could be damaged by repeatedly removing and re-installing
them, participants in the alpha test were allowed to leave the transponders on the windshields, no matter where the
vehicles traveled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alpha test is anticipated to be completed on October 20, 1994. ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 has informed us that no drivers
reported any difficulties with their vision being obscured as a result of the placement of the transponder.

ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Beta Test and HELP Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and the HELP programs are currently planning to expand the geographic coverage and scope
of their initial activities. The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 beta test is expected to involve up to 5000 CMVs in the I&hyph;75
and Canadian Highway 401 corridor. The purpose of the beta test is to evaluate the actual operation of the transponders
and to assess their potential to be used as a part of everyday motor carrier operations on a nationwide basis. HELP will
deploy an ITS information network for CMVs in the original HELP/CRESCENT States, as well as in several additional
ones. HELP is planning to equip at least 25,000 CMVs in its fee-for-service system by the end of 1995, and at least twice
that many a year later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motor carriers participating in the programs have to meet stringent prequalification criteria set by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP. For ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, these criteria include: (1) A Satisfactory safety rating
from the FHWA Office of Motor Carriers; (2) an acceptable record in all States and/or Canadian Provinces in which the
carrier intends to operate (including registration and taxes, safety performance, and other compliance items consistent
with existing statutes); (3) agreement to abide by the FMCSRs or the Canadian equivalent; (4) agreement to participate
in the project evaluation process; and (5) the carriers' self-certification that their enrolled trucks will meet
an inspection protocol, at least quarterly, equivalent to the requirements of a Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance
Level 1 inspection. The beta test is scheduled to commence in March 1995 and to continue for two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criteria for participation in the HELP program differ slightly. However, all States will require motor carriers
to have a Satisfactory safety rating from the FHWA Office of Motor Carriers and be in compliance with administrative
requirements (such as fuel tax and registration). Inspectors in the HELP States can require that as many as 5 percent
of all electronically cleared CMVs enter inspection stations to verify their safety and administrative status.
The officer at the inspection station can also override any bypass on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA received formal requests for a waiver of the requirements of &sect;393.60(c) from the Commonwealth of Kentucky
on September 19, 1994, and from HELP on August 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA believes that both motor carriers and the travelling public may derive substantial operational and safety
benefits from the use of ITS/CVO technologies. The Congress has made the ITS program the centerpiece of a concerted
effort to apply advanced technology to America's highway transportation system. The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP
programs are the first in a series of field trials of AVI devices for commercial motor vehicles. In the relatively short
term, this technology could improve the productivity of both the trucking industry and State enforcement personnel
by reducing the need for repeated vehicle inspections. It would also reduce fuel consumption and air pollution, and
may improve highway safety by reducing congestion, particularly around inspection stations. It would also enable
POE officials to target their resources to deal with vehicles more likely to be operating in noncompliance with safety
and administrative regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While members of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Policy Committee have informally expressed interest in petitioning the
FHWA to change the requirements of &sect;393.60(c), it is the agency's belief that this section should be subject
to a more detailed review than is possible in the short time remaining before the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 beta test and
the HELP program commence. The FHWA is therefore proposing to provide a waiver from the requirements of &sect;393.60(c)
to the vehicles participating in the beta phase of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 project. Because the HELP program proposes
to use the same transponders as ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, the FHWA also proposes to provide a waiver to those participating
vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA notes that no safety concerns or complaints have been reported by alpha test participants, nor by any other
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition for a waiver is being considered under section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C.
31136(e), formerly 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(f)) which authorizes waivers of any regulation issued under the authority
of that Act upon a determination that the waiver is consistent with the public interest and the safe operation of commercial
motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditions of the Waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Location of the Transponder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a condition of the waiver, the FHWA proposes that the transponder be mounted at or near the top center of the windshield,
outside the area swept by the CMV's windshield wipers, or, at a minimum, outside the driver's sight lines to the road
and highway signs or signals. The FHWA believes that this location would have no discernable effect on a driver's ability
to operate the vehicle safely. The AVI device would be placed in a position that would be within the portion of the windshield
covered by a sunvisor. It is also in approximately the same relative position in the windshield of a CMV as that of a rear-view
mirror in a passenger car. There is no evidence that sunvisors or rear-view mirrors pose a threat to safety by obstructing
a driver's vision, and thus, we have no reason to believe that a transponder of the type and dimensions to be used in the
test would have a negative effect on safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Compliance With Wiring Requirements of the FMCSRs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The installation of the transponder would be required to comply with &sect;393.27, Wiring specifications, and &sect;393.33,
Wiring [and] installation.

III. Duration of Waiver; Accident and Incident Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the requests indicated a 2-year period for the beta test, the FHWA notes that the alpha test was delayed several
times to resolve technical matters. Since all research in a field environment is likely to experience some start-up
delays, the FHWA proposes to make the term of the waiver 3 years for HELP and 3 years for ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, or until
the beta test is completed, whichever occurs first. This would allow for a continuous period of data collection once
the programs were fully underway. If the waiver is granted, this period would begin when the FHWA publishes the final
conditions of the waiver in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Motor carriers participating in ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP would be required to provide the FHWA's Office of Motor
Carrier Standards with information on accidents (as defined in &sect;390.5 of the FMCSRs) involving the vehicles
equipped with the transponders. Accident reports would be required to be submitted every 6 months, and would be required
to contain the information listed below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A copy of all accident reports prepared and required by State or other governmental entities or insurers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Interview information with the driver and occupants of the CMV involved. The information would be required to include
specifically whether the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle believed that the presence of the transponder
was a factor in the accident. The interview would be required to be conducted by a motor carrier employee responsible
for supervising the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. State and Local Laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA strongly encourages State and local authorities with safety regulations that would prohibit the use of the
proposed transponders to accept the terms of the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Number of Vehicles To Be Equipped With Transponders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of straight trucks, tractors, and motorcoaches that may be equipped with the transponders would be limited
to no more than 5000 for ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and 25,000 for HELP. The names and USDOT numbers of the motor carriers participating
in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP programs, as well as the number of transponder-equipped CMVs operated by each
carrier, would be required to be provided to the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Termination of Waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transponders would be required to be removed from the CMVs participating in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP projects
(1) upon completion of the 3-year period, or (2) upon completion of the project, or (3) when required by the FHWA either
at the completion of a semi-annual review or at any time it is determined by the FHWA that the continued use of the devices
decreases the safe operation of the vehicles on which they are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP would be required to provide separate reports at the conclusion of the program describing
the transponder's installation and use. The reports would be required to include information obtained from the drivers
on the device's effect on visibility through the windshield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Request for Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA requests public comment on the proposed waiver and on the attendant conditions. Comments are also sought
from State and local enforcement officials relating to their experiences with windshield-mounted electronic devices,
such as those used in electronic toll-collection systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is also interested in comments on the projected impacts on safety if windshield-mounted transponders were
to be allowed under &sect;393.60(c) of the FMCSRs, without the conditions that would be imposed under the waiver.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is proposing revisions to its standard licensing application form (Form OP&hyph;1), amendments
to the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1002 and 1160, and elimination of the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1161, 1162, and 1163.
The proposed revisions implement the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act (TIRRA), Title II of the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act Amendments of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;311 (August 26, 1994), which significantly amended
licensing standards for non-household goods motor property carriers, effective January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To accommodate the changes mandated by TIRRA, the Commission also is proposing further modifications to the application
procedures and regulations involved in the ongoing Application Forms proceeding. The Commission's decision and
final rules adopted in this proceeding will embrace and dispose of issues pending in the Application Forms proceeding.

notice of proposed rulemaking, the Commission proposed to replace the Form OP&hyph;1 with a series of six transportation
mode-specific forms and to adopt corresponding revisions to the agency's licensing regulations. In particular,
the proposed motor carrier application forms included expanded safety fitness certification requirements for
applicants that were exempt from, or as-yet-unrated under, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) safety regulations.

as proposed, including the expanded safety fitness certifications. At that time, the Commission invited public
comment on further revisions to the proposed motor property carrier form to recognize revisions to DOT's hazardous
materials commodity classifications and corresponding liability insurance coverage for transporters of those
commodities.

proceeding, Congress enacted TIRRA, changing the licensing standards and procedures for motor property carriers
of commodities other than household goods. Specifically, TIRRA's Sections 207 [adding a new 49 U.S.C. 10922(b)]
and 208 [adding a new 49 U.S.C. 10923(b)] respectively eliminate the public need/public interest licensing standards
for non-household goods motor property common and contract carriers and substitute fitness-based standards. Effective
January 1, 1995, the Commission is directed to issue authorities upon a finding that the applicant is in compliance
with:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Expedited Licensing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under TIRRA the application process can be shortened and dramatically simplified. The revised licensing procedures
proposed here envision processing only those applications filed by entities with acceptable DOT safety fitness
ratings or, in the case of unrated or exempt applicants, those certifying their safety compliance. In a break with
past practice, we will require each applicant to obtain the insurance certificate from the insurance company and
file it along with the application form. While we believe this approach is beneficial, we will give individuals the
opportunity to comment on whether it is feasible and whether it maintains the integrity of the insurance compliance
system. Also, at the time of filing, all applications must be accompanied by process agent filings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Up front filing of insurance information and a list of process agents will allow the Commission to compress the time
required to handle applications and confine the process to qualified applicants who are prepared to enter the trucking
industry. Safety compliance can be verified easily by Commission staff before applications are processed. As an
extra safeguard that applicants are making bona fide insurance filings, we will include the name of the insurance
carrier in the ICC Register notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the basic licensing standards confirmed prior to processing and publication of an application, the remainder
of the licensing process can be sharply reduced. By law, protests are limited to evidence that an applicant fails or
will fail to meet the fitness entry standards. The proposed revised application form and regulations, therefore,
also eliminate those features of the licensing process_such as extended protest periods and pre-licensing review
of carrier control relationships_that would unreasonably prolong or not contribute to basic fitness assessments.
The brief protest period will allow us to hear from insurance companies that question applicants' filings or others
who may have information to supplement DOT's safety information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost 15 years of eased entry requirements under the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 have produced a licensing docket where
each year less than a dozen of the approximately 17,000 applications filed are opposed. A brief protest period should
suffice to identify the limited number of applications that deserve strict screening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, common control information is not necessary in applying the TIRRA licensing standards. Commonly controlled
carriers with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness ratings are prioritized by DOT for continuing safety fitness oversight,
and those transporting hazardous materials or passengers, in particular, either must achieve an improved safety
fitness rating in a limited time period or be placed out of service by DOT. Those with insurance problems will be identified
through our existing insurance monitoring program. Nevertheless, we are including an ``Affiliations'' question
to be sure that carriers with poor safety compliance records do not attempt to reenter under a different name.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, under TIRRA, non-household goods property carriers no longer need to file tariffs for individually- determined
rates. Tariff filing is required only for collectively-determined rates. Therefore, we are eliminating the requirement
for newly-authorized common carriers to file tariffs prior to commencing operations under their certificates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the expedited application procedures in the revised rules set forth below and the proposed simplified
Form OP&hyph;1 set forth in the Appendix incorporate TIRRA reforms and otherwise will preserve the integrity of the
licensing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For applications with more extensive pre-licensing information (household goods property carriers, certain categories
of passenger carriers, brokers, freight forwarders of household goods, and water carriers), we will use mode-specific
schedules that applicants must append to their basic Form OP&hyph;1 filings. We believe that this approach will preserve
the advantages of the mode-specific format endorsed by the public in our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application Forms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
proceeding without complicating the licensing process mandated under TIRRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new procedures shift compliance screening from the end of the process to the beginning by requiring applicants
to establish their safety fitness, submit proof of insurance, and designate process agents at the time they file their
applications. Consistent with this change, we have revised the Applicant's Oath in the proposed Form OP&hyph;1 to
clarify that it embraces all supplemental filings and documentation. We also have included in the oath the applicant's
certification that it is not domiciled in Mexico nor is it owned or controlled by persons of Mexico.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
Practical Reforms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The reforms proposed here will be coupled with several practical adjustments to the agency's automated data and recordkeeping
systems. First, the Commission will simultaneously enter application information and insurance records in its
automated data system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, we will merge DOT's safety fitness data into our automated data system more frequently to confirm motor carrier
applicants' DOT safety fitness ratings. This information will continue to be checked upon initial receipt of each
application. Filings by applicants with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness ratings will be rejected summarily.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in view of the substantially reduced protest period (from 45 to 5 days), we will permit protestants to FAX their
initial submissions, followed by a signed original and one copy for Commission records. Reply and rebuttal evidence,
where permitted, likewise may be FAXed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with TIRRA's elimination of public need/public interest standards, we will no longer publish specific
caption summaries or issue authorities with specific service descriptions to the vast majority of applicants. Applicants
will be issued certificates or permits to operate as interstate common or contract carriers. All non-household goods
motor property applicants that conform with fitness requirements will be authorized to transport general commodities
between points in the United States. The extent of each applicant's hazardous materials authority will correspond
to the level of bodily injury and property damage insurance coverage reflected in the Form BMC&hyph;91 or 91X filed
with the application, as indicated in the ICC Register licensing request notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service descriptions for licensing categories not affected by TIRRA_for example, passenger carrier special and
charter service, general commodities and household goods property brokerage, and household goods freight forwarding_also
will be standardized. This change should further simplify the pre-licensing review process and streamline application
notices and authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
Temporary Operating Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Simplifying licensing procedures, deleting the public need/public interest standards, and expediting time frames
for issuing operating authority as proposed here largely eliminate the need for the Commission's existing temporary
and emergency temporary authority procedures. Temporary authority (TA) and emergency temporary authority (ETA)
are sought and granted routinely because of the amount of time it takes to obtain permanent authority. With the enactment
of TIRRA we will use our discretion under 49 U.S.C. 10928 to confine TAs to their original limited, intended purpose.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accordingly, we also propose to eliminate the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1162 and 1163 governing TA and ETA applications.
However, we will continue to entertain TA requests for motor and water carrier authority in those rare instances (i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 natural disasters or national emergencies) where an applicant can document an immediate need for its service that
cannot be met by an existing carrier and for which service must be available in less than the 30 days we anticipate will
be required to process fully a permanent authority application under the procedures proposed here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Essentially, the greatly curtailed TA process noted in the proposed regulations at 49 CFR 1160.4(g) would displace
what has been known as ETA. We expect that any such filings can be acted upon by the Commission's regional offices (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 49 CFR 1011.6(f)(1)) within 5 business days of their receipt, the time frame generally allotted for ETAs under current
practices.

should ensure that the Commission has sufficient time to review the comments and devise final application forms and
procedures prior to the January 1, 1995 effective date of TIRRA's revised licensing standards. The final decision
and rules issued in this proceeding will include matters addressed in the pending

Environmental and Energy Analysis

We preliminarily conclude that the proposed action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human
environment or the conservation of energy resources. Nevertheless, we specifically invite parties to comment on
these issues.

[RFA], the Commission is required to examine specifically the impact of a proposed action on small businesses and
small organizations. We expect that the proposed revised application form and corresponding regulations will result
in significant cost savings to both applicants and the Commission over the long term and will present immediate benefits
in terms of simplified administrative processes and expedited licensing procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the clear prospects for cost savings and enhanced administrative efficiencies, we do not anticipate that
the proposal will have a significant economic impact as contemplated by RFA standards. The projected impact on individual
small entities, albeit positive, will be incremental and clearly not substantial within the meaning of RFA.

Paperwork Reduction Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under
Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We estimate that an average of 2.5 burden hours will be required to complete the proposed Form OP&hyph;1 and provide
pertinent supplemental evidence, as compared with 4 burden hours for the application form currently used. This expected
reduction in response time is attributable not only to elimination of the public need/public interest evidence requirements
for non-household goods motor property applicants, as mandated by TIRRA, but also to the simplified response format
and the self-contained application, supplements, and instructions. Accordingly, we anticipate that the reduced
completion burden will be realized by applicants in all motor carrier industry segments, not merely those directly
affected by TIRRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual reporting burden ascribed to the Form OP&hyph;1 in the current OMB inventory is 64,000 hours, based on an
estimate of 4 burden hours per filing and 16,000 Form OP&hyph;1 filings per year at the time the estimate was submitted.
We anticipate that this annual reporting burden will be reduced to approximately 42,500 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This estimate is based on our expectation that licensing application filings will rise slightly over those recorded
in fiscal year 1993 (to approximately 18,000). This projection reflects at least a short-term increased interest
in obtaining motor common carrier authority due to TIRRA's elimination of individual tariff filing requirements
for non-household goods motor property carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated burden hours include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The reduced reporting
burden estimated here does not reflect further reductions in the Commission's overall reporting burden occasioned
by the elimination of ETA filings and the significant projected reduction in TA filings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in this proposal will be submitted to OMB for review under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and 5 CFR Part 1320. Comments concerning the paperwork burden and burden-hour estimates
in this proposal may be directed to OMB and the Commission, respectively, at: Office of Management and Budget, Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attn: Ed Clark, Desk Officer, (Forms-3120&hyph;0047), Washington, DC 20503

statutory and regulatory provisions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transportation to be provided will be consistent with the public interest and the national transportation
policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101.

 NMFS issues this proposed rule to clarify that the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) that make
it unlawful for any person or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, intentionally to set a purse
seine net on or to encircle any marine mammal during any tuna fishing operation, apply to all U.S. citizens regardless
of the flag of the vessel. This rule also clarifies the geographic scope of the prohibition. This action is intended
to clarify statutory language to further the goals and objectives of the MMPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1992, the International Dolphin Conservation Act (IDCA) amended the MMPA in several respects, including making
it unlawful, after February 28, 1994, for any person or vessel that is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,
intentionally to set a purse seine net on or to encircle any marine mammal during any tuna fishing operation. The IDCA
provides two relevant exceptions to these prohibitions: (1) As necessary for scientific research; and (2) as authorized
by the general permit that was issued to the American Tunaboat Association on December 1, 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The taking of marine mammals by U.S. purse seine vessels fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific
Ocean (ETP) is regulated by NMFS, pursuant to the MMPA, because purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the ETP has
frequently involved the setting on, encircling, and capturing of dolphins as part of the fishing operation. Earlier
this year, NMFS determined that the dolphin mortality quota prescribed under the MMPA for vessels under the American
Tunaboat Association general permit (which covers only U.S.-flag vessels) had been reached and, on February 8, 1994,
closed the tuna fishery in the ETP involving the intentional setting on or encirclement of marine mammals to U.S.-flag
vessels (59 FR 8417, February 27, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of a written inquiry and a subsequent lawsuit by U.S. citizens working aboard foreign-flag purse seine
vessels, NMFS learned earlier this year that U.S. citizens are involved in the ETP purse seine yellowfin tuna fishery
involving the intentional setting on and encirclement of marine mammals as captains and crew members on foreign-flag
vessels. For the purposes of the prohibitions that were added to the MMPA by the IDCA, NMFS considers ``any person subject
to the jurisdiction of the United States'' to include any U.S. citizen aboard a fishing vessel, regardless of the flag
of the vessel, located within the territorial sea of the United States, the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ), on
the high seas, or seaward of the territorial seas of foreign nations. Therefore, U.S. citizens in other nations' EEZs,
but seaward of the territorial seas of any nation, are subject to the prohibitions of the MMPA. The highest priority
in enforcing these prohibitions will be against those U.S. citizens, such as captains or fish captains, who are in
charge of or actually control fishing operations involving the setting on and encirclement of marine mammals. A lower
priority in enforcing these prohibitions will be against crew members who are not in a position of authority involving
the conduct of fishing operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS will continue to enforce all other prohibitions governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to tuna purse
seine fishing operations, as well as all other prohibitions under the MMPA, within waters subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States, on the high seas, and seaward of the territorial seas of foreign nations. This area includes all
of the ETP seaward of foreign nations' territorial seas. The MMPA and NMFS regulations define ``taking'' to include
the harassment, hunting, capturing, or killing of any marine mammal, or the attempt to do so. Violators of the MMPA
and the implementing regulations are subject to criminal and civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to amend 50 CFR 216.24(a) to make clear that the MMPA prohibitions on intentionally setting on and
encircling marine mammals during tuna purse seine vessel fishing operations apply to all U.S. citizens regardless
of the flag of the vessel. In addition, the notice proposes to revise the language describing ``prohibited taking''
found at &sect;216.11 to make clear that the prohibition does not apply to the territorial seas of foreign nations,
but applies seaward of them.

This rule proposes to revise MMPA regulations to conform to an existing statutory prohibition that became effective
pursuant to the IDCA on March 1, 1994. The proposed rule would not establish any new prohibitions or requirements.
The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that the proposed modifications to the regulations, if
adopted, would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

 EPA is responding to several citizens' petitions requesting the Agency to revise the list of ``extremely hazardous
substances'' published under section 302 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA).
EPA is proposing a rule to delete from the extremely hazardous substance list phosphorous pentoxide, dithlycarbamazine
citrate, fenitrothion and tellurium, and to revise the threshold planning quantity for isophorone diisocyanate
from 100 to 1,000 pounds. EPA is denying petitions requesting deletion from the EHS list of paraquat and isophorone
diisocyanate. The Agency is also denying a petition that requests revision of the threshold planning quantities
for azinphos-methyl and fenamiphos.

A. Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is issued under sections 302 and 328 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
of 1986 (EPCRA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 17, 1986, the President signed into law the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA'').
Pub. L. 99&hyph;499 (1986). Title III of SARA established a program designed to require state and local planning and
preparedness for spills or releases of hazardous substances and to provide the public and local governments with
information concerning potential chemical hazards in their communities. This program is codified as the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11001&hyph;11050. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle A of EPCRA establishes the framework for local emergency planning. The Statute required that EPA publish
the Agency's list of ``extremely hazardous substances'' (``EHSs''). This had previously been published in November,
1985, by the EPA Administrator in Appendix A of the ``Chemical Emergency Preparedness Program Interim Guidance''
(CEPP Guidance), as the list of acutely toxic chemicals. The Agency was also directed to establish ``threshold planning
quantities'' (``TPQs'') for each extremely hazardous substance. Under section 302, a facility which has present
an EHS in excess of its threshold planning quantity must notify the State emergency response commission and local
emergency planning committee as well as participate in local emergency planning activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the extremely hazardous substance list is to focus initial efforts in the development of State and local
contingency plans. It is not intended to be a complete list of all chemicals that could potentially be hazardous to
a community. The identification of a chemical that meets the EHS criteria does not in itself indicate the potential
for serious effects in any release, accidental or routine. Thus, inclusion on the EHS list is not meant as a signal to
state or local communities to ban or otherwise restrict use of a listed chemical. Rather, such identification indicates
a need for the community to undertake a program to investigate and evaluate the potential for accidental exposure
associated with the production, storage or handling of the chemical at a particular site. EPA also encourages communities
to go beyond the EHS list when evaluating the hazards of facilities in their community, in that facilities handling
chemicals not on the EHS list could be as hazardous as those handling EHSs.

1. Regulatory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The list of extremely hazardous substances and their threshold planning quantities is codified in EPA regulations
at volume 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 355, appendices A and B (40 CFR, Part 355, Apps. A &amp; B). EPA's
explanation for the methodologies used to determine whether to list a substance as an extremely hazardous substance
and for deriving the threshold planning quantities is found in preambles to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices which promulgated these rules. The relevant notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 17, 1986 (51 FR 41570&hyph;41592), and April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13378&hyph;13410). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the November 17, 1986 notice EPA, as required by EPCRA section 302, promulgated an interim final rule which, among
other things, included a list of extremely hazardous substances and established their threshold planning quantities.
While the interim final rule established enforceable requirements, the Agency simultaneously solicited public
comments, as explained in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice issued on the same day (51 FR 41953&hyph;54). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received public comment on the interim final rule and issued a final rule on April 22, 1987, which responded in its
preamble to the public comments. The April 1987 final rule made a number of revisions to the interim final rule. Among
other things, the April 1987 rule republished the extremely hazardous substance list, with the addition of four new
chemicals, and revised the methodology for determining some threshold planning quantities (52 FR 13381). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Details of the methodology used to determine whether to list a substance as an extremely hazardous substance and for
deriving the threshold planning quantities are found in the November 1986 notice at 51 FR 41573&hyph;41579 and 41580
(Attachment 1), in the April 1987 notice at 52 FR 13387&hyph;13392, and in technical support documents in the rulemaking
records.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's notice proposes a rule to amend 40 CFR, part 355 (Appendices A and B), to delist phosphorus pentoxide, diethylcarbamazine
citrate, fenitrothion and tellurium from the list of extremely hazardous substances and to revise the threshold
planning quantity for isophorone diisocyanate from 100 pounds to 1,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is denying the requests to delist paraquat and isophorone diisocyanate and the request to change the threshold
planning quantities for azinphos-methyl and fenamiphos. These decisions constitute final agency action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to remove the four chemicals noted above from the extremely hazardous substance list because review
of the available toxicity data shows they do not meet the listing criteria. EPA believes these four chemicals were
incorrectly listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to revise the threshold planning quantity for isophorone diisocyanate from 100 to 1,000 pounds,
based upon the Agency's own review of the physical and chemical properties of the chemical, even though revision of
the threshold planning quantity was not requested in the petition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the Agency listed phosphorus pentoxide based upon an abstract (Ballantyne (1981)). The Agency now
believes that this abstract should not be used as the basis for listing. The title of the abstract reported the toxicity
of phosphorus pentoxide smoke. However, the study was actually performed using the smoke generated by burning red
phosphorus. In burning red phosphorus, two studies (Tarnov (1980) and Burton et. al (1982)) have shown that the major
product is phosphorus pentoxide. However, the Ballantyne abstract does not establish that the toxicity found was
attributable to the phosphorous pentoxide in the smoke, or other chemicals in lower concentrations. Since there
is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the animals in Ballantyne's study were primarily exposed to phosphorus
pentoxide, the available data from Ballantyne's findings are insufficient to prove or disprove that the LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 values in guinea pigs and mice satisfy the criteria for listing phosphorous pentoxide on the EHS list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information submitted by the Elemental Phosphorus Ad Hoc Solid Waste Group showed that the direct tests on phosphorous
pentoxide show an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value higher than the criteria for listing. In an unpublished Monsanto report (1987), rats were exposed to aerosolized
phosphorous pentoxide for 4 hours, at levels up to 0.99 mg/liter. (It should be noted that although the analytical
standards used in the analysis conducted for this study were phosphorous pentoxide, no information was obtained
regarding the actual chemical species present in the chamber atmosphere.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the only available study in the literature that provides direct evidence of the toxic potential of phosphorous
pentoxide. The LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for phosphorous pentoxide was found to be greater than 0.99 mg/liter, which does not meet the criteria for listing
for listing substances as an extremely hazardous substance. Since the Agency now believes that the abstract used
as the basis for listing is invalid (the Agency was unable to obtain the actual report) and the only direct studies available
to the Agency show that phosphorus pentoxide does not meet the listing criteria, the Agency is proposing to remove
the chemical from the EHS list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diethylcarbamazine citrate was listed on the basis of a report in a Russian data compilation showing an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inhalation value of 0.309 mg/liter/4 hours in rats. The citation number listed in the United Nations sponsored translation
is incorrect, and additional details about the original study are unavailable. Methods used for this inhalation
toxicity study could not be found to determine if they meet international standards, therefore, the toxicity values
could not be verified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An inhalation study sponsored by SmithKline Beecham indicated that a 1-hour exposure of rats to Diethylcarbamazine
citrate at concentration of 1.63 mg per liter or 2.38 mg per liter produced no fatalities. Since the only studies available
to EPA show that this chemical does not meet the listing criteria for inhalation (LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 less than 0.5 mg per liter), the Agency is proposing to remove it from the EHS list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fenitrothion was initially listed because it appeared to meet the extremely hazardous substance criteria, based
upon a study showing an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.378 mg/liter/4 hours (NIOSH/RTECS 1985). The delisting petition charged that this study was deficient in that
the material tested contained a toxic impurity of unknown potency, and that the study overestimated the toxicity
of fenitrothion itself, because the test material contained surfactants that would have made the test animal's skin
and cell membranes more permeable to the test substance. Examination of a study submitted by the petitioner (Kohda
et. al (1986)) reports an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of above 2.210 mg/liter. In studying the report provided by the petitioner, the Agency agrees that the data by which
the listing is based may have been in error for the reasons stated by the petitioner. Since the only other study available
to the Agency shows that fenitrothion does not meet the listing criteria, EPA is proposing to remove this substance
from the EHS list.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of less than or equal to 25 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight. The petitioner brought to the Agency's attention that
the study was actually on sodium tellurate (CAS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(Prinsen (1991)) which showed an LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for tellurium metal in excess of 5000 mg/kg. Based upon this information, the Agency is proposing to remove tellurium
from the EHS listing while maintaining the listing for sodium tellurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comments on whether it should proceed to delist these four chemicals based upon this information
or any additional information submitted by commenters relating to whether these chemicals meet the section 302 listing
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HULs America, Inc. submitted a petition to delist isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). EPA is denying the petition to
delist because IPDI meets the criteria for listing, as discussed in the next Unit on Petition Denials. However, in
considering this petition, EPA noted that the threshold planning quantity had been determined based on IPDI's being
a reactive solid at standard temperatures, when in fact it is a liquid and not highly reactive. Accordingly, EPA is
proposing to change the threshold planning quantity for IPDI based on the methodology for determining threshold
planning quantities for liquids instead of the methodology for reactive solids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's methodology for establishing threshold planning quantities for liquids, once it is determined that the substance
meets the listing criteria, consists of initially determining the maximum short term exposure concentration in
air that would not lead to serious irreversible health effects in the general population when exposed to the substance
for relatively short duration. This is the so-called ``level of concern.'' (See the Threshold Planning Quantities
Technical Support Document, April 7, 1987.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two ways to determine a ``level of concern.'' If it is available for a chemical, EPA may use the Immediately
Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH). This is the maximum concentration of a substance in air to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes
and escape without suffering irreversible health effects or impairing symptoms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the IDLH value is not available, as is the case for most of the EHSs, the EPA uses an IDLH equivalent value using available
toxicity data with an adjustment factor to estimate the IDLH value. For the initial TPQ for IPDI the LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.12 mg/l over a 4 hour exposure period was multiplied by 0.1 to estimate the IDLH value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of concern is then divided by a factor ``V'' which represents the extent to which the material can volatilize
and become airborne and dispersed. This is explained in the November 17, 1986 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice at 51 FR 41577. For liquids this involves knowing the molecular weight and vapor pressure. The derivation of
the factor ``V'' for liquids is explained in Appendix 1 of the November 17, 1986 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for the interim final rule (51 FR 41580). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final threshold planning quantity is then determined from a set of index values. The index values and their corresponding
threshold planning quantities are found in the threshold planning quantity technical support document. Applying
this methodology to IPDI gives it a threshold planning quantity of 1000 pounds. The calculations for this determination
are found in the administrative record for this petition. EPA is, thus, proposing to raise the threshold planning
quantity for IPDI from 100 to 1000 pounds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is denying the petition of ICI Americas with respect to paraquat. The petitioner requests the Agency to remove
paraquat from the extremely hazardous substance list or, in the alternative, to revise the threshold planning quantity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner notes that the ``paraquat'' on the EHS list is actually paraquat dichloride since, strictly speaking,
paraquat is a divalent cation which can form many different salts, and paraquat dichloride is the only commercially
available paraquat salt in the United States. Further, the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number identified on
the EHS list is the number for paraquat dichloride. Petitioner bases its request to delist paraquat (dichloride)
on the fact that the only studies that show LD

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests below the Agency criteria for listing are tests on either the pure solid form of the chemical or the highly concentrated
form of the solution. Petitioner claims that the toxicity for any commercially available form is much lower than the
EHS listing criteria and that tests showing high toxicity are of no practical importance.

EPA agrees with petitioner that paraquat dichloride is the appropriate listed chemical. To clear any confusion that
may result from the conflict between the paraquat listing and the CAS number, EPA is making a technical amendment to
the EHS listing in 40 CFR Part 355 by substituting the term paraquat dichloride for paraquat (published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All indications from the petition are that the public has been complying with the regulations under the assumption
that ``paraquat'' refers to the paraquat dichloride product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with petitioner that paraquat dichloride should be removed from the EHS list because only highly concentrated
forms show high toxicity. Paraquat dichloride qualifies as an EHS because some form of it shows high toxicity that
exceeds the Agency's criteria. This is the case for many animal tests used to determine toxicity for regulatory purposes.
Animals may be dosed in concentrated forms or at very high levels to determine toxicity. The dose in the studies may
be much higher than any found in actual practice. In the case of LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests, half the animals die. If these tests show 50 percent mortality at a relatively low dose, they at least raise concerns
that qualify for listing. Smaller numbers of subjects may be affected at much lower doses, but that does not eliminate
any concern for the tested chemical. Paraquat dichloride is listed because it is grouped with those chemicals that
exceed Agency criteria in some form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for listing paraquat was a study (Murray and Gibson, 1972) which showed a formulation containing paraquat
dichloride as having an oral (guinea pig) LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of 22 mg/kg. Although the toxicity of the paraquat dichloride formulation is caused solely by the paraquat ion,
based on the LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 22mg/kg for paraquat ion, ICI estimated an oral LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of 30.4 mg/kg for paraquat dichloride which does not meet the EHS criteria. ICI sponsored two acute inhalation
studies in rats (ICI, 1989). The studies resulted in an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of .001 mg/liter for the paraquat ion, which can be estimated for paraquat dichloride to be an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of .00138 mg/liter. This value would meet the EHS criteria for listing of 0.5 mg/liter as noted above. EPA is changing
the basis for listing value from oral LD

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.00138 mg/liter for paraquat dichloride. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner, alternatively, requests that the threshold planning quantity for paraquat dichloride should be higher
than the current amount of 10 pounds. The threshold planning quantity for paraquat is 10 pounds for the chemical in
finely powdered form (particle size under 100 microns), in molten form, or in solution. For paraquat in solid form
with particle size greater than 100 microns the threshold planning quantity is 10,000 pounds. EPA's reasoning for
determining these levels is found in the November 17, 1986 interim final rule notice at 51 FR 41575&hyph;76 and 41577,
as amended by the April 22, 1987 final rule notice at 52 FR 13390. A summary of that reasoning follows.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The paraquat listed, essentially the dichloride salt, is a solid in solution. There is available for paraquat an IDLH
level of 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). This converts to an Index Value of .0015, which results in a threshold
planning quantity of 10 pounds. While the November, 1986 notice for the interim final EHS listing rule applied this
calculation to all solids, the April 22, 1987, notice (52 FR 13390&hyph;91) modified this by applying this calculation
to solids only if they have a particle size less than 100 microns, if they are handled in solution or molten form, or if
they have a high rating for reactivity. For particle sizes over 100 microns, the threshold planning quantity is 10,000
pounds. Paraquat dichloride, therefore, has two threshold planning quantities depending on its particle size and
whether it is used in solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner requests that the Agency base the level of concern for paraquat dichloride on the LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or LC

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests rather than the IDLH. EPA disagrees. The IDLH, while it has flaws, is the best available measure for determining
a level of concern because it is based on actual human data. When an IDLH is available, EPA declines to use conversion
factors, as it does for those substances for which IDLH values are not available (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 51 FR 41576), because these factors are even rougher measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH lists the two chemicals (paraquat and paraquat dichloride) as synonyms (NIOSH/RTECS 1983 Synonyms, Volume
1, p. 719); therefore, the Agency considers the ionic form of paraquat as the dichloride salt in a solution. Since the
IDLH value applies to both the salt and the solution, EPA has decided not to remove the chemical from the EHS list or modify
the TPQ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The paraquat ion is reportable as a solution (or mixture) of paraquat dichloride and a carrier (for example, water).
For threshold purposes, the facility only needs to consider the weight percent of paraquat dichloride that was placed
in the solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Miles, Inc., has submitted a petition requesting that the 10,000-pound TPQ apply to azinphos-methyl and fenamiphos
in the Miles products Guthion 2L and Nemacur 3. Both of these chemicals have TPQs of 10 pounds that apply when the chemicals
are in finely powdered form, in molten form, or in solution, as calculated using the same methodology applied to paraquat
dichloride. The 10,000-pound TPQ applies to the solid form with particle size greater than 100 microns. The petitioner
submits that both of these compounds are ``waxy, amorphous solids with low melting points and their technical grade
materials used for production are generally liquid at summer temperatures.'' The petitioner stated that the TPQ
for the chemicals should be based upon their being liquids using the methodology described for IPDI, above, in unit
II. This would raise the TPQ to 10,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. The Farm Chemicals Handbook (1984 p. C161) lists fenamiphos as a brown, waxy solid. The Hawley handbook
(1981) lists azinphos-methyl as a brown waxy solid as well. Since these references, used as background to the listing,
show these chemicals as solids, the EPA considers the chemicals as solids as well. They would be near the melting point
but never quite reach it. Molten solids are not treated as liquids under the TPQ methodology, because the solids have
to be raised above standard temperature in order to become molten. Since EPA has no way of knowing at what temperatures
facilities have the molten solids (to determine volatilization), EPA chose to consider solids different from chemicals
that are liquid at standard temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, EPA accounts for solids that become liquids (molten form) with the two tiered threshold. When handled in
molten form, the TPQ for these chemicals would be 10 pounds because of the possibility of volatilization. However,
even in molten form, significant amounts of vapor are not likely to be generated. The Agency examined the fraction
of volatilization expected for the solids on the list and found that it ranges from 0.3 to 0.008 pounds/minute per pound
spilled (see Threshold Planning Quantities, Technical Support Document, April 7, 1987, page 27). Since data were
not available for all solids and to be conservative, the Agency chose to incorporate the 0.3 fraction into the reporting
requirements. If a facility is handling the solid in molten form, the amount molten should be multiplied by 0.3 to obtain
the actual amount to be compared to the threshold planning quantity for reporting (see 40 CFR 355.30(e)(iv)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HULs America Inc. submitted a petition to delist isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). IPDI had been listed because it
met the criteria for extremely hazardous substance listing, on the basis of two aerosol inhalation-toxicity studies
in rats. The 4 hour LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is .26 mg per liter, which is less than the LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.5 mg/liter which qualifies it as an extremely hazardous substance under Agency criteria (51 FR 41574). The delisting
petition made the following points. This material is manufactured in a closed system that does not use high pressure,
and contends that unusual measures are required to generate test atmospheres containing IPDI for toxicity testing.
If the substance is aerosolized, particles would be expected to precipitate out of the air. The material is not volatile
under normal conditions. It does not react rapidly with water to generate heat that might cause volatilization. The
low vapor pressure led the Department of Transportation to remove IPDI from its list of materials that are toxic by
inhalation, according to the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. Petitioner's argument is essentially that the test used to determine acute toxicity subjects the
animals to extreme conditions not likely to be found in reality. This, however, is the case for many animal tests used
to determine toxicity for regulatory purposes. In fact, a similar case can be made for most LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests, since the levels at which animals are dosed are far higher than would be delivered in actual conditions. The
fact is that IPDI is toxic at low levels, based on an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, compared to other chemicals regardless of the conditions of the chemical during the test. This qualifies the chemical
for listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extrapolations from the extreme conditions of testing may then be used to determine regulatory levels. For example,
to determine a level of concern for chemicals on the EHS list in calculating threshold planning quantities, as noted
above, EPA applies a conversion factor to the acute toxicity tests. Conversion factors may range from one-tenth to
one-hundredth of the levels found in the acute toxicity tests. This is explained in the November 17, 1986 Interim Final
Rule preamble at 51 FR 41576. For listing purposes, however, conditions of testing are not generally relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, however, as noted above, has taken into account physical/chemical properties of IPDI in proposing to revise
the TPQ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the data used to list paraquat, azinphos-methyl, fenamiphos and isophorone diisocyanate is sound
and that the denial of these petitions is consistent with the listing criteria and TPQ methodology. At this time, the
Agency is not planning to modify the listing criteria nor the TPQ methodology. The Agency however, will accept any
comments on additional criteria which can be used to increase the usefulness of the EHS list and the TPQ methodology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the consideration of these petitions, HULs America brought to the Agency's attention that there may be at least
three competing products with toxicity and physical/chemical properties very similar to IPDI and, therefore should
be treated the same. Huls maintains none of the chemicals should be listed. EPA is requesting information on other
chemicals, currently not listed, for which toxicity meets the criteria, and which therefore warrant listing. At
this time, EPA is not proposing to increase the number of chemicals on the EHS list; however, in the future it will propose
to list chemicals with toxicity information showing that they warrant listing.

IV. Regulatory Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or lean programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., whenever an agency is required to publish a notice
of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility
analysis that describes the effect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and
small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however, if the agency's administrator certifies
that the rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has examined the rule's potential effects on small entities as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It
has determined this rule will have no adverse effect on small entities because it reduces the number of chemicals which
would potentially make businesses subject to the reporting requirements. Therefore, I certify that today's proposed
rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule relieves facilities from having to report the presence of these four chemicals to the State Emergency Response
Commissions and Local Emergency Planning Committees. If these facilities have no other Extremely Hazardous Substances,
they will no longer be required to participate in the emergency planning process required by the statute. Therefore,
there are no information collection requirements for OMB to review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with Title 13, United States Code, Sections 182, 224, and 225, I have determined the Census Bureau needs
to collect data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covering year-end inventories, annual sales, and purchases to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound statistical basis for the formation of policy by various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental agencies. These data also apply to a variety of public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business needs. This annual survey is a continuation of similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale trade surveys conducted each year since 1978. It provides on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a comparable classification basis annual sales and purchases for 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and inventories for 1993 and 1994. These data are not available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publicly on a timely basis from nongovernmental or other governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Census Bureau is authorized to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys necessary to furnish current data on subjects covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major censuses authorized by Title 13, United States Code. This survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will provide continuing and timely national statistical data on 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale trade for the period between economic censuses. The 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Economic Censuses are currently being tabulated. The data collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this survey will be within the general scope and nature of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquiries covered in the economic censuses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Census Bureau will require selected firms operating merchant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale establishments in the United States (with sales size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the probability of selection) to report in the 1994 Annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trade Survey. We will furnish report forms to the firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by this survey and will require their submission within thirty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to amend our preliminary determination (59 FR 48284, September 20, 1994) with regard
to respondents Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda, and to the ``all-others'' rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 12, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) made its affirmative preliminary determination
of sales at less than fair value (59 FR 48284, September 20, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 16, 1994, Grupo Andes, Grupo Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental, and the Prisma Group alleged that the
Department, in making its determination, made ministerial errors which led to the application of best information
available (BIA). They requested that the Department correct the ministerial errors, amend its preliminary determination,
and recalculate the all others rate. In addition, Grupo Andes requested that the Department reverse its preliminary
decision not to verify its information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 21, 1994, counsel for Grupo Andes, Grupo Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental and the Prisma Group met with
officials of the Department of Commerce (see the September 22, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex-parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 memorandum). Also on September 21, 1994, the Caicedo Group alleged that the Department made ministerial errors in
calculating its dumping margin and requested that the Department correct these errors and amend the preliminary
determination. On September 21, 1994, petitioner submitted comments opposing respondents' ministerial error
allegations and their request to amend the preliminary determination. On September 22, 1994, counsel for petitioner
met with officials of the Department of Commerce (see the September 22, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex-parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 memorandum). On September 23, 1994, petitioner submitted a written summary of its September 22, 1994, meeting comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 26, 1994, Grupo Tropicales alleged that the Department made ministerial errors in calculating its dumping
margin and requested that the Department correct these errors and amend the preliminary determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment of Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that the allegations of the Caicedo Group, Grupo Intercontinental, Grupo Prisma,
and Grupo Tropicales involved issues that were other than clerical or ministerial in nature. Consequently, we are
not amending our preliminary determination with respect to these companies. However, we are amending the preliminary
determination for Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda. Accordingly, we have recalculated the ``all others'' rate. Set
forth below is the basis for our amended preliminary determination with respect to these companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not our normal practice to amend preliminary determinations since these determinations only establish estimated
margins, which are subject to verification and which may change in the final determination. However, because of the
specific facts pertaining to this investigation, the Department has determined to amend its preliminary determination
to correct for the significant ministerial errors involved. See the Department's proposed 19 CFR 353.15(g)(4) (57
FR 1131, 1132 (January 10, 1992)); Amendment to Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Sweaters
Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber from Hong Kong, 55 Fed. Reg. 19289&hyph;90 (May 9, 1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Grupo Andes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether Grupo Andes had a viable home market for the preliminary determination, the Department relied
upon the narrative of Grupo Andes's July 22 submission, which indicated that its home market was not viable when, in
its appendix to this submission, Grupo Andes provided data which demonstrated that its home market was viable. Thus,
although there was data on the record which established that Andes' home market was viable, we did not pursue further
Grupo Andes home market sales data for the preliminary determination. Therefore, the Department's initial viability
determination for Grupo Andes was erroneous, as was the Department's decision not to take additional action in regard
to Grupo Andes' home market sales. Therefore, the Department was left with no option but to preliminarily assign Grupo
Andes a margin based on BIA. Because the Department considers its initial unintentional error to be ministerial,
and because correction of that error would result in a change of at least 5 absolute percentage points in, but not less
than 25 percent of, the preliminary margin for Grupo Andes, that error constitutes a significant ministerial error
under proposed 19 CFR 353.15(g)(4) (57 Fed. Reg. 1131, 1132 (January 10, 1992)), the Department's proposed regulation
for correcting significant ministerial errors in preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations.
The Department thus has determined to amend its preliminary determination to establish a preliminary margin for
Grupo Andes based upon its data on the administrative record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department further will (1) require Grupo Andes to submit its home market sales listing; (2) investigate, if necessary,
whether Grupo Andes made home market sales at prices below its cost of production; and (3) conduct verification of
all information submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Grupo Benilda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two business days before the Department's preliminary determination, Grupo Benilda filed a pre-verification submission
which appeared to contain such extensive additions and corrections to its original response as to constitute an entirely
new response. The Department thus determined initially that the submission called into question the integrity of
the response as a whole and preliminarily assigned Grupo Benilda a margin based on BIA. Subsequently, the Department
has determined that Grupo Benilda's September 8 submission, rather than representing a new response, in fact contained
minor data corrections to its response. Because that initial determination in regard to the September 8 submission
was an unintentional error which the Department considers to be ministerial, and because correction of that error
would lead to a change of at least 5 absolute percentage points in, but not less than 25 percent of, the preliminary margin
for Grupo Benilda, that error constitutes a significant ministerial error pursuant to the Department's proposed
regulation outlined above. The Department thus has determined to amend its preliminary determination to establish
a preliminary margin for Grupo Benilda based upon its data on the administrative record prior to its September 8 submission.

C. All Others Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the preliminary dumping margins for Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda have changed, the preliminary weighted-average
``all others'' rate has also changed. (See Suspension of Liquidation section of this notice, below.)

Fair Value Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of fresh cut roses from Colombia to the United States were made at less than fair value, we
compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. For all U.S. prices, we used weighted-average monthly U.S.
prices (see the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum).

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For sales by both Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of
the Trade Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), when the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the
United States prior to importation and when exporter's sales price (ESP) methodology was not otherwise indicated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, where certain sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States,
we based USP on ESP, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made company-specific adjustments, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Grupo Andes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Grupo Andes, we calculated purchase price based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United
States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for foreign inland freight, air freight, U.S. Customs duties, U.S. and Colombian indirect selling expenses including
inventory carrying costs, and U.S. direct selling expenses including credit expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For roses that were further manufactured into bouquets after importation, we adjusted for all value added in the United
States, including the proportional amount of profit or loss attributable to the value added, pursuant to section
772(e)(3) of the Act. We added packing to reported U.S. prices. For the cost of merchandise subject to further manufacturing,
in addition to the adjustments cited in the section on FMV, below, for constructed value, we (1) corrected the U.S.
general expenses to reflect a percentage of cost of goods sold, and (2) recalculated interest expense to exclude the
CV offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Grupo Benilda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Grupo Benilda, we calculated purchase price based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United
States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for foreign inland freight, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. brokerage and handling expenses, credit expenses,
Colombian Flower Council expenses, the greater of U.S. commissions to the related reseller or U.S. indirect selling
expenses incurred, Colombian indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs and other indirect
selling expenses. For those ESP sales where Grupo Benilda did not report airfreight, U.S. duty, and U.S. brokerage
and handling expenses, we applied, as BIA, the highest reported value for each such expense (see the Department's
September 9, 1994, concurrence memorandum.)

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of fresh cut roses in the home market to serve as a viable basis
for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of roses to the volume of third country sales of roses
in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that Grupo Benilda had
a viable home market with respect to sales of roses during the POI and, therefore, we based FMV for Grupo Benilda on home
market sales where those sales were above the cost of production. For Grupo Andes, we based FMV on constructed value
(CV). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We based FMV for Grupo Benilda on two six-month periods. Period one is January 1993 through June 1993, and period two
is July 1993 through December 1993. For a further discussion of these periods, see the September 12, 1994, concurrence
memorandum.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Grupo Andes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Grupo Andes, we calculated FMV based on CV, in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We calculated CV based
on Grupo Andes' cost of cultivation, plus general expenses, profit and packing in the United States. For total general
expenses, including selling and financial expenses (SG&amp;A), we used the greater of reported general expenses
or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For CV profit, we used the greater of the weighted-average
reported profit during the POI or statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and general expenses,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.50(a)(2) and section 773(e)(B) of the Act. We adjusted Grupo Andes' CV data (1) to correct
the export quantity sold to agree to information reported in the supplemental section A; and (2) to base selling and
packing expenses on information provided in the sales response.

 For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for direct selling expenses including credit expenses.
We also deducted from CV the weighted-average indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs up
to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because we found ``reasonable grounds to believe or suspect'' that Grupo Benilda sold roses in Colombia at prices
below their COP, we initiated a COP investigation to determine whether it had home market sales that were made at less
than their respective COPs, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. (See the September 8, 1994, memorandum from
Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we examined whether Benilda sold roses below the cost of production in
significant quantities over an extended period of time. In keeping with our practice involving perishable products,
if more than 50 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales of roses, on a model-specific basis, were at prices above the COP, we
did not disregard any below-cost sales pursuant to section 773(b) of the Act, because we determined that Grupo Benilda's
below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities within an extended period of time. (See Certain Fresh Winter
Vegetables From Mexico 45 FR 20512 (1980).) If between 50 and 90 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales, on a model-specific
basis, were at prices below the COP, and the below cost sales were made within an extended period of time, we disregarded
only the below-cost sales. Where we found that more than 90 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales, on a model-specific basis,
were at prices below the COP, we disregarded all sales and calculated FMV based on CV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In order to determine whether Grupo Benilda's home market sales were above the COP, we calculated COP based on the sum
of Grupo Benilda's cost of cultivation, general expenses, and packing; we calculated CV based on the sum of Grupo Benilda's
COP plus profit. For total general expenses, including selling and financial expenses, (SG&amp;A) we used the greater
of reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For CV profit, we used
the greater of the weighted-average reported profit during the POI or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the
cost of cultivation and general expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.50(a)(2) and section 773(e)(B) of the Act.
We adjusted Grupo Benilda's COP and CV data to (1) correct an error in the company's calculation of average interest
expense; (2) include the entire amount of the 1993 labor bonus; and (3) disallow the company's exclusion of certain
G&amp;A expenses.

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we compared Grupo Benilda's U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level
of trade, where possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For those home market sales above the cost of production, we based FMV on packed, f.o.b. farm prices to unrelated customers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For home market price to purchase price comparisons, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale
adjustments, were appropriate, for differences in credit expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For home market price to ESP comparisons, we made deductions for the weighted-average home market indirect selling

selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales or related-party commissions paid on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR
353.56(b)(1). We also made deductions, for home market credit expenses. For all price-to-price comparisons, we
also deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the
Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Department's final results of administrative review, the dumping margin for Pulton roller chain sold or imported
into the United States during the periods April 1, 1981, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 31, 1982, and April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, was 15.92 percent. Pulton's dumping margin for those final
results was based on best information available (BIA), in accordance with Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended, (the Act) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department revised its final results with respect to Pulton for the 1981&hyph;1982
and 1982&hyph;1983 administrative reviews of roller chain from Japan. On the basis of the BIA margins sanctioned
by the CIT, we determined that the revised weighted-average margin for Pulton for the period April 1, 1981, through
March 31, 1982, is 5.22 percent and the weighted-average margin for Pulton for the period April 1, 1982, through March

Section IV.C.1. of each agreement specifies that the Department will issue the DOC observed market price on October
1, 1994, and use it to determine the quota applicable to imports from the various republics during the period October
1, 1994 to March 31, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV.C.1. of each agreement specifies how the components of the market price are reached. In order to determine
the spot market price, the Department utilized the monthly average of the Uranium Price Information System Spot Price
Indicator (UPIS SPI) and the weekly average of the Uranium Exchange Spot Price (Ux Spot). In order to determine the
long-term market price, the Department utilized the weighted average long-term price as determined by the Department
on the basis of information provided by market participants and a simple average of the UPIS Base Price for the months
in which there were new contracts reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our letters to market participants provided a contract summary sheet and directions requesting the submitter to
report his/her best estimate of the future price of merchandise to be delivered in accordance with the contract delivery
schedules (in U.S. dollars per pound U

 equivalent). Using the information reported in the proprietary summary sheets, the Department calculated the present
value of the prices reported for any future deliveries assuming an annual inflation rate of 2.78 percent, which was
derived from a rolling average of the annual GNP Implicit Price Deflator index from the past four years. The Department
used the base quantities reported on the summary sheet for the purpose of weight-averaging the prices of the long-term
contracts submitted by market participants. We then calculated a simple average of the UPIS Base Price and the long-term
price determined by the Department.

Weighting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department used the average spot and long-term volumes of U.S. utility and domestic supplier purchases, as reported
by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), to weight the spot and long-term components of the observed price.
In this instance, we have used purchase data from the period 1989&hyph;1992, as in the previous determination. During
this period, the spot market accounted for 31.39 percent of total purchases, and the long-term market for 68.61 percent.
We were not able to include data from the 1993 EIA Uranium Industry Annual because it has been withheld due to its proprietary
nature.

Calculation Announcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department determined, using the methodology and information described above, that the observed market price
is $11.13. This reflects an average spot market price of $9.33, weighted at 31.39 percent, and an average long-term
contract price of $11.95, weighted at 68.61 percent. Since this price is below the $13.00/lb. minimum expressed in
Appendix A of the agreements, there will be no quota under Section IV.A. of the agreements available to any signatory
republic for the period October 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowing for additional information received since September 12, we have determined that the observed market price
for uranium is $11.13/lb. The Department invites parties to provide pricing information for use in the next price
determination. Any such information should be provided for the record and should be submitted by March 5, 1995.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. app. 2, notice is hereby given that the National Technical
Information Service Advisory Board (the ``Board'') will meet on Monday, November 7, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and
on Tuesday, November 8, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The session on November 8, 1994 will be closed to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board was established under the authority of 15 U.S.C. 3704b(c), and was chartered on September 15, 1989. The Board
is composed of five members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce who are eminent in such fields as information resources
management, information technology, and library and information services. The purpose of the meeting is to review
and make recommendations regarding general policies and operations of NTIS, including policies in connection with
fees and charges for its services. The agenda will include a progress report on NTIS activities, an update on NTIS plans
to assist Depository Libraries, an update on the progress of FedWorld, and a discussion of NTIS' long range plans.
The closed session discussion is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m. on November 8, 1994. The session will be
closed because premature disclosure of the information to be discussed would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of NTIS' business plan.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce is considering three significant changes
in its APO practice: (1) The adoption of a single revised application for an APO containing all of the conditions the
ITA will require concerning the use and limited disclosure of hard copy and electronic APO information; (2) the adoption
of a single, standard APO to be placed on the record of each case by the administering office, and (3) the issuance of
an approved APO list of signatories to the APO. The revised application and APO respond to the concerns and requests
of the Trade Bar that regularly uses our APO procedures. Copies of the proposed revised application for APO and the
proposed standard APO are printed at the end of this notice, and are available in the Central Records Unit. Written
comments will be considered before the ITA issues a final decision regarding this matter, if received not later than
60 days after publication of this notice.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ITA's APO procedures apply to the vast quantity of proprietary information ITA receives in the course of its administrative
antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings from both foreign governments and companies, and
the U.S. domestic industry. The Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, prevents a federal agency from disclosing business
proprietary information unless a specific exemption is provided by statute. Section 777 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
19 U.S.C. 1677a, however, provides an exemption for the ITA from the Trade Secrets Act, and permits limited disclosure
of business proprietary information under an APO to representatives of parties to specific proceedings for which
the proprietary information was submitted. The purpose of limited disclosure is to provide representatives with
the information necessary to fully represent the interests of the parties in open and fair proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ITA last revised its APO application, procedures, and relevant regulations in 1989 in order to implement the provisions
of The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the Omnibus Trade Act) affecting access under APO. The Omnibus
Trade Act broadened the scope of disclosure of business proprietary information under APO, required direct service
of APO information on authorized parties, and established statutory deadlines for the release of APO information.
Given the dramatic increase in the amount of information submitted in ITA's proceedings, as well as in the increased
desire for access to electronic media, the 1989 APO application and procedures reflected ITA's concerns that information
in both hard copy and electronic form be adequately protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these still current procedures, ITA's APO application and the APO itself contain detailed restrictions on
the use and distribution of proprietary information. A party's representative submits an APO application, and the
ITA generally issues an APO to that representative. Except for instances where a party is represented by co-counsel,
a party may have only one representative for each proceeding. If a party wishes to have an additional representative,
it must operate through the single representative. Any time a party wishes to add or change a representative, it must
file an additional APO application, and the ITA will issue an amended APO.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After 5 years of experience with the 1989 procedures, and after consultation with the Bar Committee representing
the International Law Section of the District of Columbia Bar, the Section of International Law and Practice of the
American Bar Association, the International Trade Commission Trial Lawyers Association, and the Customs and International
Trade Bar Association (the Committee), we believe it is time to reevaluate and revise our procedures. The Committee
polled its members on various issues. Through this cooperative effort, the ITA is proposing changes that reduce the
micromanagement of a representative's handling of business proprietary information, allow for two independent
representatives to have APOs in a proceeding, and provide for the issuance of a single APO on the record in each proceeding,
rather than the issuance of multiple APOs to each representative. We believe that the proposed changes will provide
for effective and practicable protection of business proprietary information, expedite issuance of APOs and APO
amendments, and reduce the number of APO violations.

Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to the APO application and the procedures are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Revised Application for APO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the recommendation of the Committee, we propose removing overly restrictive conditions in the application for
APO and the APO itself, while retaining the critical restrictions necessary to protect the APO information. The proposed
changes will streamline the process for both the parties and the ITA. Under current procedures, ITA issues one APO
for proprietary information submitted on hard copy, and a different APO for proprietary information submitted on
electronic medium, the so-called ``computer tape'' APO. The tape APO contains numerous additional restrictions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed APO application incorporates three restrictions concerning electronic data and eliminates additional
conditions that the ITA has traditionally placed in its computer tape APOs. The significant changes to the APO application
are set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed APO application (Items 1 and 7) allows a party to the proceeding to have two independent representatives.
Item 7 of the application defines a ``representative'' as an attorney or non-legal specialist associated with a single
firm, who is acting on behalf of the party to the proceeding. Separate applications can be filed by applicants from
more than one law firm or non-legal specialist firm acting on behalf of the party or parties to the proceeding. When
an interested party has representatives from two different firms, the lead representative that will be the primary
contact for the Department must be identified. A ``lead'' representative must be designated either in the transmittal
letter to the ITA, or in the APO application, if more than one representative is retained. A non-legal specialist may
function as the ``lead'' representative. The ITA does not wish to consider authorizing more than two representatives
(i.e., firms) on behalf of a party as it may cause confusion and create difficulties in administering the proceeding.

The current application for APO requires that an attorney assume responsibility for a non-legal ``other representative''
if an attorney has been retained to represent a party to the proceeding. The proposed modification will allow a party
greater flexibility in its choice of representation and would allow a party to hire a second representative, an economic
consultant or ``other representative,'' separate from a law firm. In addition, the ITA will only allow a non-legal
representative access to proprietary information if that representative has a relatively active practice before
the ITA, so that barring practice before the ITA is an effective sanction in the event the representative abuses the
APO system. In this circumstance, the ITA will consider the non-attorney applicant's established practice before
the ITA and proven reliability before granting the requested APO.

Word Processing Duplication of APO Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed APO application (Item 2) allows the applicant to produce page 1, and the names of the representatives
and their affiliations (Items 29 and 30) on a word processing system to facilitate the application process. To prevent
unauthorized alteration of the content of the substantive requirements contained in the application, the main body
of the application may only be photocopied by the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties have requested that the ITA consider allowing the entire application to be reproduced on the applicant's
word processing system to facilitate the application process. Based on prior practice we do not find this acceptable
because of the possibility of an inadvertent error in the preparation of the application by the applicant, and because
ITA would be required to review every application to ensure it was consistent with the standard form. In the past the
ITA allowed applicants to submit versions of the ITA's applications that had been prepared on the applicants' own
word processing system, and at times found that applicants made significant changes. The increased review time made
it difficult for the ITA to issue APOs in a timely fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the concerns of the Bar Committee's request, however, we have revised the format of the application containing
the terms and conditions of disclosure, and are proposing that the sections of the application that require typing
from the representatives be reproduced on the applicants' word processing system. Page 1 of the application identifies
the case and the segment of the proceeding in which access to proprietary data is being sought. It also identifies the
request as the original application or an amended request. Items 29 and 30 require the applicant's name, signature,
date of application, firm, and the identification of admission to a bar or court if an attorney, and any professional
associations for a non-attorney ``other representative''. The main body of the application, however, may only be
photocopied by the applicant. In continuing to require that the main portion of the application be photocopied only,
and allowing page 1, and Items 29 and 30 to be reproduced on a word processing system, the ITA will limit the time necessary
for administrative review, and also facilitate the application process for the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative is to permit a representative to reproduce the entire form on its word processing equipment, but certify
that it is identical to the ITA standard form, and agree that any if there are any discrepancies, the parties are bound
by the standard form. We invite comments on these proposals.

Time Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITA is searching for a practice that will reduce the number of untimely applications. In accordance with the current
regulations, the present application sets forth strict deadlines. Timeliness in submitting an application for
APO continues to be a major issue of concern for the ITA and the applicant. The ITA does not wish to impair a party's ability
to fully represent its client. The ITA, however, must impose an application deadline in order to properly administer
the APO function, and the earlier in the proceeding, the more efficient the process for the ITA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed application changes the deadline as set forth in 19 CFR 353.34(b) or 355.34(b) to require that the application
be filed with the first written submission made by a party after it has retained a representative, but in no event later
than the date the case briefs are due (Item 5). A written submission is any written correspondence by a representative
with the ITA in the course of an AD or CVD proceeding on behalf of a party to the proceeding. The proposed change in this
area mandates a firm deadline, however it will allow greater flexibility for a party to retain a representative at
a later date in the proceeding. The representative must apply for an APO with its first written submission made on behalf
of its client. Failure to apply at that time would result in a subsequently filed application for APO being denied as
untimely. Applications filed after the date the case briefs are due will not be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative is to require parties to file a notice of appearance, and to file the APO application with the notice
of appearance. The ITA also intends to remind parties in its notices of initiation of a proceeding to file an early APO
application. We invite comment on these two proposals, as well as other suggestions on what procedures the ITA can
implement to obtain timely APO applications early in proceedings.

Electronic Business Proprietary Information Defined
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed application defines the term ``electronic data'' to include (1) proprietary data submitted by a party,
generated by the ITA, or entered by the recipient on computer tape, disk, diskette, or any other electronic computer
medium, and (2) all electronic work products resulting from manipulation of this data, as transferred in any form
onto any other electronic computer medium, such as tape, disk, diskette, Bernoulli cartridge, removable disk pack,
etc. (Item 9 of the proposed APO application).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``electronic data'' has been defined in the ITA's current ``computer tape'' APOs. Because the ITA will no
longer issue applicant-specific ``computer tape'' APOs under the proposed system, the definition has been moved
to the application. The conditions that the ITA will require for the routine use and protection of ``electronic data''
will be in the application. The specific ``computer tape'' requirements to ensure protection of electronic information
are discussed below.

Request for Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed application requires all parties to obtain an APO covering all business proprietary information submitted
in the proceeding, but allows the applicant the choice of receiving hard copy information only, or hard copy and electronic
information (Item 10 of the proposed application). Furthermore, parties may waive the right to be served with the
business proprietary information of other parties in which they have no interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute and regulations provide for the release of all business proprietary information in a proceeding (19 U.S.C.
1677f(c)(1)(A) and 19 CFR &sect;353.34 or 355.34). In practice, however, the ITA has not always required parties
to request all proprietary information, and has allowed parties to request only the information they wanted to receive.
For administrative convenience, in the 1992 steel investigations the ITA asked parties to request access to ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 business proprietary information'' under APO. We have continued this practice in current proceedings, and most
parties are now routinely requesting access to all proprietary information under APO. Furthermore, as in the steel
investigations, parties may waive the right to be served with the business proprietary submissions of other respondents
in which they have no interest. Respondents' counsel will, however, be required to accept submissions by petitioners
that may contain business proprietary information of several parties. The adoption of this practice will allow parties
to prepare only one APO version of business proprietary documents and will not require the preparation of multiple
APO-specific versions for each party. Additionally, it will reduce the possibility of APO violations because all
parties subject to APO will have access to all information. In order to ensure that parties are provided with a means
of identification for multiple source data in submissions, the ITA will amend &sect;&sect;353.32 and 355.32 of the
Department of Commerce's regulations to provide specific instruction concerning the identification of this information.
This will greatly assist all parties in providing their clients with needed information to present their case while
minimizing the risk of inadvertent disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APO application also provides the applicant with the choice of receiving hard copy information only, or hard copy
and electronic information. Should the applicant choose to receive electronic information, the applicant does
not need to provide any additional documentation to the ITA concerning this portion of the APO request. The ITA will
no longer require an explanation of the applicant's computer system or the procedures that will be followed in working
with information in electronic form because the applicant will now be required to establish its own procedures to
ensure the protection of APO information in electronic and hard copy form. The Bar Committee emphasized that it was
not necessary for the ITA to set forth specific requirements/restrictions in the application or the APO because they
were unnecessary and overly restrictive, considering the experience that has been gained by the Trade Bar in working
with business proprietary information subject to APO.

Internal Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A primary area of concern noted by the Bar Committee is the ITA's perceived micromanagement of the APO area. Under current
APO practice, specific procedures are mandated by the application and APO. In our discussions, the Bar Committee
frequently stressed the experience that has been gained by the Trade Bar in working with business proprietary information
subject to APO. The Bar Committee emphasized that it was not necessary for the ITA to set forth detailed requirements
or restrictions in the application or in the APO, such as the requirement that the use of APO data be restricted to the
business office premises, the prohibition concerning the facsimile transmission of APO data, or the requirement
that an APO Log be maintained. In response to this concern, we have removed these requirements and restrictions from
the proposed application, and now require the applicant to establish its own internal procedures to protect the APO
information, rather than have the procedures mandated by ITA (Item 13 of the application). To assist a party in establishing
its own adequate internal procedures, the ITA will maintain guidelines concerning general procedures for protecting
APO information and more specific suggestions concerning the establishment of written office procedures. The quality
of a party's internal procedures will be taken into consideration by the ITA in an APO violation investigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The major burden we are placing on parties is that they adopt procedures to ensure that the applicant does not disclose
any of the APO information to anyone other than the submitter and other persons authorized to have access to the information
in accordance with the requirements set forth in the DOC's regulations. We are continuing to require that the applicant
use the information solely for the segment of the ITA proceeding in which it is submitted. Any other use of the information,
including its use before the International Trade Commission in its proceeding, is a violation of the ITA's APO.

Protection of Electronic Business Proprietary Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed application prohibits the applicant from seeking assistance from the ITA in handling or processing
electronic data/medium served on the applicant by a party other than the ITA (Item 14 of the application). In an effort
to reduce the complexity of the proposed standard APO, and to avoid any misconceptions on this matter, we have included
this condition from the ``computer tape'' APOs in the proposed application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ITA is responsible for conducting its proceedings within statutory deadlines and does not possess the capability
of providing instruction to parties who may be unfamiliar with computer processing. Should a party experience difficulty
in handling or processing electronic data/media served on them pursuant to an APO, the party should seek assistance
from the provider of the information. The ITA, of course, will provide appropriate assistance concerning electronic
information prepared and released by the ITA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed application requires the applicant to ensure that APO information entered on computers will only be
resident in the computer at times when programs are actually being run, and will not be accessible via modem or network
(Items 15 and 16). These requirements are also taken from the ``computer tape'' APOs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ITA's ``computer tape'' APOs have been a major area of concern for the Trade Bar. Generally it is felt that the ITA
has been overly restrictive in its requirements concerning electronic data. The standard ``computer tape'' requirements
were developed in response to the Court of International Trade's directive that the ITA craft an administrative protective
order specifically designed to provide a heightened degree of protection necessary to protect sensitive electronic
data. In light of the experience we have now gained in routinely releasing this information under APO, and in view of
the comments we have received from the Trade Bar, we have determined that two conditions, as set forth in items 15 and
16 of the application, are critical to the protection of this sensitive data. Electronic information resident in
a computer is most vulnerable. Therefore, we believe that electronic data released under APO should only be resident
in a computer when it is actually being used (Item 15). At the time it is resident in the computer and programs are actually
being run, access via modem or network must be rendered impossible (Item 16). Compliance with these two conditions
will prevent unauthorized access via electronic means.

Certification Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two separate certification requirements in the proposed application. The first concerns the departure
of a representative from a firm, and the second concerns the transition from an ITA APO to a judicial protective order.
The proposed application requires the applicant to certify to the ITA compliance with the terms of the APO prior to
departure from the applicant's current firm, and to submit a new application if appropriate (Item 17). This procedure
does not change the established practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the current application requires an applicant to notify the ITA if any of the facts in the application change,
many parties are not certain of the procedures that should be followed when an individual subject to an APO leaves a
firm prior to the completion of the proceeding. Item 17 provides particular guidance to the applicant, and sets forth
within the application specific procedures to be followed. Additionally, the proposed APO Guidelines outline the
preferred procedure for handling the transfer of APO information should a change in representation occur during
the course of a segment of a proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed application requires the applicant to certify to the return or destruction of the APO information within
ten business days of the expiration of the time for filing for judicial or panel review at the end of the case (Item 18).
Failure to do so is a violation of the APO. The ITA is making renewed efforts to ensure that this important provision
is strictly adhered to. The ITA is publishing reminders in its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices reminding parties about this requirement. In the proposed application, we have significantly increased
from the two-day time limit required by the current application. The current application requires that applicants
certify to the return or destruction of APO information within two business days of the expiration of the time for filing
for, or intervening in, a judicial or panel review at the end of the case. The increase in time to ten business days allows
the applicant sufficient time to be notified of a judicial or panel appeal. The ITA has routinely granted extensions
to this deadline when requested, and will adjust this deadline for the convenience of the parties. The extended deadline
is reasonable, and does not compromise the security of the APO information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed application requires the applicant to provide a copy of the judicial protective order (JPO) to the appropriate
ITA official (Item 19). This will assist the ITA in tracking the certifications required by Item 18 above. This item
provides the ITA with an additional safeguard to confirm that APO information is properly protected at the conclusion
of a case. The certification required by Item 18, or a copy of a JPO required by this condition, will assist the ITA in
tracking the final disposition of materials released under APO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Items 3, 4 and 6 provide basic instructions for the filing and service of the application, and refer the applicant to
the appropriate sections of the ITA regulations that pertain to the release of proprietary information under APO.
Items 20 through 25 require the applicant to (1) acknowledge sanctions for the breach of the conditions of the protective
order, (2) inform the ITA if any of the facts in the application change during the existence of the requested APO, (3)
affirm that all statements in the application are true, accurate, and complete, (4) agree to be bound by the terms stated
in the APO, (5) assume responsibility for the violation of the APO by any employees of the firm who are granted access
to APO information, and (6) identify the party represented. Items 26 and 27 require an attorney applicant or non-attorney
applicant to answer particular questions concerning any other relationship the applicant may have with that party.
Item 28 requires the identification and signatures of support staff and reiterates the assumption of responsibility
for any violation of the protective order by those individuals.

(2) The Proposed Standard APO
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are proposing that a standard APO be placed on the record of each segment of a proceeding shortly after the initiation
notice is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It should be understood that the ``standard APO'' will be specific to each segment of a proceeding, thereby allowing
for modifications, if necessary, to fit the specific circumstances of different proceedings. Generally, however,
the standard APO is the version on which we are seeking comment. The ITA's current practice is to issue one standard
APO to all of the applicants from the same firm; ``other representatives'' retained by the attorney or non-attorney
representative are listed on the same APO. The placement of one APO on the record of each segment of the proceeding would
eliminate specific APOs for the separate parties and streamline the administrative process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed APO contains the standard language that is already used in ITA APOs, and requires the release of all business
proprietary information in a proceeding which the submitting party agrees to release or the ITA determines to release,
except for the information noted below that is exempt from APO release in accordance with statute and regulations:
customer names in an investigation only (Section 135(b) of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 specifically amended
Section 777 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677f) to prohibit the release of customer names by Commerce during
any investigation which requires an injury determination by the International Trade Commission until either an
order is published as a result of the investigation or the investigation is suspended or terminated.); privileged
information; classified information; and specific information of a type for which the ITA determines there is a clear
and compelling need to withhold from disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed APO sets forth three procedures regarding electronic data. Procedures 1 and 2 are taken from the current
``computer tape'' APO. Procedure 1 requires direct service of electronic data on a party authorized to receive information
in this form and requires that the electronic information submitted to the ITA be APO releasable in its entirety. Procedure
2 requires the requesting party to pay the submitter of the electronic data for copying costs and the medium if the applicant
requests access to information in electronic form. Procedure 2 does not, however, set a recommended price structure
for the electronic data/medium. Although current ``computer tape'' APOs suggest a price limit for the reproduction
costs of a computer tape or floppy disk/diskette, we do not believe that the ITA should be involved in pricing materials
over which we have no direct knowledge. The APO requires the party requesting electronic data to pay all reasonable
costs incurred by the submitter of the data for the copying of its electronic data released to the applicant. It states
that reasonable costs may include the cost of the electronic medium and the cost of copying the complete proprietary
version of the electronic data/medium submitted to the ITA in APO releasable form. The APO further states that the
amount charged for copying the electronic data may not include costs borne by the submitter of the electronic data
in the creation of the electronic data/medium submitted to the ITA for use in presenting its case. Procedure 3 releases
electronic data generated by the ITA through established procedures. The ITA has not released its own proceeding-specific
computer programs and resulting output in electronic form under APO on a routine basis. Procedures are now being developed
to provide for the release of this information when it is requested. We have not required that all parties ask for release
of electronic data in order to limit proliferation of information in this sensitive form.

(3) The Proposed APO Service List
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final change to ITA procedures implementing a streamlined APO process is the issuance of an ITA APO Service List
that contains the names of the approved applicants. The ITA's current practice is to (1) issue a specific standard
APO to the representatives of a party from the same firm or firms, (2) send a letter to parties to the proceeding who are
required to serve proprietary information as a result of the APO being issued, and (3) amend the APO as requests for
amendment are submitted. The adoption of an APO Service List would provide a single list designating all parties authorized
to receive proprietary information under the APO. As requests for amendment are received, the APO Service List would
be amended. The proposed APO list would be made available to parties through the Central Records Unit, in Room B&hyph;099
of the main Commerce building.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adoption of this procedure would not, however, address the responsibility of the ITA to provide the APO Service
List to counsel who are not located in the Washington, DC. area and parties who do not have counsel and are, also, not
located in the Washington, DC. area. In the foreseeable future, the ITA intends to make the service list available
electronically, and parties can easily determine who is on the service list. In the meantime, we welcome proposals
on how out-of-town parties can most efficiently receive timely notice of the service list.

Should there be an objection to either the issuance of an APO to a particular party, or an objection to the release of
particular information, the ITA will continue to address these issues in a separate decision memorandum in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(c) or 355.34(c).

Additional Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bar Committee requested that the ITA consider alternate means of providing expedited treatment for APO approval.
One proposal was to allow one lead signatory to apply from each law firm or consulting firm and to give that individual
the authority and responsibility for granting access to other professionals within the firm. We do not believe that
this is a workable procedure because it does not permit any representative or the ITA to know who has access to APO material
at a given moment. Nor does it permit other parties to the proceeding an opportunity to comment on the acceptability
of the individual seeking access under APO. While the ITA does not seek approval from parties prior to the granting
of an APO, the ITA does consider objections if any are made. ITA regulations require that the application for APO be
served on all parties to the proceeding in order to notify all parties of the APO request and to provide the opportunity
for comment. If an applicant needed expedited approval on a request for an amended APO, approval could be obtained
by the applicant from the parties whose information would be disclosed under the APO prior to the submission of the
APO application, which would then preclude need for a comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another proposal was to have the ITA approve a roster of members of a representative's firm, and the lead representative
could add any member of the roster to its APO at any time. If a roster is approved by the ITA, however, it might be just as
easy to add all approved members to the service list when they are approved. The ITA seeks comments on these approaches
and any other suggestions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was also suggested that the ITA provide ``APO Guidelines'' to assist firms in handling business proprietary information
released under APO. The ITA will make ``APO Guidelines'' available, and will also hold a public training session on
implementation of the changes that are adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Committee report addressed the problem of public summaries at length but did not propose any solutions.
The ITA is a strong advocate of public summaries that a representative can use for a constructive dialogue with his
or her client. We invite proposals to address the problems parties have in making public summaries of proprietary
information.

The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 15, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by Consolidated International Automotive, Inc.
(petitioner). At the request of the Department of Commerce (the Department), petitioner filed supplements to support
and clarify the petition's data on September 30 and October 3, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12 (1994), petitioner
alleges that wheel inserts from Taiwan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value
within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially
injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section
771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject
to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9)
of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, such party should file a written notification
with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty
order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. The procedures
and requirements regarding the filing of such requests are contained in 19 CFR 353.14.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are wheel inserts, also referred to as lug hole inserts and insert bushings,
made from steel, aluminum, brass or zinc. A wheel insert is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washer-like product with a circular collar that protrudes into a stud hole to provide a protective seat between a lug
nut and an aluminum or alloy wheel mounted on ground transportation vehicles. A wheel insert can be heat-treated or
non heat-treated, with or without knurls, and with or without surface coatings. Surface coatings include, but are
not limited to, chrome plating, nickel plating, zinc plating (with or without wax coating), oxide coating and powder
coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The products under investigation are currently classifiable under subheading 8708.70.6060 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

United States Price and Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based United States Price (USP) on a November 1993 price quotation obtained for a standard black zinc plated
wheel insert. The terms of the price quotation were FOB Kaohsiung, Taiwan, with payment based on an irrevocable sight
letter of credit (L/C). Petitioner made a deduction for credit. Credit was calculated using the short term interest
rate published by Taiwanese banks for September of 1993 and a credit period of 55 days, the average of the 50&hyph;60
days stated on the price quotation for delivery after receipt of the L/C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner based its estimate of foreign market value (FMV) on constructed value (CV) claiming that no producers
in Taiwan sell the subject merchandise in Taiwan or to any third country markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to 19 CFR 353.12(b)(7), if petitioner is unable to furnish information on foreign sales or costs, it must
provide information on production costs in the United States and then adjust these costs to reflect for differences
in the production costs between the United States and the home market country of exportation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To calculate constructed value, petitioner adjusted its own manufacturing costs for a standard black zinc plated
wheel insert for known differences in costs between the United States and Taiwan. We adjusted the reported material
costs to account for revenue received by petitioner from the sale of scrap material. Because the plating costs included
selling, general and administrative expenses as well as the profit of petitioner's plater, we have adjusted the plating
expenses to exclude these amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For overhead, utilities were adjusted using a ratio of Taiwanese to U.S. electricity costs. Other components of petitioner's
overhead were adjusted using the ratio of Taiwanese to U.S. labor costs. Certain components of overhead were not adjusted
by petitioner. Because we view this industry sufficiently labor intensive to justify using the ratio of Taiwanese
to U.S. labor costs to adjust overhead, we have applied the labor ratio uniformly to all components of overhead (except
utilities). Additionally, because petitioner allocated overhead expenses (inclusive of expenses related to petitioner's
plating operation) over payroll expenses (exclusive of plating wages), we have added plating wages to petitioner's
calculation of payroll expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner provided two hourly wage rates for Taiwanese manufacturing workers, one obtained from private research,
the other obtained from a public source. Because of the Department's preference for publicly available information,
we selected the latter and adjusted it as follows: 1) we disallowed petitioner's inclusion of an annual bonus because
petitioner's wage rate calculation did not include bonuses; and 2) we inflated the wage rate for one year instead of
two, as calculated by petitioner, because we determined that the wage rate was from 1992. The statutory minimum percentages
of 10 percent for selling, general and administrative expenses and eight percent for profit were relied upon in petitioner's
calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the above adjustments were made, the recalculated dumping margin for wheel inserts produced on a screw machine
is 46.28 percent.

Initiation of Investigation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 732(c) of the Act, the Department must determine, within 20 days after a petition is filed, whether
a petition sets forth an allegation necessary for the initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether
the petition contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have examined the petition for wheel inserts from Taiwan, as amended, and have found that it meets the requirements
of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether
imports of wheel inserts from Taiwan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.
If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determination by February 22, 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITC will determine by October 30, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of wheel inserts
from Taiwan are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a)
of the Act, a negative ITC determination will result in the investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation
will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

18101). Interested parties were invited to comment on the proposed conversion. No comments were received concerning
the scope of the suspended countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products from Colombia; therefore,
no changes have been made.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1985, the Department suspended the countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products and apparel
from Colombia (C&hyph;301&hyph;401) (50 FR 9863; March 12, 1985). The scope of the suspended investigation was originally
defined solely in terms of the TSUSA item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1, 1989,
the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the HTS, pursuant to section 1211 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness
Act of 1988. The suspended investigation was terminated in 1990, and the HTS conversion was never implemented. However,
the Court of International Trade (CIT) ordered that the suspended investigation be reinstated (except with regard
to apparel from Colombia) in its decision dated May 7, 1992 (

1993 (

, 6f.3d 756). As a result, the suspended investigation was reinstated effective May 18, 1992 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 54552, October 22, 1993, and decision memorandum dated February 25, 1994). Therefore, the Department took action
to conform the scope of the investigation with the tariff classification system of the HTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. International Trade Commission, analyzed
the TSUSA-defined scope and identified those HTS numbers that reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined scope
of the subject suspended investigation. On April 15, 1994, the Department published a proposed conversion (59 FR
18108) and invited interested parties to comment on this proposed conversion. Because no comments were received,
the Department has not changed the HTS numbers for the scope of the suspended investigation on certain textile mill
products from Colombia from those published in the proposed conversion. The HTS numbers for this suspended countervailing
duty investigation are found in the attached Appendix.

Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Relocation of Navy Reservists From the Naval Reserve
Readiness Center at Lake Union and the Replacement of the Army Reserve Center at Fort Lawton, Seattle, WA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and 40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508, the Army Reserve and Navy
Reserve will prepare an EIS for the relocation of the Naval Reserve Readiness Center at Lake Union and the replacement
of Army Reserve training facilities currently located in the 500 Area of Fort Lawton.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acting as Joint Lead Agencies, Chief of the Naval Reserve and the U.S. Army Reserve will analyze the environmental
impacts of alternative approaches to meeting each agency's needs. In conducting the analysis, the lead agencies
will involve the public and other agencies. The process will be documented in Draft and Final Environmental Impact
Statements (EISs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Navy reservists in the Seattle area train at the Naval Reserve Readiness Center at Lake Union, located
near the center of the city. The City of Seattle wishes to acquire that facility and incorporate it into a development
project called the Seattle Commons. In light of this, Congress has requested that the Navy identify and evaluate alternative
locations for a new Reserve Center to replace the Lake Union facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Army Reserve training facilities located within the 500 Area of Fort Lawton are in deteriorating
condition and require replacement. The Army Reserve will consider replacement alternatives of these facilities
in the same EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies' preferred alternative is to construct and operate a new, 120,000 square foot Joint Use Reserve Center
at Fort Lawton. This new facility would be at a different location from the facilities the Army Reserve presently uses
for weekend training and would accommodate the indoor training needs of approximately 1,300 Army and Navy Reservists.
The Chief of Naval Reserve and the U.S. Army Reserve propose that the new Joint Use Reserve Center site be in the southwest
corner of Fort Lawton, near the existing Army Reserve Headquarters offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will evaluate other sites within Fort Lawton, as well as other Federally-owned sites in the Seattle area. The
agencies' decisionmakers will also consider alternatives involving separate, rather than joint facilities. They
will also consider the alternative of taking no action. The evaluations of the reasonable alternatives will be documented
in the EIS and made available for public review and comment before the agencies reach a decision as to how they will meet
their needs for new facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies will hold a public meeting in November to help determine the scope of the EIS. At this meeting the Navy and
the Army will describe the proposed action and will solicit comments from citizens, agencies and organizations about
the issues and the alternatives to be addressed in the EIS. The date and time of the meeting will be publicized in the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Magnolia News.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy Reserve and the Army Reserve welcome comments on the process. Questions about the EIS process may be directed
to Mr. Don Morris At (206) 396&hyph;5976. Comments may be addressed to: Engineering Field Activity, Northwest, Naval
Facilities Engineering Command, (Attn: Don Morris, Code 232DM), 3505 N.W. Anderson Hill Road, Silverdale, WA 98383&hyph;7929.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 3517) requires that the Director of OMB provide
interested Federal agencies and persons an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB
may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval
process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State of Federal law, or substantially interfere
with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director, Office of Information Resources
Management, publishes this notice with attached proposed information collection requests prior to submission
to OMB. For each proposed information collection request, grouped by office, this notice contains the following
information: (1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing, or reinstatement; (2) Title;
(3) Frequency of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting and/or Recordkeeping burden; and (6) Abstract.
Because an emergency review is requested, the additional information to be requested in this collection is included
in the section on ``Additional Information'' in this notice.

Additional Information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Education has requested an emergency review and approval from the Office of Management and
Budget. The Department's requested approval date is October 19, 1994. If the deadline date for transmittal of applications
for Title III eligibility designation is delayed, the Department will not be able to notify institutions of their
eligibility status before mid-April, 1995. Such a delay in the Title III eligibility designation will delay in the
competitions for new awards under Title III Part A Strengthening Institutions Program and Part C Endowment Challenge
Grant Program, and the newly authorized Hispanic-serving Institutions Program. Ultimately, further delay in the
processing of this collection submission will result in severe time constraints for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FY 1995 new grant awards, with the danger that the FY 1995 funds will remain unexpended at the end of the fiscal year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Carbon dioxide can be disposed in the ocean as a gas, solid or liquid. The three most economical methods of ocean disposal
are thought to be hydrate formation, dense plume formation and unconfined release, at depths of 200m-1500m (``A Research
Needs Assessment for the Capture, Utilization and Disposal of Carbon Dioxide from Fossil-Fuel Powered Plants.''
Volume I, Energy Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.; pp. 13&hyph;19 (DE&hyph;FG02&hyph;92ER30194.A000,
August 1993)). Other identifiable, more costly methods of disposal include dry ice injection and very deep ocean
injection.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Through Cooperative Agreements, DOE is proposing to undertake renewable energy commercialization projects through
biomass based renewable energy technologies under provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;486. It is the mutual goal of the DOE and USDA to promote opportunities for rural development and
sustainable power generating capacity by establishing a market infrastructure that integrates dedicated feedstock
supply systems and advanced biomass power production. DOE and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are working
to accelerate the establishment of integrated biomass power production systems through Federally cost shared,
vertically integrated, economically sustainable closed-loop biomass power generation systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents are encouraged to form partnership with the agriculture community, industry, power producers, educational
institutions, State and local governments, and other interested parties, to pursue deployment of integrated biomass
systems. The partnerships shall demonstrate how cooperative efforts can lead to sustaining, economically viable,
closed-loop biomass power generation. The projects selected should focus primarily on the production of power from
energy crops, however, projects proposing coproduction will also be considered if power is the primary output. Projects
proposing the utilization of biomass wastes or residue will also be considered, as long as dedicated energy crops
are the primary fuel source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects selected under this solicitation may be eligible for Federal funds through DOE cost sharing and may also
be eligible for funds through existing USDA authorities and programs. As such, respondents are encouraged to identify
USDA authorities and programs and their applicability to this project. The required end-goal of the program is for
sustaining operations without Federal assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents will be required to submit a feasibility study which addresses technical, environmental and economic
aspects of project implementation and a business plan indicating project sustainability following Federal assistance.
Eleven studies are currently funded through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to evaluate economic
development through biomass technologies and systems. The integrated biomass systems being studied are inclusive
of feedstock production and commercial scale conversion technologies for the production of electric power and liquid
biofuels. Additional information regarding these studies is available upon request through DOE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solicitation number DE&hyph;RP36&hyph;95G010052 will include complete information on the program including
technical aspects, funding, application preparation, and selection and proposal evaluation criteria. Multiple
awards are anticipated, subject to the availability of appropriations on or before September 30, 1995. Issuance
of the solicitation is planned for December 1, 1994 with responses due 120 days following solicitation release. Requests
for the solicitation must be in writing and directed to Ruth E. Adams. Facsimiles are acceptable and can be transmitted
to (303) 275&hyph;4790.

Gas Act, requesting authorization to construct and operate 2.86 miles of 36 inch loop line in Effingham County, Illinois,
to accommodate an additional 32 Mmcf per day of gas from Natural's Loudon Storage Field to the Chicago market area,
all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural states that this proposal will result in the No. 3 line of Natural's Gulf Coast Mainline extending from the
immediate outlet of Natural's Loudon Storage Field northward toward the Chicago market area. It is further stated
that this additional loop will benefit Natural's system by improving the utilization of the existing certificated
peak daily deliverability at Loudon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that the facilities for this project will cost approximately $2.83 million, which Natural proposes
to finance with funds on hand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before October
26, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Natural to appear or
be represented at the hearing.

Summary of the Proposed Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) has an existing natural gas pipeline system consisting
of various diameter pipe that extends from the State of Texas and offshore Louisiana through the Appalachian area
to the Eastern Seaboard in the Philadelphia and New York area. Texas Eastern wants to expand and modify its facilities
to transport an additional 105,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day (Dthd) to CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG)
and wants Commission authorization to construct and operate the following facilities needed to transport those
volumes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;13.9 miles of 36-inch-diameter replacement pipeline in two segments in Pennsylvania: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniontown Discharge mileposts (Mps) 1048.47 to 1058.18 for 9.7 miles in Fayette and Somerset Counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bedford Discharge Mps 1106.65 to 1110.87 for 4.2 miles in Bedford County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;6,500 horsepower (hp) of compression at its existing Uniontown Compressor Station in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Texas Eastern pipeline facilities were originally proposed as part of the Liberty Pipeline Project in Docket
Nos. CP92&hyph;720&hyph;000 and CP92&hyph;720&hyph;001. These facilities were discussed in our Notices of Intent
dated January 22 and December 22, 1993. The Liberty Project applications were dismissed by the Commission without
prejudice on August 12, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG wants to provide transportation of 105,000 Dthd from Texas Eastern to three utilities, an electric generation
plant, and a cogeneration developer. To provide this transportation, CNG wants Commission authorization to construct
and operate about 8,000 hp of compression (two 4,000-hp electric motor-driven compressor units) at a new station
to be known as CNG's Chambersburg Compressor Station, in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Land Requirements for Construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Texas Eastern's proposed replacements would be built adjacent and parallel to existing rights-of-way. Texas Eastern
intends to use an 85-foot-wide construction right-of-way. About 60 feet of the planned 85-foot width would use existing
right-of-way. Consequently, about 25 feet of new clearing would be required in most areas. Following construction,
the disturbed area would be restored and the 25 feet of new clearing would be allowed to revert to its former land use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at areas of steep side
slopes, and in most areas where topsoil would be segregated (agricultural and residential areas). Additional working
space would also be required adjacent to road and stream crossings.

The EA Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are considered during the preparation of the EA. State and local government representatives are encouraged
to notify their constituents of this proposed action and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by Texas Eastern and CNG. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary
list. The list of issues may be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues
are:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing reviewed
an application to amend the license for the Stanley Canyon Hydroelectric Project located on West Monument Creek,
El Paso County, Colorado. The application's major proposed changes are: (1) Construction of a new aboveground regulating
reservoir and underground tailrace and transfer conduits, (2) a shorter and realigned transmission line, and (3)
removal from the project boundary of certain facilities no longer needed for the project. A Final Environmental Assessment
(FEA) was prepared for the application. In the FEA, Commission staff finds that approving the application would not
constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on September 28, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah, 84108, filed the above-referenced abbreviated application, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act,
requesting that the Commission issue an order amending the March 21, 1991 certificate of public convenience and necessity,
in Docket No. CP89&hyph;1525, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to authorize Northwest to utilize, as needed, all available working gas capacity, on an interruptible basis, at the
Jackson Prairie Storage Project (Jackson Prairie), in order to operationally balance transportation services
on Northwest's system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 21, 1991, certificate only authorized Northwest to use up to one Bcf of the available storage working gas
capacity at Jackson Prairie for system balancing. Northwest requests that this one Bcf limitation be lifted, on the
basis that increased flexibility in the use of Jackson Prairie's storage capacity is needed to maintain the integrity
of its system in the open-access transportation, post-Order No. 636 restructuring, environment.

157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization
to construct and operate an additional point of delivery for interruptible transportation service to Gasco Distribution
Systems, Inc. (Gasco) in Morgan County, Ohio, under Columbia's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;76&hyph;000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia proposes to establish a new point of delivery to Gasco at a location where it currently receives volumes from
Gasco. Columbia states that it will deliver up to 100 dekatherms per day, 36,500 annually, to Gasco at the new point.
Columbia further states that the new point has been requested by Gasco for interruptible transportation service
for residential and commercial use. Columbia states that the quantities to be provided through the new point will
be provided on an interruptible basis, and therefore, will have no impact on Columbia's existing design day and annual
obligations to its customers. In addition, Columbia states that the estimated cost to establish the new point of delivery
will be $15,778, which Gasco has agreed to reimburse Columbia for the total cost, plus any gross-up for tax purposes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DOE has, as a part of its mission, a goal to increase the number of science, engineering and mathematics professionals
that are available to perform its research and development mission and is authorized in the Energy Reorganization
Act of 1974 to ``*&blank;*&blank;* assure an adequate supply of manpower for the accomplishment of energy research
and development programs by sponsoring and assisting in education and training activities in postsecondary institutions,
vocational schools and other institutions *&blank;*&blank;*'' 42 U. S. C. 5813 (11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, DOE's concern is based on the consideration that the future supply of science and engineering manpower
is threatened by two factors: fewer students enrolling in science-based courses in high school and fewer students
available to join the science, engineering and math pool due to declining birth rates. Students who have completed
the ninth grade in high school often decide not to take another science-based course. Once the traditional math/science
sequence is disrupted, it is too late for students to meet the minimum requirements for admission to college and university
science and engineering programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of PREP is to alleviate manpower shortages in science, engineering and math careers by preparing
and guiding students entering sixth through tenth grades (have not completed the tenth grade) in the selection of
college-preparatory courses in science, mathematics and engineering. Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1),
eligibility for awards under this notice is limited to four-year accredited institutions of higher education which
grant baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics and engineering and to two-year institutions (community colleges).
Community colleges are encouraged to maintain articulation agreements with four-year institutions which offer
degrees in science, mathematics and engineering. Eligibility is restricted to these institutions because they
offer the science, mathematics and engineering degrees which the student participants entering sixth through tenth
grade will be encouraged to pursue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PREP projects are required to have a summer component and an academic year component. The summer component must be
no less than four continuous weeks, reaching a minimum of 24 students in grades six to ten (have not completed the tenth
grade). These 24 students must participate in the program for four continuous weeks. The academic year component
should provide enough time for meaningful followup. Typically, PREP grantee institutions work collaboratively
with local school districts, local industry, students' parents and peers to ensure success. If a previous PREP award
recipient, the applicant should describe the progress or results of work accomplished. Other elements which may
strengthen applications include, but are not limited to: interdisciplinary approach to teaching science and mathematics;
the use of role models and field trips; and students' active participation in hands-on activities. DOE financial
support is expected not to comprise the totality of funding for an individual project. In FY 1995, projects were supported
at 46 institutions. DOE funds of approximately $2 million were augmented by over $2.3 million in non-DOE (private
industry and university) funds and it is desirable that applications for the FY 1996 program indicate similar non-DOE
support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contingent upon availability of appropriated funds, DOE expects to make several two-year grants in FY 1996 to meet
the objectives of the program. The amount of each grant award will be limited to a maximum of $42,000 or $21,000 per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information about the development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, program requirements,
evaluation and selection processes, and other policies and procedures may be found in the ER Application Guide, and
10 CFR Part 605. The application kit and guide is available from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of University
and Science Education, ET&hyph;32, Washington, D.C. 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling (202) 586&hyph;8949.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number for this program is 81.049. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice requests further that the ``Detailed Description of Research Work Proposed'' component of a complete
grant application as established by 10 CFR 605 should not exceed 15 double-spaced, typed pages. This description
of work should include: (1) The conceptual design and how that design relates to program objectives; (2) the target
audience(s) the project will serve and efforts planned to serve that audience; (3) the mechanisms to be used to organize
and manage the project, including the roles and responsibilities, financial and otherwise, of any partnerships;
(4) the monitoring and evaluation plan, including how those plans can be used for possible modification; (5) the planned
outcomes and how these outcomes will be assessed and reported; and (6) the anticipated significance of the project
and how it will be confirmed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DOE is strongly committed to increasing the public's science literacy as well as increasing the number of students
interested in science and technology careers. Projects which are designed to enhance public awareness of, and to
encourage all young people to consider careers in, science and technology are strongly desired. While the application
must be submitted by a museum, collaborative efforts are encouraged. Such efforts by potential applicants may include:
Partnerships of several small museums, of a small and large museum, or of a history museum and youth museum in collaboration
with museum organizations; and cooperative enterprises which utilize the scientific and technical expertise of
the DOE laboratories, industry, and the broader educational community in conjunction with a museum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a part of DOE's effort to promote public science literacy; enhance the Nation's mathematics, science, and engineering
education; and fulfill the National Education Goal of ``by the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in the world in
science and mathematics achievements,'' eligibility for awards under this notice is restricted to U.S. museums
which will offer informal energy-related science education. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1), this restriction
is necessary to support established U.S. institutions which provide a valuable supplement to formal education and
will enhance meeting the national education goals. While this program anticipates awarding grants only from Fiscal
Year 1996 appropriations, the period of support of a grant may extend up to two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants are asked to submit a brief preapplication in accordance
with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2) and (3), which consists of no more than two pages of narrative describing the major project
objectives and method of accomplishment to be utilized by the applicant to determine the effectiveness of the intended
exhibit or media forum, collaborators, advisors, dissemination plan, work schedule, and approximate cost of the
project to DOE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the preapplication is to give the program staff the opportunity to determine the level and appropriateness
of interest in the project or activity. The program staff will also look at the approach the museum is considering.
Each museum will receive a written response to its preapplication. Once you have submitted a preapplication, however,
you may submit a formal application, regardless of the written response to the preapplication. Telephone and telefax
numbers are required to be part of the preapplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A formal application consists of an original and seven copies, a copy of the museum's Internal Revenue Service nonprofit
determination letter, and other documents as stated in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial
Assistance Program.

No electronic submissions (including fax) of preapplications or formal applications under this Program Notice
will be accepted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice requests further that the ``Detailed Description of Research Work Proposed'' component of a complete
grant application as established by 10 CFR Part 605 should not exceed 15 double-spaced, typed pages. This project
description should include: Conceptual design and how that design relates to the program objectives; description
of how the impact of the project will be maximized (dissemination); identification of the target audience(s) the
project will serve and efforts planned to serve that audience; identification of the mechanisms to be used to organize
and manage the project, including the rules and responsibilities, financial and otherwise, of any partnerships;
clarification of the monitoring and evaluation plan, including how those plans can be used for possible project modification;
delineation of the planned outcomes and how these outcomes will be assessed and reported; and discussion of the anticipated
significance of the project and how this will be confirmed. In addition, formal applications need to include information
that will provide the expected impact in terms of populations served and any evaluation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General information about development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluations
and selection processes, and other policies and procedures are contained in the Application Guide for the Office
of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR Part 605. Multiple applications are permissible; however,
each application must be limited to a single project. The DOE expects to make several grants in Fiscal Year 1996 to meet
the objectives of this program. It is anticipated that $1 million will be the total funds available in Fiscal Year 1996
subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Awards are expected to range from $10,000 to $200,000, with the
number of awards determined by the number of fundable applications and the total amount of funds available for this
program. The application guide is available from Billie L. Stooksbury and/or Marie Kitts, Oak Ridge Institute for
Science and Education, Science/Engineering Education Division/CP, P.O. Box 117, Oak Ridge, TN 37831&hyph;0117.

At this meeting, the primary activities of the EEC are (1) to review the Use Cluster Scoring System of the Office of Pollution
Prevention and Toxics; and (2) complete its plans for fiscal 1995. The proposed charge for the review is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are the methods used to define the chemical in a use cluster adequate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The main goal of the UCSS is to screen chemicals/clusters by using easily obtainable data to set priorities for OPPT.
Given the limited nature of this goal, are the data sources used in the UCSS appropriate? What additional data sources
could be used? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Are the data sources used in the UCSS appropriate to bin chemicals into high, medium, and low categories? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Are there other general areas/criteria (such as waste generation that should be included in the UCSS? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

those contributions were small and where the toxicity of the substances contributed is not significantly different
from the other agreement proposed to settle with parties who are each responsible for less than 00.60% of the total
volume of hazardous substances sent to the site. Settling 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PRPs will be required to pay their fair share of the past and estimated future response costs at the site. The settlement
payment amount includes three levels of premiums against estimated total response costs to account for potential
cost overruns, the potential for failure of the remedies selected to clean up the site, and other risks. The three levels
are 50% (for those Settling PRPs who are signatories to the 1991 Administrative Order on Consent for Remedial Investigation/Feasibility
Study at the MIG/Dewane Landfill), 100% (for those Settling PRPs who did not receive general or special notice of potential

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that a request for reissuance of an exemption to the land disposal restrictions under the 1984
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act has been granted to Albemarle
Corporation, for the Class I injection wells located at Magnolia, Arkansas. As required by 40 CFR part 148, the company
has adequately demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Environmental Protection Agency by petition and supporting
documentation that, to a reasonable degree of certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from
the injection zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous. This final decision allows the underground injection
by Albemarle Corporation of the specific restricted hazardous waste identified in the reissued petition, into the
Class I hazardous waste injection wells at the Magnolia, Arkansas facility specifically identified in the petition
for as long as the basis for granting an approval of this petition remains valid, under provisions of 40 CFR 148.24.
As required by 40 CFR 124.10, a public notice was issued on July 22, 1994. The public comment period ended on September
6, 1994. EPA received no comments. This decision constitutes final Agency action and there is no Administrative appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a new collection of information to support setting Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) in drinking water as
required under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Under SDWA section 1442 (a)(1)(D) the Administrator may conduct
research studies to explore ``improved methods...including improvements in water purification and distribution,
and methods of assessing the health related hazards of drinking water.'' The purpose of this study is to gather information
on the effects of water filtration on the presence of regulated (total coliform) and potentially regulated (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Giardia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cryptosporidium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and enteroviruses) microorganisms in drinking water; and to assess the level of disease associated with their presence
in drinking water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This voluntary collection of information consists of: (1) A feasibility study to determine the appropriateness
and willingness of utilities to participate in a large scale study, and subsequently; (2) a large scale environmental
health study to compare health data from selected households with corresponding water monitoring data from selected
water utilities prior to, and following, the installation of water filtration systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the feasibility study, questionnaires will be sent to a selected sample of water utilities and will request information
on characteristics of the drinking water delivery system, water quality monitoring data, and existence of historical
monitoring records. The questionnaire will also ask whether utilities will be willing to participate in the environmental
health study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the results of the feasibility study, three water utilities will be selected as sites for the environmental health
study. The study will focus on gathering information from selected households serviced by these sites over a nine
month period prior to, and following, the installation of drinking water filtration systems at these sites. An individual
from each participating household will: (1) Provide general demographic and underlying health condition information;
and (2) complete a monthly checklist indicating any respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms experienced during
the month for each household member.

 Municipal Water Pollution Prevention (MWPP) Program Evaluation (EPA No. 1728.01). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a new collection of information to support the self-auditing of municipal wastewater treatment facilities
under the EPA's MWPP program, as authorized under section 104 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). CWA section 104(b) (7),
as implemented through EPA's MWPP guidance (March 1991), authorizes EPA to develop effective and practical processes,
methods, and prototype devices for the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution. The MWPP self-audit
is needed to provide managers of municipal wastewater treatment facilities a framework with which to diagnose problems
and design actions to deal with them. This information collection applies to MWPP programs that are presently operated
by EPA Regions 6 and 10, and does not apply to State-delegated programs. These EPA Regions may choose to make the preparation
and submission of the self-audit to the EPA region mandatory under the authority of CWA section 308(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents conducting the MWPP self-audit may use the EPA self-audit form, or alternative methods, to provide information
documenting: (1) Actual, design, and potential influent flow and loadings, and number of overflows and bypasses;
(2) operator needs, training and certification practices; (3) biosolids treatment, storage and disposal capacity;
(4) facility age; (5) effluent quality versus permit limits; (6) new requirements (impact of changed water quality
standards); (7) financial status of the facility; (8) collection system information; and (9) other information
necessary to clarify responses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facility operators will prepare a corrective action plan and resolution that will be submitted with the self-audit
to facility owners (i.e. municipal governing bodies) for review and approval. Facility owners will then forward
the audit and relevant materials to the EPA Regional Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information may be used by facility owners/operators and local officials to assist in resource allocations and
encourage efficient use of existing facilities. EPA Regional Offices will use this information to target assistance
and develop priorities to better meet facility and municipality needs.

Burden Statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 26 hours for facility operators
and 2.5 hours for facility owners, for an estimated average of 28.5 hours per response including time for reviewing
questions, gathering the data needed, completing and reviewing the information, and submitting the information
to the EPA Region.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public Law 102&hyph;375 requires that the Policy Committee (which oversees the 1995 White House Conference on Aging)
formulate and approve a proposed agenda for the Conference and that this proposed agenda be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory language urges the 1995 White House Conference on Aging (WHCoA) to work jointly with States, individuals,
and public and private organizations to develop a proposed agenda which reflects the major issues facing older Americans
and their communities. The collection of public comments began immediately after President Clinton formally called
for the 1995 WHCoA in February 1994. Special emphasis has been placed on soliciting suggestions and ideas from a wide
range of sources_especially from the grassroots.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Input received from a variety of local, state, regional and national events conducted on behalf of the WHCoA over the
past several months points toward an agenda which goes beyond traditional boundaries and paints a broader picture
of aging_an agenda that looks at the present and the future. This Conference should examine a wide range of issues,
including the needs and contributions of today's and tomorrow's older citizens. This far-reaching examination
is evident in the broad support which has emerged for a theme and issues which incorporate the generational aspects
of aging. Congress also included the generational issue in the statute by mandating that the Conference look at the
interdependence of generations, the contributions of older individuals to societal well-being and the commonality
of problems facing both older and younger individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial suggestions from the grassroots for Conference themes and agenda issues have been used by the Policy Committee
to develop the proposed agenda for the 1995 WHCoA. Over 400 pre-conference events have been held around the country
to develop policy recommendations for building the agenda for the Conference.

As previously mentioned, comments are invited on the above list as well as on other issues and subissues which should
be addressed at the Conference. Public comment is also invited on a strategy for effectively linking issues and subissues
both for discussion and for developing recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that a large number of responses will be received from the public during the comment period. All comments
received will be reviewed and answered. The Policy Committee will establish priorities among the issues based on
public response to the proposed agenda. These prioritized issues will ultimately provide the foundation for the
final Conference agenda which will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Conference delegates will receive information about the final agenda in advance of the Conference to allow them
to prepare and actively participate in the 1995 WHCoA.

Part III. Post-Conference Action on Recommendations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the Conference, delegates will begin the process of establishing priorities for action among the recommendations
they produce. Immediately after the Conference, the Advisory Committee (appointed by the President), followed
by the Policy Committee, will be responsible for further developing the prioritized recommendations of the Conference
for inclusion in the proposed Conference report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed report will be submitted to each State Governor for review and comment as required by the Statute. After
reviewing the comments of the Governors, the Policy Committee will prepare and approve an initial report of the Conference
to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Policy Committee will also prepare a separate report on the necessary administrative and legislative actions
to implement the recommendations in the Conference report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final Conference report will serve as a catalyst as well as provide a blueprint for proposed post-WHCoA implementation
activities. This action-oriented blueprint will provide the framework for immediate and longer-term actions to
implement the Conference's highest priority recommendations. This blueprint will also identify areas and tasks
in which the public and private sectors, governmental and non-governmental organizations and agencies, can play
a role in implementing the Conference recommendations. These may include private initiatives as well as the enactment
of public policies and laws affecting aging Americans, their families and their communities now and into the 21st
century.

Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $2.0 million is projected to be available in FY 1995 to fund 6 to 9 grants. The amount of funding actually
available may vary and is subject to change. New grant awards will not exceed $300,000 per year (including both direct
and indirect costs). Grant applications that exceed the $300,000 per year cap will be returned to the investigator
as non-responsive. Research grant supplements will generally be no more than $75,000 (including both direct and
indirect costs). Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period not to exceed 3 years. Continuation
awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress demonstrated by investigators
at work-in-progress monitoring workshops, the achievement of workplan milestones reflected in the continuation
application, and the availability of Federal funds. In addition, if funds are available, continuation awards may
be eligible for increased funding to offset inflationary costs.

Programmatic Interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant applications for unintentional injury prevention and control research are sought. The focus of grants should
reflect the broad-based need to control injury morbidity, mortality, disability, and costs. Special consideration
may be given to applications requesting one or two years of funding. One-year pilot projects are encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In prevention, there is special programmatic interest in research which evaluates the effectiveness of interventions
in preventing injuries or reducing their impact and develops the basic sciences of injury (i.e., biomechanics and
epidemiology). This research might evaluate one or more different approaches to implementing a specific intervention
strategy for which there is already existing evidence of effectiveness (e.g., protective helmets for bicycle riders,
energy-absorbing playground surfaces, lowered tap water temperatures, etc.). In addition, there is a need to develop
new intervention strategies or examine intervention strategies for which evidence of effectiveness is either sparse
or totally lacking (e.g., public education and information campaigns, teaching infants to swim, interior design
innovations to prevent falls among older persons, etc.). Interventions chosen for evaluation should have a significant
potential for reduction in injury morbidity, mortality, disability, or cost. Special consideration will be given
to grant applications which target populations at high risk for injuries and their consequences, including adolescents,
children, racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, farm families, and people with low incomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In acute care, there is special programmatic interest in intensifying the role of the emergency department and in-patient
hospital trauma services in regard to public health surveillance and prevention of traumatic injuries. In acute
care settings, identifying underlying risk factors for injury and intervening to reduce or eliminate them can help
minimize the impact of violence, substance abuse, and other factors associated with injury recidivism. There is
also a need to assess the impact of national and State health care reforms on prehospital emergency medical services,
emergency department care of the injured, in-patient trauma care, and rehabilitation services. There is interest
in the identification of optimal methods for diagnosing and treating patients who have sustained major trauma, including
central nervous system injuries, burns, and multiple organ system injuries.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In rehabilitation, there is programmatic interest in clinical research and clinical trials on improved approaches
to comprehensive rehabilitation. This includes research directed towards minimizing the secondary complications
of injury including pressure sores, contracture, muscular atrophy, skeletal deformity and other definable conditions.
This research should cover methods of their prevention and take into account the injured person's need for education
to prevent recurrent medical problems and the role of the family in preventing secondary conditions. Population-based
and longitudinal studies are needed to better establish the prognoses and rehabilitation needs of patients with
traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, burns, and severe sensory loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In biomechanics, there is special programmatic interest in brain and spinal cord injury. This interest includes
the biomechanical evaluation of intervention concepts and strategies (e.g., bike helmets, energy absorbing playground
surfaces, hip pads, motor vehicle side impact and rollover countermeasures, etc.), development of models to elucidate
injury physiology and pharmacologic, surgical and other interventions; defining human tolerance limits for injury
among children, women, the chronically ill and older persons; improvements in injury assessment technology; and
understanding impact injury mechanisms and quantifying injury-related biomechanical responses for critical
areas of the human body (e.g., brain and vertebral injury with spinal cord involvement). Consideration will also
be given to the biomechanics of thoracic and abdominal viscera, musculature and joints including the articular cartilage,
tendons and ligaments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks
of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions. Also of interest is epidemiologic research having
as its focus the development of improved methods and the evaluation and improvement of injury surveillance systems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research is needed that more accurately defines the cost of unintentional injury and the cost effectiveness or prevention
effectiveness of interventions. Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an
intervention(s) pertinent to one of the topics previously outlined under prevention, acute care, rehabilitation,
biomechanics, etc. A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in, A Framework
for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,
March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR&hyph;3, pages 5&hyph;11). (To receive information on these reports see the section
Where to Obtain Additional Information.)

In some instances the Government may accept a lessee's royalty payment in oil rather than money. Title to this Royalty-In-Kind
(RIK) oil is transferred to the Government and then is sold to eligible refiners. When the Secretary of the Interior
determines that small refiners do not have access to adequate supplies of oil, the Secretary may dispose of RIK oil
by conducting a sale, or by allocating the oil to eligible refiners. Form MMS&hyph;4070, Application for the Purchase
of Royalty Oil, is submitted by refiners interested in purchasing oil. Information collected is used to determine
if the applicant meets eligibility requirements to purchase royalty oil.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Construction of the Trinity River Division of the CVP was completed in 1963. The keystones of the division are Lewiston
Dam and Trinity Dam located just upstream of the town of Lewiston, California. The primary function of the Trinity
River Division is to store Trinity River water for regulated diversion to the Central Valley of California for agricultural,
municipal, and industrial uses. A substantial amount of electric power is generated as water diverted out of the Trinity
River Basin passes through four hydroelectric power generation plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Construction of the Trinity River Division resulted in the diversion of up to 90 percent of the average annual discharge
in the Trinity River at Lewiston, and blocked access to 109 miles of spawning and rearing habitat to migrating salmon
and steelhead. The Trinity River Hatchery was constructed at the base of Lewiston Dam to mitigate for those fish production
losses that occurred upstream of Trinity Dam, and annual fishery flows of 120,000 acre-feet were released from Lewiston
Dam to maintain existing salmon and steelhead habitat downstream. These measures were insufficient to maintain
the fishery, however, and populations of salmon and steelhead declined at a rapid rate following completion of the
Trinity River Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduced river flows, combined with excessive watershed erosion and encroachment of the river channel by riparian
vegetation, caused major changes in the morphology of the Trinity River downstream of Lewiston Dam. Reduced flows
were no longer capable of transporting large amounts of sediment downstream. As a result, sand began to fill holding
pools, spawning riffles, and over-wintering and rearing areas with devastating effects on existing anadromous
salmonid habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1974, six State and Federal agencies formed the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Task force (Task Force) to
develop an action plan and seek funding for restoration of the fish and wildlife resources of the basin. In May 1982,
the Task Force completed a Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Management Program Report, which identified an action
plan consisting of 11 activities aimed at restoring fish and wildlife habitat. These activities included sediment
control and watershed stabilization, improvement of the Trinity River Hatchery, and habitat improvements in the
river and its tributaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to declining fisheries and degraded habitat conditions, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) decided
in 1981 to increase flows in the Trinity River from 120,000 acre-feet to 340,000 acre-feet annually, with reductions
in dry and critically dry years. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service was directed to undertake a 12-year Flow
Evaluation Study to assess fish habitat at various flows, develop a recommended flow regimen, and evaluate mainstem
channel restoration measures. The Flow Evaluation Study began in October 1984 and will conclude in September 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1984, the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (Public Law 98&hyph;541) was enacted by
Congress with the goal of restoring fish and wildlife populations to pre-CVP levels. The Act provided funding for
construction, operation, and maintenance of the 11-item action plan developed by the Task Force in 1982. The program
is administered by a field office staffed jointly by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service and
will end in 1995. The Act also identified a Task Force consisting of representatives from 14 Federal, State, and county
entities and the Hoopa Valley Tribe to assist and advise the Secretary. A 14-member Technical Coordinating Committee
has been established to assist and advise the Task Force and the field office. Modification of the mainstem channel
is a key element of the restoration program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3406(b)(23) of the CVPIA provides, through the Trinity River Division, an instream release of not less than
340,000 acre-feet of water to meet Federal trust responsibilities to protect fishery resources of the Hoopa Valley
Tribe and to meet the fishery restoration goals of Public Law 98&hyph;541.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Section 3406(b)(23)(A) of the CVPIA, of Public Law 102&hyph;575, recommendations for mainstem
Trinity River fishery restoration will be developed after appropriate consultations with Federal, State and local
agencies and after completion of an on-going Flow Evaluation Study. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to complete
the flow study and recommendations by September 30, 1996. The draft EIS/EIR is expected to be completed and available
for review and comment by the end of 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Hoopa Valley Tribe will seek public input on alternatives, concerns, and issues
to be addressed in the EIS through a series of scoping meetings. The schedule and locations of the scoping meetings
are as follows:

(SCBG) between milepost 121.0, at or near Santa Cruz, CA, and milepost 127.7, at or near Felton, CA, and (2) lease from
SCBG and operate a 2.1-mile connecting line segment between Felton and milepost 129.8, at or near Eccles, CA. The transaction
would enable EERX to interchange traffic with Southern Pacific Transportation Co. at or near Santa Cruz and was expected

 Under 49 CFR 1150.32(b), the exemption becomes effective 7 days after a complete verified notice is filed. Here, the
verified notice was tendered for filing without the appropriate filing fee. Because the verified notice was not complete,
and accepted for filing, until September 16, 1994, the exemption did not become effective, and the transaction could
not have been consummated, until September 23, 1994. 49 CFR 1104.7(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitions to reopen the proceeding under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to reopen
will not stay the exemption's effectiveness. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on Rick Hamman,

The Secretary of Labor has interpreted applicable sections of Federal laws to require States to have reasonable provisions
in their State unemployment insurance laws that concern the prevention, detection and recovery of benefit overpayments
caused by willful misrepresentation of errors by claimants or others. This report provides an accounting of the types
and amounts of such overpayment and serves as a useful management tool for monitoring overall unemployment insurance
program integrity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NSF's Antarctic Waste Regulation, 45 CFR Part 671, requires all U.S. citizens and entities to obtain a permit for the
use or release of a designated pollutant and for the release of waste in Antarctica. NSF has received a permit application
under this regulation which covers the waste management activities of a team of three to four individuals who will
be practicing minimum impact camping and mountaineering on the Antarctic Peninsula. The permit applicant is: Mr.
Bob McConnel, 1995 Antarctic Expedition, 128 S. Tejon, Suite 410, Colorado Springs, CO 80903.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Mr. McConnel's team is to test whether adventure travel can be conducted on the Antarctic Peninsula
in an environmentally sound fashion. The permit application is limited to the waste management activities of the
three to four team members and the release of emissions from helicopters used for surveying and transportation. The
proposed duration of the permit is from November 1, 1995 through March 30, 1996.

Activity for Which Permit Requested
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1995 Antarctic Expedition intends to spend approximately one month in Antarctica during the requested permit
term and establish approximately three base camps. Helicopters will be used to avoid landing by boat in areas with
concentrations of breeding penguins, seals, or birds. Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (SPAs) and Sites of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSIs) will be avoided. Food wastes and other garbage will be collected and removed from Antarctica.
Propane stoves will be used for cooking. Solid human waste will be packed out in a contained portable toilet system.
Conditions of the permit will include requirements to educate all participants with the requirements of the Antarctic
Conservation Act (ACA), report on the removal of materials and any accidental releases and manage human waste in accordance
with antarctic waste regulations.

Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;49, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensee), for operation of the Millstone
Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 3 located in New London County, Connecticut.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to allow a relaxation in setpoint tolerance of
the pressurizer safety valves (PSVs) and main steam safety valves (MSSVs) from plus or minus 1% to plus or minus 3%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, CT 06360. If a request for a hearing or petition for
leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by
the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition;
and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate
order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

<DOCTITLE>Commonwealth Edison Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;37, NPF&hyph;66, NPF&hyph;72, and NPF&hyph;77, issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd,
the licensee), for operation of the Byron Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Ogle County, Illinois and Braidwood Station,
Units 1 and 2, located in Will County, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter of August 13, 1993, and as supplemented on September 15, 1993, September 16, 1993, December 17, 1993, January
19, 1994, February 11, 1994, and February 24, 1994, ComEd submitted requests for amendments for steam generator (SG)
tube sleeving in accordance with (1) Westinghouse and (2) Babcock &amp; Wilcox processes. By letter dated March 4,
1994, the NRC granted the proposed sleeving methods contingent upon four conditions which the licensee accepted
in their letter of February 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the four changes will be reflected in the plants' Technical Specifications (TS). By letter dated June 3, 1994,
the licensee requested changes to TS 3.4.5 and 3.4.6.2 to include the three conditions, which are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect a primary-to-secondary leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per
day (gpd) through any one SG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect an inservice inspection of a minimum of 20 percent of a random sample
of the sleeves for axial and circumferential indication at the end-of-cycle. In the event that an imperfection of
40 percent or greater depth is detected, an additional 20 percent (minimum) of the unsampled sleeves should be inspected,
and if an imperfection of 40 percent or greater depth is detected in the second sample, all remaining sleeves should
be inspected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Add a condition to the Byron and Braidwood licenses to conduct additional corrosion testing to establish the design
life for the kinetically or laser welded sleeved tubes in the presence of a crevice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collectively, these conditions will enable the licensee to have:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Further assurance that the integrity of the SGs will be maintained in the event of a main steam line break or under
loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Increased monitoring of the SG tube sleeves for any degradation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Increased confidence that SG sleeve integrity will be maintained for extended operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original amendment requested [approval] of tubesheet sleeves and tube support plate sleeves as an alternate
tube repair method for Byron and Braidwood Units 1 and 2. The steam generator sleeves approved for installation use
the Westinghouse process (laser welded joints) and the Babcock and Wilcox (B&amp;W) process of kinetically welded
joints. The sleeve configuration was designed and analyzed in accordance with the criteria of Regulatory Guide (RG)
1.121 and the design requirements of Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. Fatigue
and stress analyses of the sleeved tube assemblies for both processes produced acceptable results as documented
in the Westinghouse and the B&amp;W topical reports submitted in the original sleeving package. Mechanical testing
has shown that the structural strength of the sleeves under normal, faulted, and upset conditions is within acceptable
limits. Leakage rate testing for the tube sleeves has demonstrated that primary-to-secondary leakage is not expected
during all plant conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any leakage through the sleeved region of the tube is fully bounded by the leak-before-break considerations and,
ultimately, the existing steam generator tube rupture analysis included in the Byron and Braidwood Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The reduction in TS leakage rate requirements from 500 gpd allowable per SG to 150
gpd further ensures that SG tube integrity is maintained in the event of a main steam line break (MSLB) or under Loss
Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) conditions. The RG 1.121 criteria for establishing operational leakage rate limits require
a plant shutdown based upon a leak-before-break consideration to detect a free span crack before a potential tube
rupture. The 150 gpd limit will continue to allow for early leakage detection and require a plant shutdown in the event
of the occurrence of an unexpected crack resulting in leakage that exceeds the revised Technical Specification limit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The sleeve sample size has been increased to a minimum of twenty (20) percent of the inservice sleeves. Increasing
the sample size of the sleeves to be inspected will increase the monitoring of tubes using sleeves for any further degradation
while they remain inservice. If the sample identifies a sleeve with an imperfection of greater [than] 40 percent depth,
an additional 20 percent of the sleeves shall be inspected. The sleeves that have identified imperfections of greater
than 40 percent shall be evaluated and removed from service. The inservice inspections and additional corrosion
testing for the sleeves and welded joints will continue until the corrosion resistance is demonstrated acceptable
to the NRC. If conformance with the acceptance criteria of section 4.4.5.4 for tube structural integrity is not confirmed,
the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. Increasing the monitoring of the sleeved
tubes will decrease the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of a corrosion testing program should determine the effects that material microstructure, chemistry,
and joint crevices will have on primary water stress corrosion cracking initiation and growth. This program will
not cause an increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated because the testing program
is conducted in laboratory conditions. If the results of the testing program do not confirm the structural integrity
of the tubes, the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. These changes do not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of the proposed amendment will not introduce significant or adverse changes to the plant design
basis. The proposed changes do not involve plant modification or changes to equipment, and consist of: reduction
in allowable steam generator leakage limits, increase in the sample size of the steam generator tube sleeved and the
addition of a commitment to perform a corrosion testing program on the sleeved tubes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduction in TS leakage rate requirements from 500 gpd allowable per SG to 150 gpd further ensures that SG tube integrity
is maintained in the event of a MSLB or under LOCA conditions. The 150 gpd limit is designed to provide for leakage detection
and a plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in excessive tube leakage.
The limit provides for early detection and a plant shutdown prior to a postulated crack reaching critical crack lengths
for Main Steam Line Break conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the sample size of tubes sleeved during each scheduled inservice inspection will increase the monitoring
of these tubes for any further degradation. The improved monitoring and evaluation of the tube and the sleeves assures
tube structural integrity is maintained or the tube is removed for service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, corrosion testing to establish sleeve design life and corrosion resistance to confirm tube structural
integrity will be performed. If the tube structural integrity is not confirmed, the tubes containing the sleeves
in question shall be removed from service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these actions the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated is
not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes will not reduce the margin of safety. This amendment involves the reduction
of steam generator leakage limit, and increase in the amount of sleeved tubes inspected and the incorporation of a
corrosion testing program for sleeved tubes. All of these actions will help ensure steam generator tube integrity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction of the leakage rate requirement from 500 to 150 gallons per day (gpd) per steam generator will continue to
ensure steam generator tube integrity is maintained in the event of main steam line break or under LOCA conditions.
The reduction to 150 gpd also limits the allowable primary-to-secondary leakage from 1 gallon per minute to 600 gpd
for all steam generators not isolated from the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). This previous leakage limit, used in
UFSAR accident analysis, ensured the dosage contribution from tube leakage would be limited to a small fraction of
the 10 CFR Part 100 dose guideline values in the event of either a steam generator tube rupture or steam line break. Reducing
these limits will not result [in] a reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The portions of the installed sleeve assembly which represent the reactor coolant pressure boundary can be monitored
for the initiation and progression of sleeve/tube wall degradation, thus satisfying the requirement of Regulatory
Guide 1.83. The portion of the tube bridged by the sleeve joints is effectively removed from the pressure boundary,
and the sleeve then forms the new pressure boundary. The sleeve enhances the safety of the plant by increasing the protective
boundaries of the steam generator. Keeping the tube in service with the use of a sleeve instead of plugging the tube
and removing it from service increases the heat transfer efficiency of the steam generator. Monitoring for any increased
degradation of a repaired steam generator tube shall be implemented at Byron and Braidwood by increasing the sampling
size of inservice sleeves to include an additional twenty (20) percent of the sleeves inservice. During each scheduled
in service inspection, each sampled sleeve evaluated and found to have unacceptable degradation shall be removed
from service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of a corrosion testing program should determine the effects that material microstructure, chemistry,
and joint crevices will have on primary water stress corrosion cracking initiation and growth. This program is conducted
in laboratory setting; therefore, [it] will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In addition,
the corrosion testing program will be performed to establish sleeve design life and corrosion resistance to confirm
tube structural integrity. If the tube structural integrity is not confirmed, the tubes containing the sleeves in
question shall be removed from service. These actions [do] not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the preceding analysis it is concluded that operation of Byron and Braidwood Units 1 and 2, in accordance with
the proposed amendment does not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated, does not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated, nor reduce any margins to plant safety. Therefore,
the license amendment does not involve a Significant Hazards Consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington
DC 20555 and at the local public document rooms which for Byron is located at the Byron Public Library, 109 N. Franklin,
Byron, Illinois 61010; and for Braidwood is located at the Wilmington Township Public Library, 201 S. Kankakee Street,
Wilmington, Illinois 60481. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 19, 1994,
through September 29, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49425).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment will move the current procedural details of the radiological effluent Technical Specifications
(TS) programmatic controls for radioactive effluents, radiological environmental monitoring and solid radioactive
wastes from the Administrative Controls Section of the TS to the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM) or the Process
Control Program (PCP), as appropriate, in accordance with the guidance of Generic Letter 89-01. This amendment will
also incorporate changes to the reporting requirements for the Effluent Release Reports, in accordance with 10 CFR
50.36; incorporate references to the new 10 CFR Part 20; and revise the terminology for the gaseous effluent release
rate limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transferring the procedural details from the TS to the ODCM and PCP and their replacement with programmatic controls
have no impact on plant operation or safety. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operation will
be altered as a result of this proposed change. The changes are unrelated to the initiation and mitigation of accidents
and equipment malfunctions addressed in the Final Safety Analysis Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the reporting requirements for Effluent Release Reports, the gaseous effluent release
rate limit and the relocation of the old 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302 have no impact on plant systems,
plant operations or accident precursors. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference
to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature. The change to the gaseous effluent release limit is also administrative
in nature in that it will allow the continued operation of the facility with the same release rate limits as are currently
implemented by the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transferring the procedural details from the TS to the ODCM and PCP and their replacement with programmatic controls
have no impact on plant operation or safety. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operation will
be altered as a result of this proposed change. No changes to plant components or structures are introduced which could
create new accidents or malfunctions not previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the reporting requirements for effluent Release Reports, the gaseous effluent release
rate limit and the relocation of the old 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302 have no impact on plant systems,
plant operations or accident precursors. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference
to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature. The change to the gaseous effluent release limits is also administrative
in nature in that it will allow the continued operation of the facility with the same release rate limits as are currently
implemented by the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedural details of the current RETS will be transferred to the ODCM and PCP and replaced with programmatic controls
consistent with regulatory requirements, including controls on revisions to the ODCM and PCP. Thus, no requirements
or controls will be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in
nature and therefore have no effect on the margin of safety. The proposed revisions to the gaseous effluent release
limits will maintain the release rate limits at the same level as currently implemented by the Technical Specifications.
Therefore, there will be no change in the types and amounts of effluents that will be released, nor will there be an increase
in individual or cumulative radiation exposures to any member of the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by reducing the frequency for testing the containment
spray system spray nozzles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of
any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relaxation of surveillance frequency will not affect any of the initiators or precursors of any accident previously
evaluated. Performance of CS spray nozzle testing on a ten year basis rather than on a five year basis will not increase
the likelihood that a transient initiating event will occur because transients are initiated by external events,
equipment malfunction, and/or catastrophic system failure. There are no failure mechanisms or modes for the CS system
or spray nozzles that could initiate a transient since the CS system is passive except during a Loss of Coolant Accident
(LOCA). Upon receipt of a Containment Spray signal (Containment High-High Pressure coincident with a Safety Injection
Signal), the CS pumps automatically start and valves align to provide spray flow through the CS risers, ring headers,
and out the spray nozzles. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves (the active components of the
system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test experience at Zion Station
supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis is adequate to detect degradation
or blockage of the spray nozzles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements
given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical
Specifications and will remove temporarily imposed Bases that are no longer applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the fact that reliability of the system will not be affected and transient precursors and initiators are not
affected by operation in accordance with the proposed changes, the probability of occurrence of accidents previously
evaluated will not significantly increase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change in surveillance frequency will not affect the ability of the CS system to function as designed
during the accidents considered in the Safety Analyses. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves
(the active components of the system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test
experience at Zion Station supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis
is adequate to detect degradation or blockage of the spray nozzles. Given the proposed changes, the CS system will
maintain the ability to reduce containment pressure, remove heat from containment, and remove iodine from the containment
atmosphere during the design basis LOCA. As a result, peak containment pressure will be maintained below design pressure
and the off-site release due to the postulated accident will remain as described in the Safety Analyses. Therefore,
based on the previous discussion, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not involve the addition of any new or different types of safety
related equipment, nor does it involve the operation of equipment required for safety operation of the facility in
a manner different from those addressed in the safety analyses. No safety related equipment or function will be altered
as a result of the proposed changes. Also, changes to the procedures governing normal plant operation and recovery
from an accident are not necessitated by the proposed Technical Specification changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements
given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical
Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no new failure modes or mechanisms are added by the proposed changes, the possibility or a new or different kind
of accident is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plant safety margins are established through LCOs, limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified
in the Technical Specifications. There will be no changes to either the physical design of the plant or to any of these
settings and limits as a result of relaxing the surveillance frequency of CS nozzle checks from five years to ten years.
Testing on a ten year basis is adequate to detect spray nozzle degradation or blockage since the system piping and spray
nozzles are constructed of corrosion resistant Type 304 stainless steel and since the system is normally passive
(i.e. spray risers and spray rings are empty with no flow except during an accident). This conclusion was also provided
in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05 which recommended revising the surveillance frequency as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements
given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical
Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, the ability to safely shut down the operating unit and mitigate the consequences of
all accidents previously evaluated will be maintained. Therefore, the margin of safety is not significantly affected.

Criterion 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The amendments will not affect either the probability or the consequences of an accident,
since no physical changes to the plant are being proposed. The amendments merely change the existing technical specification
settings for the above relays to more conservative values. Current field settings for these relays are already at
these more conservative values. No changes to the manner in which the plant is operated are being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, no actual changes to the physical plant are being proposed. No effect on plant operation
will occur, therefore the possibility of new accident types is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Criterion 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will
be unaffected, since no changes to the plant are being made. The proposed technical specification values are more
conservative and are intended to make the technical specifications correspond with the actual plant relay settings.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments would change the frequency for conducting the surveillance test required by TS 4.7.1.2.1 for the auxiliary
feedwater pumps from once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days and would add a footnote which clarifies that testing
is not required to be performed until system heatup has progressed to a pressure (600 psig) that will support conduct
of the test. The change in the surveillance frequency has been evaluated and approved by the NRC staff as discussed
in Section 9.1 of NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' The change
is based on the finding in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUREG-1366 that an analysis of AFW pump failures indicates that a monthly surveillance test interval may be contributing
to AFW pump unavailability through failures and equipment degradation and, therefore, AFW pump availability is
increased by quarterly testing on a staggered basis. Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specification
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' provided the sample TS
for this change. The change is accomplished by dividing TS 4.7.1.2.1a into two parts. The new 4.7.1.2.1a maintains
the previous 31-day testing frequency for the AFW valves while the new 4.7.1.2.1b inserts a new frequency of once per
92 days for the AFW pump tests. Also, an obsolete footnote is deleted. The new footnote discussed above is consistent
with NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Plants.'' Appropriate changes to the Bases
for the TS have also been proposed.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requested amendments decrease from monthly to quarterly the frequency at which the motor-driven and turbine-driven
AFW pumps must be demonstrated operable as specified in TS 4.7.1.2.1. They also incorporate a note of clarification
from the new Westinghouse STS into the existing Catawba specifications concerning when the pump head or discharge
pressure versus flow verification for the turbine-driven pump is required to be performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Criterion 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Decreasing the frequency of AFW pump testing as specified in TS from monthly to quarterly will
have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. Also,
since Catawba's AFW pump performance history supports making the proposed change, system response following an
accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result in increased accident
consequences. Deletion of the obsolete footnotes as indicated in the Catawba technical specification markups is
purely an administrative change, and therefore will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences of
any accident. Incorporating the new STS note will only serve to clarify when the turbine-driven pump is required to
be tested and will not have any impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. The pump will still
be tested as before and its acceptance criteria will be unaffected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. No new failure modes can be created
from an accident standpoint. The plant will not be operated in a different manner. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete
footnotes has no bearing on any accident initiating mechanisms. Incorporating the clarifying note from the new STS
will not result in any new acident sequences, since plant operation will be unaffected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will
be unaffected by the proposed changes. The AFW pumps will still be capable of fulfilling their required safety function,
since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. The availability of the AFW pumps will be increased
as a result of the proposed amendments because they will not have to be made unavailable for testing as frequently.
Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366 and Generic
Letter 93-05. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete footnotes will not result in any impact to plant safety margins. Incorporating
the note from the new STS will not impact any safety margins.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.2.2, ``Minimum Reactor Vessel Temperature
for Pressurization,'' and the associated Bases. Specifically, the proposed amendment replaces existing TS Figures
3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e and associated TS Tables 3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e, that define the limits for minimum reactor vessel
temperature for pressurization and account for neutron damage at exposures up to 18 effective full power years (EFPY),
with new figures and tables that are applicable for up to 18 EFPY. The licensee stated that the new pressure-temperature
(P-T) limits were developed based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant-specific Charpy shift model for Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 which is consistent with and meets
the requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, ``Radiation Embrittlement of Reactor Vessel Materials.''
The new P-T limits were calculated in accordance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, and with the requirements specified
in Appendix G to Section III of the American Society of Mechnical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 [NMP1], in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Components of the reactor primary coolant system are operated so that no substantial mechanical or thermal loading
is applied unless the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) materials are at a temperature well above the reference nil-ductility
temperature (RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the limiting RPV material. Protection against brittle fracture is further ensured by postulating a defect with
a depth 1/4 of the RPV wall thickness and a length 1-1/2 times the wall thickness, and calculating the allowable pressure
loading as a function of temperature using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Safety factors are applied to the allowable
loading determination and lower bound fracture toughness properties are used to represent the material behavior.
The net effect of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and the ASME Section III, Appendix G P-T curve calculative procedures
is to produce very conservative P-T curves. These procedures have been applied in the calculation of the proposed
P-T limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neutron damage during plant operation is accounted for in the allowable pressure loading by calculating an adjusted
reference nil-ductility temperature (ART
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, defines the ART
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the sum of the reference nil-ductility temperature (RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) plus the shift in the reference nil-ductility temperature caused by irradiation ([delta]RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), plus a margin. The proposed amendment replaces Equation (2) in Regulatory Position 2.1 with an accurate plant-specific
model. The ART
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 margin is the same as for earlier P-T curve calculations. Operation of NMP1 in accordance with the proposed P-T operating
limits will preclude brittle failure of the RPV materials. Safety margins for brittle fracture are in accordance
with those specified in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code. Therefore, the proposed
amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment incorporates P-T operating limits based on previously established calculative procedures
described in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code, and Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision
2. The proposed changes to the P-T operating limits are based on analyses of the irradiated limiting plate material
for Nine Mile Point Unit 1. The proposed changes do not modify any plant equipment nor do they create any potential initiating
events that would create any new or different kind of accident. Operation in accordance with the proposed P-T operating
limits will preclude brittle failure of the reactor vessel material, since safety margins specified in 10 CFR [Part]
50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code will be maintained. Therefore, the proposed P-T limits
will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation in accordance with the proposed P-T operating limits will preclude brittle failure of the reactor pressure

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 used in previous P-T curve calculations as a result of the more accurate representation of the Nine Mile Point Unit

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 is intended to be an accurate representation of the Charpy shift (indexed at 30 ft-lbs of absorbed energy) as a function
of fluence. Since the ASME Section III, Appendix G safety factors have been maintained and the Regulatory Guide 1.99,
Revision 2, margin term specified in Regulatory Position 2.1 has been applied in the same manner as in earlier P-T curve
calculations, no significant reduction in the margin of safety has resulted from the use of a plant-specific [delta]RT

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
(DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to change TS 3/4.1.2.5, ``Borated Water Sources - Shutdown,'' TS 3/4.1.2.6, ``Borated Water
Sources - Operating,'' and TS 3/4.5.5, ``Emergency Core Cooling Systems - Refueling Water Storage Tank.'' The changes
delete the minimum refueling water storage tank (RWST) solution temperature and increase the allowed outage time
(AOT) of the RWST for adjustment of boron concentration from 1 hour to 8 hours. Specifically, the minimum RWST temperature
requirement of TS 3.1.2.5b(3), TS 4.1.2.5b, and TS 4.5.5b would be deleted. TS 3/4.1.2.6 would be revised as follows:
(1) TS 3.1.2.6b, Action Statement b., and TS 4.1.2.6b, pertaining to the RWST, would be deleted. (2) Editorial changes
would be made to reflect the deletion of the RWST requirements. TS 3/4.5.5 would be revised as follows: the minimum
RWST temperature requirement of TS 3.5.5c would be deleted, and the action statement would be deleted and replaced
with two action statements. Action Statement a. would specify the requirements when the RWST is inoperable due to
boron concentration. The action statement would also provide 8 hours to restore the boron concentration to within
the required limits. If boron concentration is not restored within 8 hours, the action statement requires that the
unit be in hot standby within 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Action Statement b. would specify
the requirements when the RWST is inoperable due to reasons other than boron concentration. The associated Bases
would also be appropriately revised.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the RWST AOT does not alter the plant configuration or operation. The potential for the RWST boron concentration
to be outside the TS limits is small because the RWST and its contents are not involved with normal plant operation and
are not subject to process variations associated with plant operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential causes of boron concentration deviation have been evaluated with the conclusion that any deviation
in RWST boron concentration would not be expected to increase significantly during the proposed 7 hour AOT increase.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the RWST AOT from 1 hour to 8 hours for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not have
a significant effect on the accident analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change with no impact
on plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the minimum temperature limit for the RWST has no effect on the plant configuration or operation. The
removal of the temperature limits does not affect any accident analyses since evaluations have demonstrated that,
due to the moderate climate at DCPP, the RWST will not exceed the limits assumed in DCPP accident analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the RWST AOT from 1 hour to 8 hours for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not require
physical alteration to any plant system and does not change the method by which any safety-related system performs
its function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change that does
not affect the design and operation of the plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of the RWST temperature has no impact on any accident analysis due to the moderate climate at DCPP. Additionally,
the deletion of the temperature does not require any physical alteration to the plant or change the method by which
any safety-related system performs its function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the RWST AOT for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not affect any accident analysis
assumptions, initial conditions, or results. The margins of safety reflected in the DCPP TS are not compromised by
the 7 hour AOT increase. Consequently, the proposed change does not have an effect on margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change that does
not affect the requirements for the RWST nor alter its function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the RWST temperature limits will not affect the assumptions of any accident analysis because the moderate
climate at DCPP will prevent the temperature assumptions in the analyses from being exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to relocate TS 3/4.4.2.1, ``Safety Valves - Shutdown,'' 3/4.4.7, ``Chemistry,'' 3/4.4.9.2, ``Pressurizer
(Temperature Limits),'' 3/4.4.10, ``Structural Integrity,'' and 3/4.4.11, ``Reactor Vessel Head Vents,'' in
accordance with the Commission's Final Policy Statement for relocation of current TS that do not satisfy any of the
screening criteria for retention. As part of the relocation of TS 3/4.4.2.1, TS 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety Valves - Operating,''
would be revised to require that the pressurizer safety valves be operable in Mode 4 with the reactor coolant system
cold-leg temperature greater than the low-temperature overpressure protection system enable temperature, and
TS 6.8, ``Procedures and Programs,'' would be revised to include the reactor coolant pump flywheel inspection program.
The specific TS changes proposed are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.4.2.1 ``Safety Valves - Shutdown,'' 3/4.4.7, ``Chemistry,'' 3/4.4.9.2,
``Pressurizer (Temperature Limits),'' 3/4.4.10, ``Structural Integrity,'' 3/4.4.11, ``Reactor Vessel Head
Vents,'' and TS 6.8, ``Procedures and Programs,'' would be revised in accordance with the Commission's Final Policy
Statement on TS Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)TS 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety Valves - Operating,'' would be revised to require that the pressurizer safety valves be
operable in Mode 4 with the reactor coolant system cold-leg temperature greater than the low- temperature overpressure

a. Do the changes involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes simplify the TS, meet regulatory requirements for relocated TS, and implement the recommendations
of the Commission's Final Policy Statement on TS Improvements. Future changes to these requirements will be controlled
by 10 CFR 50.59. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any modifications to any plant
equipment or affect plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Do the changes create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature, do not involve any physical alterations to any plant equipment,
and cause no change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes do not alter the basic regulatory requirements and do not affect any safety analyses. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
(DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to change TS 3/4.4.9.1, ``Reactor Coolant System - Pressure/Temperature Limits,'' Figures
3.4-2, ``Reactor Coolant System Heatup Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' and 3.4-3, ``Reactor Coolant System
Cooldown Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' to extend the applicability up to 12 effective full-power years
(EFPYs). TS 3/4.4.9.3, ``Overpressure Protection Systems,'' would be revised to specify a new low-temperature
overprotection (LTOP) system actuation pressure setpoint. The associated Bases would also be appropriately revised.
Additionally, TS 3/4.1.2.2, ``Flow Paths - Operating,'' TS 3/4.1.2.4, ``Charging Pumps - Operating,'' TS 3/4.4.1.3,
``Hot Shutdown,'' TS 3/4.4.1.4.1, ``Cold Shutdown - Loops Filled,'' TS 3/4.4.9.3, and TS 3/4.5.3, ``Tavg Less than
350 Degrees F,'' would be revised to specify a new LTOP system enable temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In TS 3/4.4.9.1, Figure 3.4-2, ``Reactor Coolant System Heatup Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' and Figure
3.4-3, ``Reactor Coolant System Cooldown Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' are revised as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The ``Controlling Materials'' for the pressure/temperature curves are revised to reflect the current reactor
vessel beltline region limiting weld and plate materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)The title for the figures is changed to reflect the applicability of the pressure/temperature curves for up to
12 EFPYs of service life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed changes to TS 3/4.4.9.3 are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The LTOP enable temperature would be changed from 323
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 270
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to be consistent with Branch Technical Position (BTP) RSB 5-2, Revision 1, Branch Position B.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) LTOP system actuation pressure setpoint would be revised from less than or equal to 450 psig to less than or equal
to 435 psig.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) TS 3/4.1.2.2, TS 3/4.1.2.4, TS 3/4.4.1.3, TS 3/4.4.1.4.1, TS 3/4.4.9.3, and TS 3/4.5.3 would be revised to change
the LTOP enable temperature from 323
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 270
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to be consistent with BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1, Branch Position B.2. TS Bases 3/4.4.9.1 would be revised to delete
a reference to Table 4.4-5, ``Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program - Withdrawal Schedule.'' The table was
deleted from the TS in Amendments 54 and 53 issued in July 1990. Reference to the table in Bases 3/4.4.9 was inadvertently
not deleted. The information in this table is currently contained in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) Update.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) TS Bases 3/4.4.9.3 would be revised to discuss limitations on reactor coolant pump (RCP) and emergency core cooling
system/chemical and volume control system pump operation during low reactor coolant system (RCS) temperature conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The other affected TS Bases would also be revised.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Figures 3.4-2 and 3.4-3 of TS 3.4.9.1 and the associated Bases will extend the applicability
of the RCS heatup and cooldown pressure/temperature limits from 8 to 12 EFPY. Since the level of reactor vessel embrittlement
projected for 12 EFPY is bounded by that previously projected for 8 EFPY, the proposed changes will not impact the probability
of brittle fracture of the vessel, and consequently not impact the consequences of an accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present LTOP pressure setpoint was reviewed and found to be acceptable and conservative for the extension of the
pressure/temperature curves to 12 EFPY. However, as a result of issues unrelated to the change in the applicability
of the pressure/temperature curves, the LTOP actuation pressure setpoint is reduced. The change accounts for pressure
measurement error identified in NRC IN [Information Notice] 93-58, a time delay in the LTOP system actuation introduced
as part of the installation of the Eagle 21 protection system, and additional conservatism incorporated into the
DCPP LTOP analysis. The changes to the pressure setpoint are conservative and provide assurance that the maximum
cold RCS pressure will not be exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3 will revise the LTOP enable temperature
to be consistent with the methodology and definition of ``low temperature'' provided in BTP RSB 5-2 Revision 1. The
proposed changes do not involve physical alteration of the LTOP system or change the method by which the LTOP system
performs its function. The proposed changes will benefit DCPP by expanding the RCS pressure/temperature window,
thereby increasing operator flexibility during heatup and cooldown. This will decrease the probability of an accident
by decreasing the likelihood of an inadvertent PORV [power-operated relief valve] actuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is administrative in nature and does not affect plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to TS 3.4.9.1 do not involve any physical alteration to any plant system or change the method by
which any safety-related system performs its function. The probability of catastrophic failure of the reactor vessel
will not be changed as a result of the extension of the curves to 12 EFPY. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present LTOP pressure setpoint was reviewed and found to be acceptable and conservative for the extension of the
pressure/temperature curves to 12 EFPY. However, as a result of issues unrelated to the change in the applicability
of the pressure/temperature curves, the LTOP actuation pressure setpoint is reduced. The change accounts for pressure
measurement error identified in IN 93-58, a time delay in the LTOP system actuation introduced as part of the installation
of the Eagle 21 protection system, and additional conservatism incorporated into the DCPP LTOP analysis. The changes
to the pressure setpoint are conservative and provide assurance that the maximum cold RCS pressure will not be exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3 will revise the LTOP enable temperature
to be consistent with the methodology and definitions provided in BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1. Additionally, the proposed
changes will not affect the ability of the LTOP system to provide pressure relief at low temperatures, thereby maintaining
the LTOP design basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is administrative in nature and does not result in physical
alterations or changes to the operation of the plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to TS 3.4.9.1 will extend the applicability of the RCS heatup and cooldown pressure/temperature
limits to 12 EFPY, but will not physically change these limits. The pressure/temperature limits have been determined
in accordance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix G, and include the safety margins with regard to brittle fracture required by
the ASME Code, Section III, Appendix G. The RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
ndt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
s determined for the reactor vessels at 12 EFPY are lower than the values previously determined at 8 EFPY. Therefore,
there will be additional safety margin in the pressure/temperature limits with respect to Appendix G requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in the LTOP pressure setpoint is conservative and provides assurance that the current margin of safety
is maintained. The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3, will revise the
LTOP enable temperature to be consistent with the methodology and definitions provided in BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1,
which provides the requirements for reactor vessel overpressurization protection at low temperatures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is an administrative change and does not involve any physical
alteration to the plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would revise the Limiting Condition for Operation for the Emergency Core Cooling System specified
in Technical Specifications Section 3.5.1 and associated Bases Section 3.4.5.1 to include a new ACTION statement
in the event that the High Pressure Coolant Injection system and one Core Spray subsystem, and/or one Low Pressure
Coolant Injection subsystem, are inoperable.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change does not involve any physical changes to plant systems or components, nor does it affect the
ability of the Low pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Core Spray (CS), and High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI)
systems to respond to an accident. These systems are not accident initiators, since their design function is accident
mitigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed TS change, which only addresses equipment status, will not significantly increase the probability
of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated. The addition of the proposed ACTION statement enables the plant
not to implement TS Section 3.0.3, which requires a plant shutdown, when the HPCI system is inoperable in conjunction
with one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. The proposed TS change does not impact the operation of any
equipment important to safety. This proposed TS change does not make physical modifications to the plant or to equipment,
nor does it impact any design requirements of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. The proposed TS change does not introduce
any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated, since no physical changes are being made
to the facility. This proposed change will not create any new failure modes which would cause plant equipment to malfunction
more frequently than previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for TS Sections 3.8.2.1 and 3.8.3.1, which specify that four (4) independent divisions of Safeguard dc electrical
power shall be operable, or shall be restored to operability with 8 hours, is to ensure that sufficient power is available
to supply safety-related equipment required to safely shut down the plant, and to provide for mitigation and control
of accident conditions at the plant. As discussed in Section 6.3.2 of the NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER), i.e.,
NUREG-0991, ``Safety Evaluation Report Related to the Operation of Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2,''
dated August 1983, the most limiting single failure for the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), which includes
all break sizes, is the failure of the dc power system common to the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and one (1) LPCI
subsystem. Only one (1) single failure is assumed to occur in the event of a Design Basis Accident (DBA). Therefore,
three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the Automatic Depressurization (ADS) system would be operable and
available, for use in the event of a DBA, to provide sufficient core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although
the loss of Division 2 dc power specifically impacts the ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER
evaluates the number of ECCS available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of
which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS.
Therefore, the loss of the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is bounded by the existing
analysis. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is an analyzed condition, and
actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3 are related to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3
are not applicable to this scenario. Adding an ACTION statement, as proposed, identical to the ACTION statement which
currently applies to the loss of Division 2 of Safeguard dc electrical power causes no change in the consequences of
any accidents previously evaluated. This proposed TS change does not impact systems, structures, and components
designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In the event of an accident, the plant configuration following
the event will be within the bounds of the existing analysis, and there will be no change in the radiological consequences
due to an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident [previously]
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change does not require any physical changes to plant systems or equipment, nor will it affect the ability
of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems from performing their design functions, which is to mitigate the consequences of
an accident. These systems do not contribute to the initiation of an accident, since their function is accident mitigation.
This proposed TS change will not introduce new equipment malfunction or failure modes. The proposed TS change will
not introduce any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated. The existing design basis
for the plant, as described in Section 6.3.2.5 of the LGS Updated Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and Section 6.3.2
of the NRC SER, bounds the condition proposed by this TS Change Request. Section 6.3.2 of the NRC SER indicates that
the most limiting single failure for the ECCS is the loss of the dc system powering the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. Assuming
this failure, three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the ADS would still be operable and available, for use
in the event of a DBA, to ensure adequate core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although the loss of Division 2 dc
power specifically affects ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER evaluates the number of ECCS
available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed
to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS
subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem, is an analyzed condition, and the actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3
pertain to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3 do not apply to the condition proposed by this
TS Change Request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change [TS] does not involve any physical changes to the design or functional requirements of the LPCI,
CS, or HPCI systems. These systems will continue to function as designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed TS change involves adding an additional ACTION statement, and revising the associated supporting
Bases section, to specifically address the inoperability of the HPCI system in conjunction with the inoperability
of one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. These systems would be inoperable in the event of the loss of
Division 2 of the Safeguard dc electrical power supply. The Bases associated with Safeguard electrical power systems,
which provide power to equipment required to safely shutdown the plant and to mitigate consequences of an accident,
are unchanged. The proposed TS change involves adding an ACTION statement which is identical to the ACTION statement
which addresses the inoperability of Division 2 of Safeguard dc power, which is a condition analyzed in the LGS UFSAR
and NRC SER. Therefore, the proposed TS change to include an additional ACTION statement does not involve a reduction
in a margin of safety.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the
LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed change to TS does not affect the requirement to perform
surveillance testing and the manner of performing surveillance testing is adequately described in plant procedures.
The UFSAR containing the Battery Load Cycle Table and station procedures are maintained using the provisions of 10
CFR 50.59 and are subject to the change control process in the Administrative Controls Section of the LGS TS Section
6.0. Since any future changes to these controlled documents will be evaluated per 10 CFR 50.59, no [changes] (significant
or insignificant) in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will be allowed. Therefore,
this change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the
LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). This change will not alter the plant configuration (no new or different
type of equipment will be installed) or make changes to methods governing normal plant operations. This change will
not impose different requirements and adequate control of information will be maintained. The manner of performing
surveillance testing can be adequately described in plant procedures. The proposed change will remove the table,
and will not alter assumptions made in the safety analysis and licensing basis. Therefore, this change will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the
LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The change will not reduce the margin of safety since the location
of the Battery Table has no impact on any safety analysis assumptions. Since all Battery Load Table changes (i.e.,
UFSAR Changes) and procedure changes are evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, no reduction (significant
or insignificant) in the margin of safety will be allowed. Therefore, this change will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing requirements for NRC review and approval of revisions, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.90, to those details
and requirements proposed for deletion, do not have a specific margin of safety upon which to evaluate. However, since
the proposed change is consistent with the BWR Standard Technical Specifications (NUREG-1433), revising the TS
to reflect the approved level of detail and requirements ensures no reduction in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment incorporates line item Technical Specification improvements listed in Generic Letter 93-05
relevant to Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) surveillance requirements. The proposed amendment eliminates the
requirements to start EDGs with an inoperable offsite circuit(s) of AC electrical power and adds a provision that
eliminates required testing of the remaining EDGs when one EDG is inoperable due to an inoperable support system or
an independently testable component with no potential for common mode failure for the remaining EDGs. In addition,
if testing of the EDGs is required, then the surveillances will be performed within 16 hours instead of 24 hours as currently
specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment also deletes the requirement to perform a loss of offsite power (LOP) test following the 24-hour
EDG endurance run test. In its place, a hot restart test (no LOP load sequencing) will be established.

LCR 94-10
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes in this License Change Request (LCR) have been extensively reviewed by the NRC during the preparation
of NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05, and by [Public Service Electric and Gas Company] PSE&amp;G during the development
and approval of this LCR. The LCR revises the current ACTION statement of Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 to eliminate
testing of the unaffected Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) upon loss of an offsite power circuit(s) and/or an EDG.
The basis for this testing was originally to verify the reliability of the EDGs, however, as stated in NUREG-1366,
industry experience has shown that excessive testing of the EDGs has in fact reduced reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EDG design and function remain as previously analyzed and the EDG response during accident conditions is not affected.
This change will improve EDG performance by reducing the number of unnecessary starts and by requiring more appropriate
testing (within 16 hours instead of 24 hours) when there is a potential common mode failure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident, nor will it result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LCR 94-13
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes in this License Change Request (LCR) have been extensively reviewed by the NRC during the preparation
of NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05, and by PSE&amp;G during the development and approval of this LCR. Regulatory
Guide 1.108, Rev. 1, states that the performance of a loss of Off-site Power (LOP) test (Surveillance Requirement
4.8.1.1.2.h.4.b) immediately following the 24 hour endurance run demonstrates that the Emergency Diesel Generator
(EDG) can start in the prescribed time when the EDG is at its normal operating temperature. The purpose of performing
the LOP test immediately following the 24 hour endurance run is to demonstrate the hot restart capability of the EDG
at full load conditions. However, demonstrating diesel generator hot restart capability without loading the engine
does not invalidate or reduce the effectiveness of the hot restart test. Performance of this test can be conducted
in any plant condition since its performance at power will have no adverse effect on plant operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LOP test will continue to be performed at standby conditions to provide assurance that the EDG is capable of responding
to a LOP as assumed in the accident analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EDG design and function remain as previously analyzed. Their response during accident conditions [is] not affected
by these changes. Therefore, no significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated results
from these changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LCR 94-10
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of the unnecessary EDG starts will not result in any change in plant configuration or operation. Therefore,
the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated or analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LCR 94-13
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the Technical Specifications do not involve a physical change in any system configuration
and do not introduce new operating configurations. These changes will not result in any net reduction in testing and
will not affect EDG reliability. This test may be performed in any plant condition since its performance at power will
have no adverse effect on plant operations. Therefore, these changes do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LCR 94-10
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes proposed in this LCR do not reduce the ability of any system or component to perform its safety related function.
The basis of NUREG-1366, Generic Letter 93-05 and the analysis performed in support of this LCR is that the reduction
in unnecessary EDG starts can improve safety by diminishing challenges to plant systems and reducing equipment wear
or degradation. These proposed changes involve only surveillance frequencies and do not change the method of performing
any surveillance. The operation of systems and equipment remains unchanged. Therefore, eliminating unnecessary
EDG starts does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LCR 94-13
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveillance testing per the proposed Technical Specifications would continue to demonstrate the ability of the
EDGs to perform their intended function of providing electrical power to the emergency safety systems needed to mitigate
design basis transients consistent with the plant safety analyses. The margin of safety demonstrated by the plant
safety analyses is therefore not affected by the proposed changes.

basis analysis, and therefore the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not increased.
The change, as described in section IB, [the addition of the new action statement] incorporates into the applicable
LCO the action statement which is already taken under technical specification 3.0.3, and does not alter the operator
response or response time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As stated in response to question number 1 above, the change does not change any assumption or parameter assumed to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would modify the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1, (VCSNS) Technical Specifications
(TS) to allow alternative, equivalent testing of diesel fuel used in the emergency diesel generators (EDG). These
alternative methods are necessary due to recent changes in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulations that
are designed to limit the use of high sulfur fuels. The licensee also proposes to modify the VCSNS TS by changing the
revision level of WCAP-10216-P-A, ``Relaxation of Constant Axial Offset Control - FQ Surveillance Technical Specification,''
referenced in TS 6.9.1.11. This pertains to the FQ(z) TS (TS 3.2.1 and 3.2.2) and is necessary since Westinghouse revised
their methodology in determining FQ(z).

1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil has no impact on the probability or consequences of any design basis
accident. These tests have been determined to be equivalent to the previously approved testing methods and are needed
due to changes in the EPA's regulations regarding sulfur in motor vehicle fuels. The dye used to identify high sulfur
fuels will have no adverse affect on the performance of the EDG's. The proposed testing assures a continued high level
of quality of the diesel fuel received and stored on site.

The change in revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 has no impact on the probability of occurrence or

to plant equipment or procedures which could affect any operational modes or accident precursors. This change only
incorporates by reference, the methodology for determining the penalty to be used in calculating Core Operating
Limits. This methodology allows the penalty to be cycle specific and is primarily affected by the core configuration.
This penalty is used for normal operation and provides more conservatism to the core operation for the cycle.

The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated. These tests have been determined by the EPA and other organizations to be
equivalent to the previously approved testing methods. The effect of the blue dye, used to identify high sulfur fuels,
on the performance of the EDGs has been evaluated and determined to be insignificant. The testing proposed assures

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The
proposed testing methods have been determined to be equivalent to the previously approved testing methods. The test
for sulfur assures that the sulfur content is within the allowable range for weight-percent. The test for color and
clarity assures that the fuel is relatively free of water and particulate contaminants. The proposed tests provide
at least an equivalent level of quality and repeatability for the fuel oil analysis, thus assuring that the margin
of safety is not reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 does not change the proposed reload design or safety
analysis limits for each cycle reload core. The associated change to WCAP-10216-P-A due to the revision will be specifically
evaluated using approved reload design methods. The larger penalty actually provides for an increase in margin during
certain burnup ranges. Since the safety analysis limits are unaffected, and the cycle specific analysis will show
that the analysis limits are met, the change proposed will have no adverse impact on a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: No
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) in Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.9.8.1 and 3.9.8.2 define the operability
requirements for the Shutdown Cooling (SDC) system during refueling operations (Mode 6) while the water level above
the top of the reactor vessel flange is at least 23 feet and less than 23 feet, respectively. The objective of these TSs
is to ensure that (1) sufficient cooling is available to remove decay heat, (2) the water in the reactor vessel is maintained
below 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and (3) sufficient coolant circulation is maintained in the reactor core to minimize
boron stratification leading to a boron dilution incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes affect the current limits imposed while ensuring adherence to the basis of the TS. No plant
modifications are being made. The reactor cavity water level limitations and SDC system required operating times
are being changed based on plant specific calculations and the objectives of the TSs are being maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) reduce the water level where two trains of SDC are required from 23 feet to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel
flange, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Bases Section 3/4.9.8, it is stated that ``With the reactor vessel head removed and 23 feet of water above the
reactor pressure vessel flange, a large heat sink is available for core cooling, thus in the event of a failure of the
operating shutdown cooling train, adequate time is provided to initiate emergency procedures to cool the core.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Bases for the New Standard Technical Specifications, ``NUREG 1432, Revision 0, dated September 30, 1992, Section
B 3.9.4 it is stated that; ``The 23 ft level was selected because it corresponds to the 23 ft requirement established
for fuel movement in LCO 3.9.6, ``Refueling Water Level.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern California Edison (Edison) calculations show that there is a minimal difference in the time to boil due to
the 3-foot change in required water level. Therefore, adequate water is still available to mitigate the consequences
of losing SDC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) increase the time a required train of the SDC system may be removed from service from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period
to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) allow the SDC system to be removed from service to allow testing of Low Pressure Safety Injection system components,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes the time the SDC train may be removed from operation from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to
2 hours per 8-hour period, and allows removal of the SDC train from operation for testing of the Low Pressure Safety
Injection (LPSI) system components as well as for core alterations in the vicinity of the hot legs. The proposed TS
change also imposes certain restrictions to ensure operating the SDC system in accordance with this proposed TS change
is of no safety significance. These restrictions are discussed separately below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When securing the only operating train of the SDC system, the maximum Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature is
maintained less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The initial conditions and heatup rate are selected such
that the RCS temperature remains less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit during the test. Therefore, there is
ample margin to boiling. Typical initial temperatures are less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The water being injected by the LPSI system test is cool water from the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) and will
increase the available inventory providing the heat sink by several inches. The two hours is sufficient time to align
the system to test, perform the test, and restore the train of SDC to operation prior to exceeding 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No operations are permitted that would cause a reduction of the RCS boron concentration. This minimizes the probability
of an inadvertent boron dilution event. The use of adequately borated water for injection into the RCS during the test
provides assurance that the test itself cannot lead to a boron dilution event. When the SDC system is operating, the
minimum SDC flow rate of 2200 gpm imposed by TS 4.9.8.1 and TS 4.9.8.2 is sufficient to ensure complete mixing of the
boron within the RCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LPSI component testing is only allowed when the reactor cavity water level is maintained greater than or equal
to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange. This level ensures an adequate heat sink to perform the LPSI pump
suction header check valve test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20
feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange
when the specified requirements are not met,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of a loss of SDC, the time to boil is reduced from approximately 3.7 hours when the water level is 23 feet above
the reactor vessel flange to approximately 2.3 hours at 12 feet, assuming the reactor has only been shutdown for 6 days.
However, this is ample time to close containment (less than 1 hour) and to restore SDC or initiate alternative cooling
(e.g., add water to the cavity (approximately 1 hour)). Twelve feet of water above the reactor vessel flange corresponds
to 24 feet 8-7/8 inches above the active fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring the reactor to be shutdown for at least 6 days to have only one train of SDC operable when the reactor cavity
level is between 20 feet and 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures that the time to boil is greater
than twice the time it would take us to establish containment closure and to commence reactor cavity fill with the required
standby equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One train of SDC operating with a containment spray pump allows for the high capacity LPSI pump to be the main standby
pump capable of filling the reactor cavity to at least 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange upon loss of
SDC. The high pressure safety injection pump will also be maintained ready to increase the water level if needed. In
support of this contingency the RWST will be required to contain the volume of water required to raise the level to 20
feet above the reactor vessel flange.... The reactor cavity can be filled at a rate of approximately 4.0 inches per
minute with the LPSI pump.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If operating one train of the SDC system with less than 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange and
any of the required conditions are not met, requiring immediate action to establish greater than or equal to 20 feet
of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures no time is wasted trying to restore conditions that should
be used to increase the volume of water of the heat sink. By taking action to restore the level to 20 feet above the reactor
pressure vessel flange the plant will be placed in TS 3.9.8.1, which only requires one train of SDC to be operable. Additionally,
the core will not heat up while the water level in the reactor cavity is being raised with cool water from the RWST. This
will provide additional time to either restore the one train of SDC or take other actions to provide core cooling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), with (a) one train of the SDC system operable with the reactor cavity water
level greater than or equal to 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, and (b) one train of the SDC system operable
with the reactor cavity water level greater than or equal to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, showed
that the operations in accordance with the proposed TS would not significantly increase the probabilities of inventory
boiling and core damage.

as well as for core alterations in the vicinity of the hot legs. The proposed TS change also imposes certain restrictions
to ensure operating the SDC system in accordance with this proposed TS change is of no safety significance. These restrictions

When securing the only operating train of the SDC system, the maximum RCS temperature is maintained less than or equal

No operations are permitted that would cause a reduction of the RCS boron concentration. This minimizes the probability
of an inadvertent boron dilution event. The use of adequately borated water for injection into the RCS during the test
provides assurance that the test itself cannot lead to a boron dilution event. When the SDC system is operating, the
minimum SDC flow rate of 2200 gpm is sufficient to ensure complete mixing of the boron within the RCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LPSI component testing is only allowed when the reactor cavity water level is maintained greater than or equal
to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange. This level ensures an adequate heat sink to perform the LPSI pump
suction header check valve test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The added requirements and the nature of the test provide assurances that the water temperature will be maintained
less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit and that boron stratification is prevented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20
feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange
when the specified requirements are not met,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of a loss of SDC, the time to boil is reduced from approximately 3.7 hours at 23 feet to approximately 2.3
hours at 12 feet, when the reactor has only been shutdown for 6 days. However, this is ample time to close containment
(less than 1 hour), and to restore SDC or initiate alternative cooling (e.g., add water to the cavity (approximately
1 hour)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring the reactor to be shutdown for at least 6 days to have only one train of SDC operable when the reactor cavity
level is between 20 feet and 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures that the time to boil is greater
than twice the time it would take us to establish containment closure and to commence reactor cavity fill with the required
standby equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One train of SDC operating with a containment spray pump allows for the high capacity LPSI pump to be the main standby
pump capable of filling the reactor cavity to at least 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange upon loss of
SDC. The high pressure safety injection pump will also be maintained ready to increase the water level if needed. In
support of this contingency the RWST will be required to contain the volume of water required to raise the level to 20
feet above the reactor vessel flange. The reactor cavity can be filled at a rate of approximately 4.0 inches per minute
with the LPSI pump.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If operating one train of the SDC system with less than 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange and
any of the required conditions are not met, requiring immediate action to establish greater than or equal to 20 feet
of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures no time is wasted trying to restore conditions that should
be used to increase the volume of water of the heat sink. By taking action to restore the level to 20 feet above the reactor
pressure vessel flange the plant will be placed in TS 3.9.8.1, which only requires one train of SDC to be operable. Additionally,
the core will not heat up while the reactor cavity water level is being raised with cool water from the RWST. This will
provide additional time to either restore the one train of SDC or take other actions to provide core cooling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A PRA showed that the operations in accordance with the proposed TS did not significantly increase the probabilities
of inventory boiling and core damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) delete the obsolete reference to the implementation of DCP 2-6863 and MMP 3-6863,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is an editorial change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) delete an obsolete footnote allowing removal of both trains of SDC with the water less than 23 feet above the reactor
vessel flange from the Unit 3 TSs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is an editorial change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would revise specifications associated with the cold leg accumulators (CLAs). Specifically,
the proposed amendment would: (1) remove a footnote from Specification 3.5.1.1.c that applied to Unit 2 Cycle 6 operation
only; (2) add a requirement to Specification 3.5.1.1 that power be removed from the CLA isolation valve when the reactor
coolant system pressure is above 2000 psig; (3) modify Specification 3.5.1.1 Action Statement a. to indicate that
with a CLA inoperable for reasons other than the boron concentration not being within limits, the CLA must be returned
to operable status within 1 hour or the plant placed in the hot standby condition, and the pressurizer pressure reduced
to 1000 psig or less within the next 6 hours; (4) modify Specification 3.5.1.1 Action Statement b. to indicate that
with a CLA inoperable because the boron concentration is not within limits, the boron concentration must be restored
to within limits within 72 hours or the plant placed in the hot standby condition within the next 6 hours and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pressurizer pressure reduced to 1000 psig or less within the next 6 hours; (5) remove the wording from Specification
4.5.1.1.1.a.1 for using the absence of alarms or level measurement as the technique used to verify CLA volume and pressure;
(6) add the requirement to Specification 4.5.1.1.1.a.2 to verify that the CLA isolation valve is ``fully open'' rather
than ``open;'' (7) modify Specification 4.5.1.1.1.b to show that verification of boron concentration is not required
for additions from the refueling water storage tank, and add a footnote to indicate that the verification is required
only if the affected accumulator experienced a volume increase; (8) modify Specification 4.5.1.1.1.c to show that
the test is satisfied by verifying that power is removed from the isolation valve, not that the valve operator is disconnected
by removal of the breaker from the circuit; (9) delete Specification 4.5.1.1.1.d to verify that each CLA isolation
valve opens automatically when reactor coolant pressure exceeds the P-11 setpoint, and upon receipt of a safety injection
signal; (10) delete Specification 4.5.1.1.2 to verify the accumulator water level and pressure channels operable
by performing Channel Functional and Calibration tests, and delete the related footnote; (11) change ``tanks''
to ``each cold leg injection accumulator;'' and (12) revise the associated Bases where necessary to reflect these
changes.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to TS 3.5.1.1 implement revised action times for cold leg injection accumulator (CLA) inoperability.
Several other clarifications and enhancements have been incorporated to provide consistency with the latest version
of standard TSs (NUREG-1431). The new action times provide a prompt one-hour action to initiate unit shutdown for
conditions that could prevent the injection of a CLA into the core. For boron concentration outside limits, a 72-hour
action to restore CLA concentration is allowed because the CLA can still perform the core injection safety function.
The removal of surveillance requirements (SRs) for verifying automatic opening features for the CLA isolation valves
does not impact the required TS alignment that is assumed in the safety analysis. The instrumentation calibration
and functional test SRs have also been removed based on the instrumentation only providing CLA level and pressure
indications for TS compliance and not performing an accident mitigation function. The above changes do not alter
the required limits for CLA operability or system configurations. These changes are consistent with NUREG-1431
and provide acceptable flexability[sic] for CLA operability verification and surveillance testing and reasonable
actions for CLA inoperability. Since no changes have been proposed that would change the conditions assumed for the
CLAs in the accident analysis, the consequences of an accident will not be increased. The CLAs perform accident mitigation
functions and are not considered to be the source of an accident. Therefore, since the plant configurations and functions
are unchanged by the proposed changes, the probability of an accident will not be increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes clarify existing CLA operability requirements, modify action times for CLA inoperability,
enhance and simplify SRs, and remove surveillances that are not required to verify the CLA's ability to perform safety
functions. None of these changes affect the operation of the plant or the CLA configuration and accident mitigation
capabilities. Therefore, since the CLAs will continue to support the plant as before, these proposed changes will
not create a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CLA requirements for volume, pressure, boron, and isolation valve position are not changed by the proposed request.
The CLAs will continue to provide the same safety function capabilities as assumed in the safety analysis. Therefore,
no reduction in the margin of safety will result from these chanes because CLA functions are unchanged.

The proposed change would add ``main steam vaults'' to the footnote of Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.1. This would
allow inspection of the valves, blind flanges, and deactivated automatic valves located in the vaults that are required
to be in the closed position during accident conditions and that are locked, sealed, or otherwise secured in the closed
position, on a cold shutdown frequency rather than every 31 days.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determine that it does not represent a
significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.93(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will exempt containment isolation valves in the east and west main steam valve vaults from examination
every thirty one days if those valves are locked, sealed or otherwise secured. The valves and flanges that are located
inside the main steam valve vaults and are required to be closed during accident conditions, will be verified in their
required position during cold shutdown and will be secured in this position. The environmental conditions in these
areas ensure they will be low traffic areas where the probability of misalignment or manipulation is remote. Loss
of containment integrity is not considered to be an initiator of any accident. This change does not affect any accident
analysis assumptions or results for SQN. Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated, as a result of this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revision will not change any plant equipment, system configurations, or accident assumptions. The appropriate
components in the valve vaults will continue to be verified in the closed position and locked, sealed, or otherwise
secured. The physical congestion and high temperatures in the area will be effective in maintaining this as a low traffic
area that will contribute to the low probability of misalignment or manipulation of these components between inspections.
Therefore, this change will not affect the safety function of these components and will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is consistent with current SQN accident analysis assumptions since only the time interval between
performances of the surveillance is being extended. This change will not impact any margin of safety.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications would remove the remaining references to cycle-specific parameters
in Technical Specification 3.12.A.2 and associated Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B. These figures
and the control bank insertion limits are presently specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). The NRC-approved
methodologies presently listed in the Technical Specifications are used to calculate and evaluate the parameter
limits presented in the COLR for each reload core.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, operation of Surry Power Station in accordance with the Technical Specification changes will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The removal
of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A
and 1B, from the Surry Technical Specifications has no influence or impact on the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment is administrative in nature in that it corrects omissions
from a previously approved amendment. This change has no impact on actions to be taken when or if limits are exceeded
as is required by the current Technical Specifications. Each accident analysis addressed in the Surry UFSAR [Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report] will be examined with respect to changes in cycle-dependent parameters, which are
determined by application of NRC-approved reload design methodologies. The impact of these parameter changes on
transient results is then evaluated to ensure that the results remain bounded by respective transient analysis acceptance
criteria. This examination, which is performed per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, ensures that future reloads
will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The removal
of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A
and 1B has no influence or impact, nor does it contribute in any way to the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operating characteristic will be
altered as a result of the proposed changes. This cycle-specific variable (control bank insertion limits) is calculated
using NRC approved methods, and the results are submitted to the NRC for information in accordance with Technical
Specification 6.2. The Technical Specifications will continue to require operation within the required core operating
limits, and appropriate actions will be taken when or if any of these limits are exceeded. Therefore, the proposed
amendment does not in any way create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety is not affected by this administrative
change which removes the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification
Figures 3.12-1A and 1B from the Technical Specifications. The margin of safety presently provided by current Technical
Specifications remains unchanged. Appropriate measures exist to control the values of these cycle-specific limits.
The proposed amendment continues to require operation within the core limits which were developed from the NRC-approved
reload design methodologies. Further, the actions to be taken when or if limits are violated remain unchanged. Development
of limits for future reloads will continue to conform to those methods described in NRC-approved documentation.
In addition, each reload requires a 10 CFR 50.59 safety review to assure that operation of the unit within the cycle-specific
limits will not involve a reduction in any margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes are administrative in
nature and do not impact the operation of Surry in a manner that involves a reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for Surry 1&amp;2 and North Anna 1&amp;2. Specifically,
the proposed changes would revise the: (1) Management Safety Review Committee (MSRC) review responsibilities regarding
safety evaluations and Station Nuclear Safety and Operating Committee (SNSOC) meeting minutes and reports, and
(2) SNSOC review responsibilities for procedure changes. However, the changes now also state that the MSRC will review

The North Anna and Surry Power Station Technical Specifications presently address the organization and responsibilities
of both the onsite and offsite review groups, the SNSOC and the MSRC, respectively. The responsibilities of the SNSOC
include the review of new procedures and changes to procedures that affect nuclear safety. The MSRC review responsibilities
include the review of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. It is proposed that the extent of these
review activities be revised in the Technical Specifications to ensure the two review groups are focusing on nuclear
safety issues and not spending an unnecessary amount of time on administrative activities of minimal safety significance.

[Specifically, operation in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes] will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. As administrative
changes, the proposed Technical Specifications changes have no direct or indirect effect on accident precursors.
No plant modifications are being implemented and operation of the plant is unchanged. SNSOC review of new procedures
and procedure changes that require a safety evaluation ensures that activities that could affect nuclear safety
are being properly reviewed. The MSRC's overview of representative samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting
minutes and reports based on performance ensures these programs are being properly implemented and nuclear safety
is not being compromised; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since physical
modifications are not involved and systems and components will be operated as before the change. The proposed changes
are wholly administrative in nature and have no impact on plant operations or accident considerations. These changes
modify the scope of SNSOC review of procedure changes and MSRC's review functions concerning safety evaluations
and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. Procedure changes will continue to receive management review in accordance
with administrative procedures, however, only changes that require a safety evaluation will require SNSOC approval.
MSRC review of representatives samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports based on performance
will continue to provide adequate assurance that nuclear safety is being properly considered; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as defined in the basis of any Technical Specification since
the responsibilities of the SNSOC and MSRC are not addressed by the existing Technical Specification Bases, nor are
review requirements for procedures. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on, nor
were they considered in, existing UFSAR accident analyses. Safety significant procedure changes, i.e., changes
that require a safety evaluation to be prepared, will continue to be reviewed by SNSOC, as will new procedures. Procedure
changes still require cognizant management approval and preparation of an activity screening to determine whether
or not the change impacts nuclear safety. This ensures activities important to nuclear safety are being appropriately
reviewed. The effectiveness of the safety evaluation program, and the thoroughness of SNSOC meetings and reports
will be assured through the MSRC's plant overview function which is based on observed performance.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.b.1 and
Figure TS 3.1-4 regarding Low Temperature Overpressure (LTOP) protection for the reactor coolant pressure boundary.
Currently, the TS specify the LTOP requirements through the end of operating cycle 20 or 17.14 effective full power
years. The proposed change extends the LTOP requirements through the end of operating cycle 21 or 18.40 effective
full power years. The Basis Section would also be modified to reflect these changes.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of RG 1.99, Revision 2, Regulatory Position C.2 does not modify the reactor coolant system pressure boundary,
nor make any physical changes to the facility design, material, construction standards, or setpoints. The probability
of a LTOP event occurring is independent of the pressure temperature limits for the RCS pressure boundary. Therefore,
the probability of a LTOP event occurring remains unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of predicted fluence values through the end of operating cycle 21 is appropriately considered within the calculations
in accordance with standard industry methodology previously docketed under WCAP 13227. Revised flux values were
used for Cycles 16, 17, 18 and 19 based on actual core reload designs. Previous cycles flux values are the same as reported
in WCAP 12333.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculation of pressure temperature limits in accordance with approved regulatory methods provides assurance
that reactor pressure vessel fracture toughness requirements are met and the integrity of the RCS pressure boundary
is maintained. Similar methodology was used in calculations to support approved amendment 108 to the Kewaunee Technical
Specifications dated April 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of Regulatory Position C.2 and fluence values through EOC 21 meet previously established criteria for protection
of the health and safety of the public. The consequences of a LTOP transient therefore, remain unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of Regulatory Position C.2 and fluence through EOC 21 does not modify the reactor coolant system pressure boundary,
nor make any physical changes to the LTOP setpoint or system design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, no new failure mechanisms are created that could create the possibility of an accident of a new or different
type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Appendix G pressure temperature limitations are calculated in accordance with regulatory requirements and
calculational limitations specified in RG 1.99, Revision 2. RG 1.99, Revision 2, is an acceptable method for implementing
the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendices G and H. Similar methodology was used in calculations to support approved
amendment 108 dated April 7, 1994. The reactor coolant pump starting restrictions of TS 3.1.a.1.c remain in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised calculations meet the NRC acceptance criteria for the LTOP setpoint and system design as described in
NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER) dated September 6, 1985 which concluded that ``the spectrum of postulated pressure
transients would be mitigated...such that the temperature pressure limits of Appendix G to 10 CFR 50 are maintained.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of Regulatory Position C.2, meets previously established criteria for the pressure temperature limits for
the LTOP system and setpoint. Thus, the margin of safety as described in the NRC SER is not reduced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by adding
two new sections, TS Section 3.0 and TS Section 4.0, with associated bases. TS Section 3.0 would establish the general
requirements applicable to each of the Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) within Section 3 of the KNPP TS. TS
Section 4.0 would establish the general requirements applicable to Surveillance Requirements. The new requirements
of TS 4.0.b would also affect TS Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and Tables TS 4.1-2 and 4.1-3. The proposed TS amendment incorporates
guidance statements similar to Section 3.0/4.0 of NUREG-0452, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse
Pressurized Water Reactors.''

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The likelihood that an accident will occur is neither increased or decreased by these TS changes. These TS changes
will not impact the function or method of operation of plant equipment. Thus, there is not a significant increase in
the probability of a previously analyzed accident due to these changes. No systems, equipment, or components are
affected by the proposed changes. Thus, the consequences of the malfunction of equipment important to safety previously
evaluated in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) are not increased by these changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes have no impact on accident initiators or plant equipment, and thus, do not affect the probabilities
or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are consistent with the requirements established in the Westinghouse STS. Therefore, the proposed
changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. Since these changes do
not contribute to accident initiation, they do not produce a new accident scenario or produce a new type of equipment
malfunction. Also, these changes do not alter any existing accident scenarios; they do not affect equipment or its
operation, and thus, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. The proposed changes do not affect plant equipment or operation. Safety limits and limiting safety system
settings are not affected by these proposed changes. These changes are consistent with the Westinghouse STS.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment makes a one-time change to Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.C for Hatch Unit 1 regarding the emergency
diesel generator (DG) operability requirements during reactor shutdown conditions. Current TS 3.9.C requires
that two DGs be operable during reactor shutdown when a core or containment cooling system is required to be operable.
The amendment revises the current requirement such that only one emergency DG is required to be aligned to its associated
core or containment cooling system during a specific time of the outage. During this time period the decay heat removal
(DHR) system will be in service. The DHR system, which is completely independent of the existing shutdown cooling
system, is powered by the Baxley substation and has its own DG as a backup power supply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant Unit
Nos. 1 and 2 to specify an alternate method of determining water and sediment content for new diesel fuel oil as specified
in TS 3/4.8.1.1, ``A.C. Sources - Operating.'' Specifically, TS 4.8.1.1.3c.1(d) is revised to allow new fuel oil
to be tested using a ``clear and bright'' test or a quantitative test that verifies a water and sediment content less
than or equal to 0.05 volume percent when the oil is tested in accordance with ASTM D1796-83.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By November
14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Hydrogeology &amp; Geochemistry Panel and Structural Geology
&amp; Geoengineering Panel will hold a joint meeting with the Department of Energy (DOE) on Thursday, November 17,
and Friday, November 18, 1994, in Washington D.C. The meeting will be held at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, 1500 New Hampshire
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036; Tel (800) 841&hyph;0003 or (202) 483&hyph;6000; Fax (202) 328&hyph;3265. The
meeting, which is open to the public, will run from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. on Thursday, November 17, then continue on
Friday, November 18, from 8:00 A.M. to noon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the meeting is to review thermal management issues related to the high-level radioactive waste repository
proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Primary issues to be discussed at the meeting are the DOE's emerging waste isolation
strategy, the key thermal decisions to be made and the decision-making process involved, and potential programmatic
risks related to the DOE's thermal management strategy. Representatives from the DOE, its contractors, and other
organizations have been invited to participate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues to be discussed on the first day include alternative thermal management strategies and the Yucca Mountain
site thermal response. A round-table discussion will close the first day's activities. On the second day, participants
will define and discuss the in-situ thermal testing needs and techniques for analyzing the performance of the proposed
repository and the process for making a thermal management decision. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been
invited to present its perspective on various safety issues. A wrap-up session with summary presentations from participants
will end the meeting at noon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Broad was created in the 1987 Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act to evaluate the
technical and scientific activities of the DOE's civilian radioactive waste management program, including site
characterization, storage, and transport. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by
the DOE for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense
high-level waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria
Reich, Board librarian, beginning December 30, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. First ING Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of New York, and is the depositor and sponsor
of the Account. First ING Life may establish one or more Other Accounts in the future, for which it will serve as sponsor
and depositor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. First ING Life established the Account on March 15, 1994 under the laws of New York pursuant to a resolution of its
Board of Directors. The Account is a segregated asset account of First ING Life, and is registered under the 1940 Act
as a unit investment trust. The underlying investment media for the Account will be Neuberger &amp; Berman Advisers
Management Trust, Van Eck Investment Trust, Fidelity Variable Insurance Products Fund, Fidelity Variable Insurance
Products Fund II, Alger American Fund and INVESCO Variable Investment Funds (each, a ``Fund''). Each Fund is registered
under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. SLD Equities, a registered broker-dealer, will be the principal underwriter of the Account Contracts. SLD Equities
may act as a principal underwriter for any Other Contracts issued by First ING Life in the future.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The Contracts provide retirement payments or other long-term benefits for persons covered under plans qualified
for federal income tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for persons desiring such
benefits who do not qualify for such tax advantages. Holders of the Contracts will direct purchase payments to one
of several Divisions of the Separate Account or to the Guaranteed Interest Division (which is part of First ING Life's
general account). Payments directed to the Separate Account then will be invested by the Divisions in shares of corresponding
portfolios of the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The minimum initial purchase payment for a Contract is $5,000 for a non-qualified Contract and $1,000 for a qualified
Contract. The minimum additional purchase payment is $500 for a non-qualified Contract, $250 for a qualified Contract,
and $90 for a qualified Contract on a monthly program of purchase payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No front-end sales charge will be imposed when purchase payments are applied under the Contracts. However, a surrender
charge will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts are taken
during the six year period from the date First ING Life receives and accepts each purchase payment. The surrender charge
is determined by the number of Contract anniversaries that have passed since the purchase payment that is being withdrawn
was made. The charge is 7% if no Contract anniversary has passed with respect to the payment. 6% if one Contract Anniversary
has passed, and declines by 1% per year thereafter. No surrender charge applies to a purchase payment that has been
held for 6 Contract anniversaries or more. In no event is the surrender charge greater than the amount withdrawn. Proceeds
from the surrender charge may not cover the expected costs of distributing the Contracts. Any shortfall will be recovered
from First ING Life's general assets, which may include revenue from the proposed mortality and expense risk charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The administrative charges to be assessed will be (a) an annual administrative charge of $30 per Contract year,
during the accumulation period only, if total purchase payments paid in the first Contract year are less than $100,000,
and (b) a daily asset charge, at an annual effective rate of 0.15% assessed against each Division of the Separate Account,
during both the accumulation and annuity periods. First ING Life guarantees that it will not raise these administrative
charges for the duration of the Contracts. First ING Life also represents that it does not expect that the total revenues
from the administrative charges will be greater than the total expected cost of administering the Contracts, on average,
excluding costs that are properly categorized as distribution expenses, over the period that the Contracts are in
force.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. If more than one demand partial withdrawal occurs during a Contract year, there will be a charge of the lesser of $25
or 2% of the amount withdrawn for each additional demand partial withdrawal. In addition, each transfer in excess
of 12 in a Contract year will be subject to a charge of $25. Applicants indicate that the partial withdrawal transaction
charge and excess transfer charge will meet the ``at cost'' requirement of Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. First ING Life will assume certain risks, described below, in connection with its sale of the Contracts. Accordingly,
First ING Life proposes to receive compensation for assuming these risks by deducting, from the assets of the Separate
Account, a daily asset charge for mortality and expense risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. First ING Life will assume several mortality risks under the Contracts. First, First ING Life will assume a mortality
risk by its contractual obligation to pay a death benefit to the beneficiary if the Owner dies prior to the annuity date.
The Contracts provide a death benefit that is the greater of: (a) the accumulation value at the time of death and (b)
the step-up benefit plus purchase payments made, less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal
transaction charges taken since the last step-up anniversary. Second, First ING Life assumes a mortality risk arising
from the fact that the Contract does not impose any surrender charge on the death benefit. Third, First ING Life assumes
an additional mortality risk by its contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life
of the Annuitant under annuity options involving life contingencies. This assures each Annuitant that neither the
Annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the annuity
payments received under a Contract. This relieves the Annuitant from the risk of outliving the amounts accumulated
for retirement. At the same time, First ING Life assumes the risk that Annuitants as a group would live a longer time
than First ING Life's annuity tables predict, which would require First ING Life to pay out more in annuity income than
planned. The Contracts contain annuity tables that are based on the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality Table and,
for variable annuity options, alternative net investment factors of 3% or 5% and, for fixed annuity options, and interest
rate of 3%. First ING Life guarantees these annuity tables for the life of a Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. In addition to mortality risks, First ING life will assume an expense risk under the Contracts. This is because
the administrative charges under outstanding Contracts, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to cover actual
administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. In order to receive compensation for assuming these mortality and expense risks, First ING Life will assess the
Separate Account with a daily charge for mortality and expense risks at an annual aggregate rate of 1.25% Approximately
0.90% of this annual charge is allocated to the mortality risks that First ING Life will assume, and 0.35% is allocated
to the expense risks that First ING Life will assume.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. If the administrative charges and the mortality and expense risk charges are insufficient to cover the expenses
and costs assumed, the loss will be borne by First ING Life. Conversely, if the amounts deducted prove more than sufficient,
the excess will be profit to First ING Life. First ING Life will likely earn a profit from the mortality and expense risk
charge.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to
permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Account under the Contracts.
Applicants state that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Other Contracts funded by the Account or
any Other Account, in the future, are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants
state that, without the requested relief, Applicants would have to request and obtain exemptive relief in connection
with Other Contracts under certain circumstances. Any such additional request for exemption would present no issues
under the 1940 Act that have not already been addressed in this application. Applicants submit that the requested
relief is appropriate in the public interest, because it would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract
market by eliminating the need for First ING Life to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its
administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. The delay and expense involved in having
to repeatedly seek exemptive relief would impair First ING Life's ability to effectively take advantage of business
opportunities as they arise. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes
of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If First ING Life were required to repeatedly seek
exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive any benefit
or additional protection thereby. Indeed, they might be disadvantaged as a result of First ING Life's increased overhead
expenses. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested exemption id appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter
thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a
trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an
agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee,
not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% is reasonable in relation to the risks
assumed by First ING Life under the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect
to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly
available information about similar industry practices, and by taking into consideration such factors as current
charge levels and benefits provided, the existence of expense charge guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates.
First ING Life undertakes to maintain at its home office, and make available to the Commission and its staff upon request,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology used in making the foregoing determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The surrender charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In that
event, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset
by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the surrender charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, First ING Life
has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will
benefit the Separate Account and Owners. First ING Life also represents that it will maintain at its home office, and
make available on request to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting out the basis for such conclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

), that the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
approval for extensions on the following previously approved rules and forms:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 206(4)&hyph;2 governs the custody or possession of funds or securities by registered investment advisers.
There are approximately 604 registrants subject to rule 206(4)&hyph;2 for a total of 75,500 burden hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 0&hyph;2 requires certain non-resident persons to furnish to the Commission a written irrevocable consent
and power of attorney that designates the Commission as an agent for service of process, and that stipulates and agrees
that any civil suit or action against such person may be commenced by service of process on the Commission. Regulations
279.4, 279.5, 279.6, and 279.7 designate Forms 4&hyph;R, 5&hyph;R, 6&hyph;R, and 7&hyph;R as the irrevocable appointments
of agent for service of process, pleadings and other papers to be filed by an individual nonresident adviser or an unincorporated
nonresident investment adviser, a partnership nonresident investment adviser, or a nonresident general partner
of an investment adviser, or a nonresident ``managing agent'' of an unincorporated investment adviser, respectively,
which is registered or applying for registration with the Commission as an investment adviser. There are approximately
300 registrants subject to rule 0&hyph;2 for a total of 300 burden hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form 2&hyph;E is the form that a small business investment company that has engaged in a limited offering of its securities
uses to report semiannually the progress of the offering, including the number of shares sold. Each respondent spends
approximately 10 hours annually reporting on Form 2&hyph;E.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. SBSA is a company organized and existing under the laws of South Africa. SBSA is authorized and regulated in South
Africa by the Office of Banks, Registrar of Banks of South Africa. As of December 31, 1993, SBSA had shareholders' equity
of 3.3 billion South African Rand (U.S.$945 million).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SBSA requests an order to permit it, as the custodian or subcustodian of foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents
(collectively the ``Assets'') of investment companies (other than investment companies registered under section
7(d) of the Act), to maintain such assets in the custody of Stanbic Merchant Bank of Nigeria, Ltd. and Merchant Bank
(Ghana), Ltd. (collectively, the ``Foreign Affiliates'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. SBSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Bank Investment Corporation, Ltd. (``SBIC''). SBIC owns 40 percent
of the voting stock of Stanbic Merchant Bank of Nigeria, Ltd. and 30 percent of the voting stock of Merchant Bank (Ghana),
Ltd. Each Foreign Affiliate is a bank incorporated under the laws of a country other than the United States and is regulated
as such by the relevant country's government or an agency thereof.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(f) of the Act provides that a registered investment company may place and maintain its securities and
similar assets in the custody of a bank, or banks meeting the requirements of section 26(a) of the Act, a member firm
of a national securities exchange, the investment company itself, or a system for the central handling of securities
established by a national securities exchange. Section 2(a)(5) of the Act defines ``bank'' to include banking institutions
organized under the laws of the United States, member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and certain other banking
institutions or trust companies doing business under the laws of any state or of the United States. Neither SBSA nor
the Foreign Affiliates falls within the definition of ``bank'' as that term is defined in the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Rule 17f&hyph;5 specifies entities located outside the United States that are eligible to serve as custodian for
investment company assets. One such entity is a banking institution or trust company incorporated or organized under
the laws of a country other than the United States that is regulated as such by the country's government or an agency
thereof and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S. $200 million. SBSA qualifies as an eligible foreign custodian.
The Foreign Affiliates do not qualify as eligible foreign custodians under rule 17f&hyph;5 only because they do not
meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBSA agrees that an order granting the requested relief may be conditioned upon the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed foreign custody arrangements regarding the Foreign Affiliates satisfy the requirements of rule
17f&hyph;5 in all respects other than the Foreign Affiliates' level of shareholders' equity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SBSA will deposit the Assets with a Foreign Affiliate only in accordance with an agreement (the ``Agreement'')
required to remain in effect at all times during which the Foreign Affiliate fails to satisfy the requirements of rule
17f&hyph;5. Each Agreement will be a three-party agreement among SBSA, the Foreign Affiliate and the U.S. investment
company (or its custodian). Under the Agreement, SBSA will undertake to provide specified custodial or subcustodial
services for a U.S. investment company or its custodian, and will delegate to the Foreign Affiliate such of the duties
and obligations of SBSA as will be necessary to permit the Foreign Affiliate to hold in custody the U.S. investment
company's Assets in the relevant country. The Agreement will further provide that SBSA will be liable for any loss,
damage, cost, expense, liability, or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by the Foreign Affiliate
of its responsibilities under the Agreement to the same extent as if SBSA had been required to provide custody services
under such agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. SBSA currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders equity requirement set forth in
rule 17f&hyph;5(c)(2)(i) under the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. SBSA is a company organized and existing under the laws of South Africa. SBSA is authorized and regulated in South
Africa by the Office of Banks, Registrar of Banks of South Africa. As of December 31, 1993, SBSA had shareholders' equity
of 3.3 billion South African Rand (U.S. $925 million).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SBSA requests an order to permit it, as the custodian or subcustodian of foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents
(collectively the ``Assets'') of investment companies (other than investment companies registered under section
7(d) of the Act), to maintain such assets in the custody of the following entities: Stanbic Bank Botswana, Ltd., Stanbic
Bank Kenya, Ltd., Standard Bank Namibia, Ltd., Stanbic Bank Uganda, Ltd., Stanbic Bank Swaziland, Ltd., Stanbic
Bank Zaire, s.z.a.r.l., Stanbic Bank Zambia, Ltd., and Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe, Ltd. (collectively, the ``Foreign
Affiliates'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Foreign Affiliates are direct subsidiaries of Applicant or SBIC Africa Holdings, Ltd. (``SBIC Africa'').
SBSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Bank Investment Corporation, Ltd. (``SBIC'') and SBIC Africa is a wholly-owned,
direct subsidiary of SBIC. Each Foreign Affiliate is a bank incorporated under the laws of a country other than the
United States and is regulated as such by the relevant country's government or an agency thereof.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(f) of the Act provides that a registered investment company may place and maintain its securities and
similar assets in the custody of a bank or banks meeting the requirements of section 26(a) of the Act, a member firm of
a national securities exchange, the investment company itself, or a system for the central handling of securities
established by a national securities exchange. Section 2(a)(5) of the Act defines ``bank'' to include banking institutions
organized under the laws of the United States, member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and certain other banking
institutions or trust companies doing business under the laws of any state or the United States. Neither SBSA nor the
Foreign Affiliates falls within the definition of ``bank'' as that term is defined in the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Rule 17F&hyph;5 specifies entities located outside the United States that are eligible to serve as custodian for
investment company assets. One such entity is a banking institution or trust company incorporated or organized under
the laws of a country other than the United States that is regulated as such by the country's government or an agency
thereof and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S. $200 million. SBSA qualifies as a an eligible foreign custodian.
The Foreign Affiliates do not qualify as eligible foreign custodian under rule 17f&hyph;5 only because they do not
meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBSA agrees that an order granting the requested relief may be conditioned upon the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed foreign custody arrangements regarding the Foreign Affiliates satisfy the requirements of rule
17f&hyph;5 in all respects other than the Foreign Affiliates' level of shareholders' equity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SBSA will deposit the Assets with a Foreign Affiliate only in accordance with an agreement (the ``Agreement'')
required to remain in effect at all times during which the Foreign Affiliate fails to satisfy the requirements of rule
17f&hyph;5. Each Agreement will be a three-party agreement among SBSA, the Foreign Affiliate and the U.S. investment
company (or its custodian). Under the Agreement, SBSA will undertake to provide specified custodial or subcustodial
services for a U.S. investment company or its custodian, and will delegate to the Foreign Affiliate such of the duties
and obligations of SBSA as will be necessary to permit the Foreign Affiliate to hold in custody the U.S. investment
company's Assets in the relevant country. The Agreement will further provide that SBSA will be liable for any loss,
damage, cost, expense, liability, or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by the Foreign Affiliate
of its responsibilities under the Agreement to the same extent as if SBSA had been required to provide custody services
under such agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. SBSA currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders equity requirement set forth in
rule 17f&hyph;5(C)(2)(i) under the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trust is a registered open-end management investment company that currently offers shares in five series.
Each existing or future series of the Trust is referred to herein as a ``Fund.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Adviser is a registered investment adviser that serves as investment adviser to all five series of the Trust.
The Distributor serves as principal underwriter to the Trust. The Adviser is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Distributor.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Applicants request that any order also apply to any open-end investment company advised by the Adviser or any entity
controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser, or for which the Distributor or any entity controlled by or
under common control with the Distributor serves as principal underwriter and that (a) hereafter becomes part of
the same ``group of investment companies,'' as defined in rule 11a&hyph;3, and (b) issues classes of shares that are
identical in all material respects to the classes described in this application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants seek an order to permit each of the Funds to offer multiple classes of shares (the ``Multiple Class System'').
The Funds initially will issue four classes of shares. The requested order also will permit each Fund to assess a CDSC
on redemptions of certain classes of shares, and waive the CDSC under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Class A shares generally will be offered at net asset value plus a front-end sales charge. Class A shares will be sold
without a front-end sales charge, however, but rather will be subject to a CDSC if they were purchased (a) in an amount
greater than a specified amount (currently expected to be $1 million) or (b) with the proceeds from the redemption
or sale of shares of another investment company (which redemption did not result in the payment by the investor of a
CDSC). The CDSC for such Class A shares will be at an expected rate of up to 1% if they are redeemed within four years after
purchase. In addition, all Class A shares will be subject to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing fee of up
to .25% of the average daily net assets of the class annually..
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Class B shares will be offered without a front-end sales charge, but will be subject to a CDSC at an expected rate of
up to 1% on redemptions within the first year after purchase. In addition, the shares will bear rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution
fees of up to .75% (.50% in the case of some Funds) and a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing fee of up to .25% of
the average daily net assets of the class annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Class C shares will be subject to a variable rate CDSC (declining over time) for a period of several years after purchase.
Applicants currently expect that the percentage of the CDSC generally will vary from 6% for redemptions made during
the first year from initial purchase to 1% for redemptions made during the sixth year from purchase. In addition, Class
C shares will bear rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fees of up to .75%, and a non-rule 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing expense of up to .25%, of the average daily net assets of the class annually. Class
C will automatically convert into Class A shares after a specified period (currently expected to be six years) from
the date of purchase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Class D shares will be offered without any sales charges or rule 12b&hyph;1 fees. Class D shares will be offered only
to certain qualified institutional investors that wish to make very large investments. Investors eligible to purchase
Class D shares will include tax-qualified employee benefit plans, endowment funds, foundations, and other tax-exempt
organizations and certain insurance company separate accounts.

The minimum initial investment amount will be $25,000 or less for Class A, Class B and Class C shares and $1,000,000
for Class D shares. These amounts may be changed from time to time, but it is anticipated that, even if the specific amounts
change, the Class A, Class B, and Class C shares would continue to have a low minimum investment, while Class D shares
would have a much higher minimum investment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The net asset value of all outstanding shares of all classes of a Fund will be computed by allocating gross income
and expenses to each class based on the net assets attributable to each class, except for rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, shareholder
servicing expenses, and ``Class Expenses,'' as defined in condition 1 below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Class C shares will automatically convert into Class A shares or shares of classes created in the future which are
identical in all material respects to the Class A shares after a specified period (not to exceed six years) following
the purchase date. Class C shares acquired by exchange from Class C shares of another Fund will convert into Class A
shares based on the time of the initial purchase. Class C shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and
other distributions paid in respect of Class C shares will convert into Class A shares at the same time as the shares
with respect to which they were purchased are converted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants expect that shares of each Fund may be exchanged for shares of the same respective class in any other
fund, without payment of an additional sales charge. All exchange privileges applicable to each class will comply
with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. No CDSC will be imposed with respect to: (a) redemptions of shares that were purchased more than a specified number
of years prior to the redemptions: (b) shares derived from reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions;
or (c) the amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation.
The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net
asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents such percentage of the net asset value
of the shares at the time of redemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares
representing reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions and then of other shares held by the shareholder
for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate. In
addition, redemption requests placed by shareholders who own shares of more than one class will be satisfied first
by redeeming the shareholder's shares of the class or classes not subject to a CDSC, unless the shareholder has specifically
elected to redeem shares which are subject to a CDSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares issued prior to the effective date of the order granting exemptive relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants request relief to permit each Fund to waive or reduce the CDSC in certain circumstances. Any waiver
or reduction will comply with the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d&hyph;1 under the Act.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) to issue multiple
classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe that, by implementing
the multiple class distribution system, the Funds would be able to facilitate the distribution of their shares and
permit shareholders to receive the benefits of mutual fund services and distribution arrangements and the added
benefits of scale and other advantages that may result from combining investors' assets in a single portfolio. Applicants
also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate against
any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, affect the Funds' existing assets
or reserves, or increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and
rule 22c&hyph;1, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants believe
that the CDSC arrangement would permit shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working
for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales charge had been imposed.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) the impact of the disproportionate payments made under the rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan and the
shareholder services plan, and any Class Expenses which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees attributable to a
specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such
as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) Blue Sky registration
fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) administrative services
fees payable under each class' respective administrative services agreement, if any; and (vi) any other incremental
expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the Commission
pursuant to an amended order; (b) voting rights on matters which pertain to rule 12b&hyph;1 plans except as provided
in condition 2 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (d) the designation of each class
of shares of a Fund; and (e) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature.

2. If a Fund implements any amendments to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder service plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares under the plan into which another class will convert (the ``Target Class''), shares
of the class that will convert (the ``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into the Target Class unless the Purchase
Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take such action as is
necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (the
``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to covert into the Target Class. If deemed
advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (the ``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class or the New Purchase
Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall
be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance
with condition 6, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class
or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser or Distributor. The Purchase Class shares sold after
the implementation of the proposal may convert into the Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment,
provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class
shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based
sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall have approved the Multiple Class
System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Class System by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of
the Trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Class
System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Class System is in the best interests of
both the Funds and their respective shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent
charges thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees.
Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses,
rule 12b&hyph;1 fees and shareholder servicing fees shall provide to the Trustees, and the Trustees shall review,
at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will
monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes or shares.
The Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and Distributor will be responsible for reporting any
potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and Distributor at their own costs
will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The Trustees of the Trust will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will
be used to support any distribution or servicing fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. Expenditures
not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will not be presented to the Trustees to justify
any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject
to the review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Each shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, and on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
the rule 12b&hyph;1 plans relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by such class and except
that any Class Expense and shareholder servicing expenses will be borne exclusively by the applicable class of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to applicants (and such report has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the application)
that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in
an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner
in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually
a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall
be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act.
The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make,
will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior
member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director,
an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, any Assistant Director, and any Regional
Administrator or associate and Assistant Administrator. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies
and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed
in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be
amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper
allocation of expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert
in the initial report referred to in condition 10 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 10 above. Applicants
agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the
ongoing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to
one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agrees to conform to these standards.

15. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset values and public offering prices will present each class
of shares separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the requested exemptive order will not imply Commission approval or
authorization of or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1
plans or shareholder services plans in reliance on the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (November 2, 1988), as the rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 22, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' OR ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, PHLX Rule 101, ``Hours of Business,'' provides that the foreign currency option (``FCO'') trading session
will be conducted between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. each business day. The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 101 to provide
that FCO trading will be conducted between 2:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. each business day. Thus, the PHLX will move the opening
of FCO trading from 1:30 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. Eastern time (``ET'') for all PHLX-listed FCOs except the Canadian dollar,
which will continue to commence trading at 7:00 a.m. ET each business day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the PHLX, the Exchange's FCO trading hours for the last nine months have commenced at 1:30 a.m. ET each
Monday through Friday and terminated at 2:30 p.m. ET on the afternoon of each trading day. The PHLX states that over
the past nine months, less than one percent of the PHLX's FCO volume was generated during the 1:30 a.m. ET to 2:30 a.m.
ET time period. Upon the recommendation of the Exchange's FCO Committee, a standing committee of the Board of Governors
(``Board''), the Board approved the proposed adjustment in trading hours to change the commencement of FCO trading
from 1:30 a.m. ET to 2:30 a.m. ET. The proposal is designed to ease the staffing burden on current registered FCO specialist
units as well as floor brokerage units and registered option trader firms. The PHLX proposes to implement the adjusted
2:30 a.m. ET commencement of FCO trading on October 31, 1994, to coordinate with the resumption of trading during Eastern

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed change is to extend the waiver of certain Exchange fees for trades in CXM through December
31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among members using its facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore
has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

5. SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
To obtain a United States passport, a travel document attesting to one's identify and U.S. citizenship, a U.S. national
must complete the passport application (22 U.S.C. 213). The application is retained in the files of the Department
of State and is consulted when a passport has been lost, in citizenship claims, as evidence in the prosecution of individuals
making false statements, and to support a derivative claim to citizenship made by an applicant's children. The following
summarizes the information collection proposal submitted to OMB:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A nine (9) count indictment was returned on June 22, 1994, in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia,
charging Lockheed Corporation (Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, a division of Lockheed Corporation), Suleiman
A. Nassar (employee of Lockheed Corporation International S.A.) and Allen R. Love (employee of Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems) with conspiracy (18 U.S.C. &sect;371) to violate and violation of section 104 of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;78dd&hyph;1 and 78ff(c)(2). The indictment charges that the defendants conspired to retain
a consultant, who was a member of the Egyptian Parliament, to use influence with Egyptian government officials in
an effort to assist Lockheed in procuring a contract for the sale of three C&hyph;130 Hercules Aircraft to Government
of Egypt. (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 22, 1994, the Department of State instituted a policy of denial of all requests for licenses and other written
approvals (including all activities under manufacturing license and technical assistance agreements) concerning
exports of defense articles and provision of defense services, by, for or to, or involving directly or indirectly,
the above-named defendants and any of their subsidiaries or successor entities. Furthermore, the Department precluded
the use in connection with those defendants of any exemptions from license or other approval included in the ITAR except
as those exemptions directly pertain to licenses or other written approvals granted prior to June 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been taken pursuant to sections 38 and 42 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2778
&amp; 2791) and 22 CFR 126.7(a)(2) and 126.7(a)(3) of the ITAR. It will remain in force until rescinded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exceptions may be made to this denial policy on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Office of Defense Trade
Controls. However, such an exception would be granted only after a full review of all circumstances, paying particular
attention to the following factors: whether an exception is warranted by overriding U.S. foreign policy or national
security interests; whether an exception would further law enforcement concerns; and whether other compelling
circumstances exist which are consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States,
and which do not conflict with law enforcement concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of a recent review of the policy involving indicted persons, a person (as defined at 22 CFR 120.14) named
in an indictment for an AECA-related violation may submit a written request for reconsideration of the denial decision
to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such request for reconsideration should be supported by evidence of remedial
measures taken to prevent future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR and other pertinent documented information
showing that the person would not be a risk for future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR. The Office of Defense Trade
Controls will evaluate the submission in consultation with the Departments of Treasury, Justice, and other necessary
agencies. After a decision on the request for reconsideration has been rendered by the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military
Affairs, the requester will be notified whether the exception has been granted.

The purpose of the meetings is to discuss the Coast Guard's implementation plan, and to obtain input from and educate
the affected community and general public with regard to revised procedures and planned innovations. The planned
centralization is part of the Coast Guard's ongoing efforts to provide the maximum service to the maritime community,
while seeking to reduce costs. The implementation plan describes in general terms the steps and procedures which
the Coast Guard will follow in achieving centralization while maintaining full customer service.

This notice announces the decision by NHTSA that 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 passenger cars not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United
States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the 1994 Mercedes-Benz
S320), and they are capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;009) petitioned NHTSA
to decide whether 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA
published notice of the petition on August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40958) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader
is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response to the
notice. Based on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has decided to grant the petition.

Liphardt &amp; Associates, Inc. of Ronkonkoma, New York (``Liphardt'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;004) has
petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1990 BMW 750iL passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which Liphardt believes is substantially similar is the 1990 BMW 750iL that was manufactured for importation
into and sale in, the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer, Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1990 BMW 750iL to its U.S. certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liphardt submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1990 BMW 750iL,
as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.
certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petition claims that the non-U.S. certified 1990 BMW 750iL is identical to its U.S. certified counterpart
with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1971 MGB GT that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

Under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the

G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&amp;K'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;007)
has petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1971 MGB GT passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1971 MGB GT that was manufactured for importation
into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer, British Leyland Motor Corp., Ltd., as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1971 MGB GT to its U.S. certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1971 MGB GT,
as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.
certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1971 MGB GT is identical to its U.S. certified counterpart
with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Champagne Imports Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;009) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 560SEL (Model ID 126.039) passenger cars are eligible for importation
into the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1990 Mercedes-Benz
560SEL that Daimler Benze A.G. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 560SEL to its U.S.-certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 560SEL,
as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.-certified
counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1990 model 560SEL is identical to the U.S.-certified
1990 model 560SEL with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice advises the public that Customs proposes a change of practice regarding the tariff classification of
three classes of imported glassware: ``containers of glass used for the conveyance or packing of goods'', ``preserving
jars of glass'' and ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes''. The principal use of these classes or
kinds of glassware, whether it be conveying or packing solid or liquid products, home canning or household storage,
determines its classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After intensive review of the three classes of imported glassware, it has been determined advisable to set forth factors
which Customs proposes to use when determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs proposes that ``containers of glass used for the conveyance or packing of goods'' includes glass articles
that are part of the exchange or buying and selling of commodities that are principally used to convey a product to a
consumer who uses the product and then discards the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs proposes that ``preserving jars of glass'' includes only various glass articles which are the typical size
and shape of ``Mason-type'' jars. Because the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has determined that glass jars
with wire bails and glass caps (non ``Mason-type'') are not recommended for home canning, and these type of jars are
often advertised and sold in sets of varying sizes for use in the storage of dry goods in the home, Customs proposes to
change its practice of classifying them as ``preserving jars of glass'' to the more appropriate class, glassware
of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Customs proposes that the class ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes'' includes glass
household storage articles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent with Customs proposed change of practice would be revoked. Before
adopting this proposed change of practice, consideration will be given to any written comments regarding the scope
of all three of these classes (especially the characteristics which are indicative of each class) which are timely
submitted in response to publication of this document.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs proposes a change of practice involving the tariff classification of three classes of imported glass articles
under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). This requires an examination of subheadings 7010.90.50
and 7013.39, HTSUS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HTSUS subheadings read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subheadings 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, are considered ``use'' provisions. There are two principal types of
classification by use: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) According to the use of the class or kind of goods to which the imported article belongs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) According to the actual use of the imported article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use according to the class or kind of goods to which the imported article belongs is more prevalent in the tariff schedule.
A few tariff provisions expressly state that classification is based on the use of the class or kind of goods to which
the imported article belongs. However, in most instances, this type of classification is inferred from the language
used in a particular provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an article is classifiable according to the use of the class or kind of goods to which it belongs, Additional U.S.
Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, provides that: [i]n the absence of special language or context which otherwise
requires_ (a) a tariff classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance
with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind
to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use. In other words, the article's principal
use at the time of importation determines whether it is classifiable within a particular class or kind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, provides general criteria for discerning the principal
use of an article, it does not provide specific criteria for individual tariff provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) has provided factors, which are indicative but not conclusive,
to apply when determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind. They include: general physical
characteristics, the expectation of the ultimate purchaser, channels of trade, environment of sale (accompanying
accessories, manner of advertisement and display), use in the same manner as merchandise which defines the class,
economic practicality of so using the import, and recognition in the trade of this use. See:

Tariff classification of goods controlled by actual use is specifically provided for in sections 10.131&hyph;10.139,
Customs Regulations [19 CFR 10.131&hyph;10.139]. According to these regulations, an actual use provision is satisfied
if: (1) such use is intended at the time of importation, (2) the article is so used, and (3) proof of such use is furnished
within three years after the date the article has been entered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, tariff classification under both subheading 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, is determined by the use
of the class or kind of articles to which the imported merchandise belongs. As such, they are considered provisions
controlled by Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs current position regarding subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, is in accord with the findings of the CIT in

held that the language of heading 7010, HTSUS, implicates use as a criterion of classification for that entire heading,
which includes subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, and that principal use was the controlling use. Additionally, the
court held that the phrase ``of the kind'' preceding the words ``used for'' did not constitute a special language or
context. See Sturm, Ruth, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
vol. 2., sec. 53.3, p. 28. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs proposes no changes in this regard. Subheadings 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, would remain principal use
provisions. Therefore, for an imported good to be classifiable in either of these subheadings, it must be of the class
or kind of articles classifiable in these subheadings. Whether it is of the class or kind of articles classifiable
in either subheading will be determined by its principal use. Principal use will, in turn, be determined by the specific
criteria formulated to determine to what class or kind the imported goods belong. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the plain language of the provision, Customs is of the opinion that subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, includes
the classes ``glass containers of a kind used for the conveyance or packing of goods'' and ``preserving jars of glass''.

In understanding the language of the HTSUS, Customs consults the ENs. The ENs, although not dispositive, provide
a commentary on the scope of each heading of the Harmonized System and are thus useful in ascertaining the classification
of merchandise. Customs believes that they should be consulted for guidance in determining the proper interpretation
of the HTSUS. See T.D. 89&hyph;80, 54 FR 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN 70.10, pg. 933&hyph;934, states, in pertinent
part, that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This heading covers all glass containers of the kinds commonly used commercially for the conveyance or packing of
liquids or of solid products (powders, granules, etc.). They include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Carboys, demijohns, bottles (including syphon vases), phials and similar containers, of all shapes and sizes,
used as containers for chemical products (acids, etc.) beverages, oils, meat extracts, perfumery preparations,
pharmaceutical products, inks, glues, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These articles, formerly produced by blowing, are now almost invariably manufactured by machines which automatically
feed molten glass into moulds where the finished articles are formed by the action of compressed air. They are usually
made of ordinary glass (colourless or coloured) although some bottles (e.g., for perfumes) may be made of lead crystal,
and certain large carboys are made of fused quartz or other fused silica *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These containers remain in this heading even if they are ground, cut, sand-blasted, etched or engraved, or decorated
(this applies, in particular, to certain perfume or liqueur bottles), banded, wickered or otherwise trimmed with
various materials (wicker, straw, raffia, metal, etc.); they may also have tumbler-caps fitted to the neck. They
may be fitted with drop measuring devices or may be graduated, provided that they are not of a kind used as laboratory
glassware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Jars, pots and similar containers for the conveyance or packing of certain foodstuffs *&blank;*&blank;*, pharmaceutical
products, *&blank;*&blank;* polishes, cleaning preparations, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These articles are usually made of ordinary glass (colourless or tinted) by pressure in a mould usually followed by
blowing with compressed air. They generally have a large opening, a short neck (if any) and as a rule, a lip or flange
to hold the lid or cap. Some of these containers, however may be closed by corks or screwstoppers.

In HRL 087359, dated August 8, 1990, Customs explained the phrase ``commercially used to convey'', as used in the ENs,
when referring to the class of glass containers commercially used to convey solid or liquid products. The ruling stated,
in pertinent part, that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The key phrase in this instance is ``commonly used commercially for the conveyance'' of liquids. The root word of ``commercially''
is commerce which is described as the exchange or buying and selling of commodities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on this ruling, Customs current position is that the principal use for the class ``containers used for the conveyance
or packing of goods'' is that glass articles of this class be part of the exchange or buying and selling of commodities,
and be used to convey or pack a product to a consumer who then uses the product and discards the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the Kraft case, the ENs and the relevant HRLs, Customs believes that together, they provide specific
identifiable characteristics which are indicative, but not conclusive of whether a particular glass article qualifies
as part of the class ``containers of glass of a kind used for the conveyance or packing of goods''. These characteristics
would include, containers, of all shapes and sizes:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. generally having a large opening, a short neck (if any) and as a rule, a lip or flange to hold the lid or cap, made of ordinary
glass (colourless or coloured) and manufactured by machines which automatically feed molten glass into moulds where
the finished articles are formed by the action of compressed air; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. in which the ultimate purchaser's primary expectation is to discard the container after the conveyed or packed
goods are used; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. sold from the importer to a wholesaler/distributor who then packs them with goods; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. sold in an environment of sale that features the goods packed in the jar and not the jar itself; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. used to commercially convey foodstuffs, beverages, oils, meat extracts, etc.;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. capable of being used in the hot packing process; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. recognized in the trade as used primarily to pack and convey goods to a consumer who then discards the container after
this initial use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs current position is that the physical characteristics of a particular glass article are the primary indicator
of whether it belongs to the class ``containers of a kind used for the packing or conveyance of goods''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kraft discussed a container's ability to be used in the ``hot packing'' process as a possible indicator that a particular
container was of a kind used for the packing or conveyance of goods. However, it is Customs understanding that most
glassware is capable of being used in the ``hot packing'' process. Therefore, whether a particular container is capable
of being used in the ``hot packing'' process, is of limited utility when determining whether it is classifiable as
a container of a kind used for the packing or conveyance of goods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs proposes to continue to apply the standards outlined above with one addition. The proposed addition involves
glass containers imported without their corresponding caps or lids. Based on observations of importations, Customs
proposed position is that ``glass containers imported without their corresponding caps or lids'' is an additional
physical characteristic that indicates that particular containers will be used for the conveyance or packing of
goods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We realize that subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, provides for containers imported with or without their lids. However,
Customs proposed position is that whether containers are, or are not, imported with lids is a distinct indication
of their use.

Preserving Jars of Glass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs present position regarding the class ``preserving jars of glass'' is that it provides for various articles
which are the typical size and shape of ``Mason-type'' jars. Whether a particular glass jar is a preserving jar is presently
determined on a case-by-case basis. Customs does, however, consider volumes of between .23 liters and 2.2 liters
and a shape and height of a typical Mason jar (e.g., not multi-sided) to be indicative, but not conclusive, physical
characteristics of a preserving jar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This understanding is based on relevant HRLs and the ENs. In HRL 087727, dated September 21, 1990, Customs ruled that
the class ``preserving jars of glass is limited to merchandise in the sizes and shapes of typical `Mason-type' preserving
jars which hold the volumes typical of preserve jars (i.e., one half pint to one half gallon).'' Additionally, EN 70.10
pg. 933&hyph;934, states, in pertinent part, that ``[t]he heading also includes preserving jars of glass''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preserving jars are not defined in the heading or ENs. A tariff term that is not defined in the HTSUS or in the ENs is construed
in accordance with its common and commercial meaning.

Based upon the above definition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Extension Service, Complete Guide to Home Canning:
Guide 1 Principles of Home Canning (Agricultural Information Bulletin No. 539&hyph;1, May 1989), and consultation
with members of the home canning trade, Customs proposed position is that the principal use for the class ``preserving
jars of glass'' is jars purchased and used for home canning only. Further, Customs understands that there are identifiable
characteristics that are indicative, but not conclusive of the principal use of glass jars classifiable as ``preserving
jars of glass''. These would include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Glass articles of any shape that are between .23 and 2.2 liter sizes, and are regular and wide-mouth ``Mason-type'',
threaded, home-canning jars with self-sealing lids.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the standard jar mouth opening is about 23/8 inches with wide mouth jars having 3 inch openings. ``Mason-type''
jars have narrower sealing surfaces and are tempered less than most commercial pint and quart-size jars. The common
self-sealing lid consists of a flat metal lid held in place by a metal screw band during processing. The flat lid is crimped
around its bottom edge to form a trough, which is filled with a colored gasket compound. These physical criteria are
based on Customs understanding of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Extension Service, Complete Guide to Home
Canning: Guide 1 Principles of Home Canning (Agricultural Information Bulletin No. 539&hyph;1, May 1989), pgs.
14&hyph;15 and discussion with members of the trade.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, on page 11 of the above mentioned bulletin, under the subtitle ``Equipment and methods not recommended'',
this publication indicates that jars with wire bails and glass caps and one-piece zinc porcelain lined caps are not
recommended for home canning. We note that these ``non Mason-type'' jars are often advertised and sold in sets of varying
sizes for use in the storage of goods in the home. Thus, it is Customs proposed position that they are classifiable under
subheading 7013.39, HTSUS.

Glassware of a Kind Used for Table or Kitchen Purposes Glass Storage Articles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the plain language of the heading, Customs is of the opinion that subheading 7013.39, HTSUS, provides for
the class ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs position is based on exemplars from EN 70.13, which we believe demonstrate that the class ``glassware of a
kind used for table or kitchen purposes'' provides for certain glass articles principally used for household storage.
EN 70.13, pg. 936&hyph;937, states, in pertinent part, that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]his heading covers the following types of articles, most of which are obtained by pressing or blowing in moulds:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) [T]able or kitchen glassware, e.g., drinking glasses, goblets, tankards, decanters, infants' feeding bottles,
pitchers, jugs, plates, salad bowls, sugar-bowls, sauce-boats, fruit-stands, cake-stands, hors-d'oeuvres dishes,
bowls, basins, egg-cups, butter dishes, oil or vinegar cruets, dishes (for serving, cooking, etc.) stew-pans, casseroles,
trays, salt cellars, sugar sifters, knife-rests, mixers, table hand bells, coffee-pots and coffee-filters, sweetmeat
boxes, graduated kitchenware, plate warmers, table mats, certain parts of domestic churns, cups for coffee-mills,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs understands that the exemplars listed are articles principally used to hold or store other articles in the
home. We believe that among these articles, certain glass storage jars may also be principally used in this fashion.
Therefore, glass articles which are principally used to store articles in the home are classifiable under subheading
7013.39, HTSUS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the ENs, relevant HRL's, and applying the principal use factors, which are indicative but not conclusive,
for determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind, Customs has identified the following
characteristics which we believe are indicative, but not conclusive of glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen
purposes; glass household storage articles. They are glass articles:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Made of ordinary glass, lead crystal glass, glass having a low coefficient of expansion (e.g., borosilicate glass)
or of glass ceramics (the latter two in particular, for kitchen glassware). They may also be colourless, coloured
or of flashed glass, and may be cut, frosted, etched or engraved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Having a decorative motif consistent with a kitchen decor (e.g., geese, ``country theme'', etc.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Which the consumer purchases primarily to use for storage in the home; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Sold from the importer to a wholesaler/distributor who then sells them to a retailer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Sold in an environment of sale that emphasizes the article's use or reuse as a storage article; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Sold to the ultimate purchaser empty; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Which are recognized in the trade as primarily having a household storage use; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This understanding is based on the above cited EN and relevant HRLs. HRL 953282, dated February 16, 1993, classified
a 1 liter glass jar decorated with a blue ribbon and decalmania which created a country motif band in blue, pink, green
and yellow around the middle of the jar. Customs held that, while the container did convey goods, its decoration, lid,
and environment of sale all indicated that the principal use of the container was for storage, not the conveyance of
goods. See also, HRL 087727, dated September 21, 1990, which classified spice jars as household storage jars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs proposes to continue to apply the standards outlined above. We note that due to the USDA report's recommendation
that glass articles with wire bale and trigger closures (non ``Mason-type'') not be used for home canning, but rather
as storage articles for dry ingredients, all glass articles with wire bale trigger closures and glass caps or lids
will be classifiable under subheading 7013.39, HTSUS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, we note that there are glass articles capable of both conveyance or packing of goods and household storage,
as demonstrated in the Kraft case. Instances of these types of articles will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with
the above outlined characteristics determining the article's principal use and classification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. Section 10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury
Department, 15th and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC, on November 1 and 2, 1994, of the following debt management
advisory committee:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on November 1, followed
by a charge by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working
session. On November 2, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on November 1 and will be open to the
public. The remaining sessions on November 1 and the committee's reporting session on November 2 will be closed to
the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. Section 10(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C.
App. Section 10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101&hyph;05, that the closed portions of the meeting
are concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. Section 552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest
requires that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice
from representatives of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations.
Historically, this advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major
segments of the financial community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee
under 5 U.S.C. App. Section 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports
of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to
lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption
covered by 5 U.S.C. Section 552b(c)(9)(A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance is responsible for maintaining records of debt management
advisory committee meetings and for providing annual reports setting forth a summary of committee activities and
such other matters as may be informative to the pubic consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. Section 552b.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent
of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance. This determination
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, sets forth
the rules relating to the determination process.

Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 29, 1994, the Secretary determined that phosphorous trichloride and phosphorous pentasulfide should
be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective January 1, 1995. The rate of tax prescribed
for phosphorous trichloride, under section 4671(b)(3), is $3.10 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for
phosphorous of 0.23 and a conversion factor for chlorine of 0.77.

Identification of Trade Expansion Priorities Pursuant to Executive Order 12901

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This report is submitted pursuant to Executive Order 12901 of March 3, 1994. Under the Executive Order the United States
Trade Representative is required, by September 30, 1994, to ``review United States trade expansion priorities and
identify priority foreign country practices, the elimination of which is likely to have the most significant potential
to increase United States exports, either directly or through the establishment of a beneficial precedent.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In identifying priority foreign country practices, the Trade Representative must take into account all relevant
factors, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The major barriers and trade distorting practices described in the National Trade Estimate Report;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The trade agreements to which a foreign country is a party and its compliance with those agreements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The medium-term and long-term implications of foreign government procurement plans; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) The international competitive position and export potential of United States products and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Executive Order permits the Trade Representative to include, if appropriate, ``a description of the foreign
country practices that may in the future warrant identification as priority foreign country practices.'' The Trade
Representative may also include ``a statement about other foreign country practices that were not identified because
they are already being addressed by provisions of United States trade law, existing bilateral trade agreements,
or in trade negotiations with other countries and progress is being made toward their elimination.''

The Global Context
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes in the world economy, reinforced by the end of the Cold War, have opened up new opportunities in the global marketplace.
The United States is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. We are unsurpassed in innovation
and flexibility. Gains in productivity have fueled our competitiveness. Our higher education is unsurpassed. Our
workers are the most skilled and productive in the world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This new world is extremely competitive. In order to remain successful, we must pursue a strategy consisting of two
interrelated parts: trade policies that will open markets around the world; and domestic policies that will help
American companies and workers to remain the most productive in the world. This two-part strategy reflects the Administration's
fundamental goal of higher living standards for all Americans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The single most important component of our trade strategy is the successful implementation of the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations. The Uruguay Round agreements amount to a global tax cut of some $744 billion. They
will stimulate the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and, when fully implemented, add an estimated $100&hyph;200
billion to the U.S. GDP annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Uruguay Round agreements contain improvements in market access worldwide for goods and services, improved rules
for trade, a new agreement protecting intellectual property worldwide, and dramatically improved procedures to
enforce our rights. The improvements in dispute settlement under the new World Trade Organization (WTO) can provide
real assurance to our exports that our gains at the bargaining table will be translated into real market opportunities,
and that any impairment of our rights to market access will have an expeditious remedy. But these benefits, scheduled
to go into effect on January 1, 1995, will materialize only if Congress has adopted legislation approving and implementing
the Uruguay Round agreements. For this reason, the Administration urges expeditious approval of the Uruguay Round
Agreements Act, which the President submitted to Congress on September 27.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration remains committed to vigorous enforcement of our rights under trade agreements_both our rights
at present, and the expanded rights we will have when the Uruguay Round results enter into effect. Section 301 will
remain an essential element of our strategy in enforcing our rights in the new WTO system. Under WTO dispute settlement
procedures, we will be authorized to retaliate against the trade of any government found to be violating our rights,
if that government does not either eliminate the violation or provide compensation acceptable to us. Such realization
would be carried out under the authority of section 301 as a matter of U.S. trade law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301 will also remain an important tool in addressing unfair practices not covered under the Uruguay Round
agreements. And it will be available to us when we encounter trade-restricting practices by either non-members of
the WTO or governments to which we do not apply the Uruguay Round agreements.

Priority Foreign Country Practices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the review under Executive Order 12901 and the results to date of intensive negotiations, the Trade Representative
has decided not to identify any priority foreign country practices at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have had serious, long-standing concerns regarding access to the Japanese market for flat glass. We have reached
agreement with Japan in principle concerning access to the distribution system and access to the public and private
construction markets for flat glass in Japan, and have also agreed to work to finalize that agreement within the next
thirty days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Practices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The following practices may in the future warrant identification as priority foreign country practices:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Japan market access for wood and paper:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1990 U.S.-Japan Wood Products Agreement, Japan agreed to substantially reduce tariffs, to reduce subsidies,
to speed up product certification, and to adopt performance-based standards and building codes. Progress has been
made, but new or existing barriers continue to impede market access. Tariffs, although reduced in the Uruguay Round,
remain a significant impediment. Adoption of performance-based standards and building codes has been slow and Japan
maintains a parallel unliberalized set of building standards for housing loans. Subsidies to the wood products industry
appear to have risen. We seek further market opening through the elimination of these remaining barriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1992, Japan agreed to take GATT-consistent measures to increase substantially market access in Japan for
foreign paper and paperboard products, to realize the objective in the January 1992 Bush-Miyazawa action plan of
January 1992 ``to substantially increase market access for foreign firms exporting paper products to Japan.'' Four
consultations have been held under the agreement. In the Uruguay Round, Japan agreed to join a Quad country consensus
to cut tariffs on paper to zero over 10 years. However, Japan has failed to provide detailed information on the degree
to which Japanese government agencies are implementing provisions which obligate them to actively encourage use
of foreign products by end-users in key market segments. We seek a full accounting by all appropriate entities within
the Japanese government on their implementation of the agreement, as well as other measures to augment the agreement
and make it more effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The following foreign country practices were determined not to be appropriate for identification because they
are already being addressed by other provisions of United States trade law, existing bilateral agreements, or in
trade negotiations with other countries and progress is being made toward their elimination. They do, however, remain
significant trade negotiating objectives for the United States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_European Union Utilities Directive: Under the European Union's Utilities Directive, which took effect on January
1, 1993, telecommunications utilities in 8 EU member countries now penalize bids by U.S. suppliers containing over
50% non-EU content and May reject such bids completely. In May 1993, the U.S. implemented sanctions against the EU
under Title VII of the 1988 Trade Act. These sanctions ban the purchase by the U.S. government of certain goods and services
from these 8 countries. We will continue to seek removal of the discriminatory aspects of the Directive through negotiation
with the EU.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Canada dairy and poultry measures: In implementing the Uruguay Round, Canada intends to convert its existing import
quotas on dairy products, chicken, turkey and eggs to tariff-rate quotas, and raise its bound tariffs on these products.
Canada has also stated its intention to apply these tariffs on imports from the United States. We believe such an action
would reduce our access to the Canadian market. If it becomes appropriate, this matter could be addressed through
the NAFTA process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_India market access for textiles: India severely restricts imports of textiles and apparel, and maintains high
tariffs. In implementing the Uruguay Round, the Administration has agreed to take all appropriate measures to obtain
market access commitments from any signatory to the WTO Agreement that is a significant exporter of textiles and apparel
to the United Sates and that we consider has failed to provide adequate access to its market for U.S. textile and apparel
products. We are currently engaged in negotiations with the Indian government and will continue to seek improvements
in market access for textiles and apparel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Korea market access for automobiles: Actions by the Korean government have built and reinforced perceptions among
Korean consumers that the purchase of a foreign car will lead to government harassment. Other barriers to imports
include excise taxes, high tariffs, standards barriers, distribution restrictions and a ban on 
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->
&blank;private sector retail financing. The Korean government has taken some steps to address these barriers and
has pledged to take others. Our continuing consultations are aimed at ensuring that the remaining barriers are addressed
and that the Korean government's actions result in improved access for imported motor vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Intellectual property rights protection ion China: On June 30, through the ``Special 301'' process under Section
182 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2242), the Trade Representative designated China as a priority foreign
country, and initiated a section 301 investigation of China's failure to provide adequate and effective protection
of intellectual property rights and fair and equitable market access to persons relying on intellectual property
protection. Negotiations with the Chinese government to address these concerns are ongoing. By December 31, 1994,
the Trade Representative will be required to determine whether China's failure to address our concerns represents
an unreasonable or discriminatory burden or restriction on U.S. commerce and whether trade action is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Financial services market access negotiations: The WTO Agreement provides for continuing market access negotiations
in the financial services sector, to conclude six months after its entry into force. The United States is seeking commitments
from a wide range of commercially important developed and developing countries to reduce or eliminate barriers to
the supply by U.S. financial services firms of financial services including banking, securities, insurance and
other financial services. If we do not achieve our objectives, we would maintain an exemption from the most-favored-nation
obligation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Telecommunications market access: The WTO Agreement provides for continuing market access negotiations in the
basic telecommunications services sector. These negotiations cover local, long-distance, and international
basic telecommunications services. In these negotiations, we will seek to ensure that U.S. firms may provide basic
telecommunications services in foreign markets both through facilities-based competition_including the right
to build, own, and operate domestic and international network facilities_and through the resale of services on existing
networks. We will also seek to ensure that U.S. companies can compete in foreign markets on reasonable and non-discriminatory
rates, terms, and conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Negotiations on accession to the World Trade Organization: The United States will also continue to seek market opening
for our goods and services, and to achieve protection of intellectual property rights abroad, in negotiating with
countries that are seeking admission as members to the World Trade Organization. The Agreement Establishing the
WTO requires that all members must provide market access, and the Administration is committed to gaining appropriate
market access from every applicant for membership.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Missing and Exploited Children's Program is administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
(OJJDP). Pursuant to the provisions of Section 406 (a)(2) the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of
1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5576), OJJDP is publishing for public comment both a proposed long range plan and its Fiscal
Year 1995 program priorities for activities authorized under Title IV, the Missing Children's Act (42 U.S.C. 5651&hyph;5665a),
of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Taking into consideration comments received on the proposed long range plan and program priorities, OJJDP will
develop and publish a Final long range plan and its Fiscal Year 1995 Program Priorities. The long range plan will describe
the Office's goals and strategies for Title IV activities over the next three years and specify particular program
activities OJJDP anticipates funding during Fiscal Year 1995 using Title IV funds.

Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Long Range Plan is designed to orchestrate the use of funds allocated by Congress under Title IV for services to
be provided to missing and exploited children and their families. OJJDP will use the Long Range Plan to establish a
series of goals, strategies, and programs. In total, the Plan will help OJJDP set annual priorities, develop program
goals and objectives, select applicants for award, and deliver technical assistance and training to the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Long Range Plan was developed by evaluating documents such as research reports, program publications,
and working papers available from Title IV fund recipients that address issues related to Title IV. The National Center
for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) provided the results of two focus groups involving parents and law enforcement
personnel who have been involved in family abduction cases reported to NCMEC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two work sessions were held involving a multi-disciplinary group of attendees who were asked to identify critical
issues that should be addressed by a Title IV Long Range Plan. Those sessions included Title IV grantees as well as representatives
from other Federal agencies who deal with programs and services related to missing and exploited children. Input
gathered through these work sessions was given great weight in developing the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Nature of the Problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Much has been written by practitioners and researchers regarding the three major problem areas addressed by Title
IV: family abductions; non-family abductions; and child exploitation. The Long Range Plan takes into account current
knowledge about these three major categories of child victimization and the impact these events have on children
and families. The statistics and analysis on the following pages were obtained from the 1990 National Incidence Study
of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Thrownaway Children in America (NISMART). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Family Abduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are an estimated 354,100 family abductions a year. Forty-six percent of these (an estimated 163,200 abductions)
involve concealment of the child, transporting the child out of state, or an intent by the abductor to keep the child
indefinitely or to permanently alter custody. Of this more serious category of abductions, a little over half are
perpetrated by men, noncustodial fathers and father figures. Most victims are children from ages 2 to 11. Half involve
unauthorized takings while half involve failures to return the child after an authorized visit or stay. Fifteen percent
of these abductions involve the use of force or violence and 75 to 85 percent involve interstate transportation of
the child. About half of family abductions occur before the marital relationship ends. Another 41 percent did not
occur until two or more years after a divorce or separation, usually after parents develop new households, move away,
develop new relationships, or become disenchanted with the legal system. Over half occur in the context of relationships
with a history of domestic violence. An estimated 49 percent of abductors have criminal records. A significant number
have a history of violent behavior, substance abuse, or emotional disturbance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Abducted children suffer significant harm. It is not uncommon for child victims of family abduction to have their
names and appearance altered, to experience medical or physical neglect, unstable schooling, homelessness, or
frequent moves. They are often told lies about the abduction and the left-behind parent, even that the left-behind
parent is dead. Many child victims of family abduction experience substantial psychological consequences and emotional
distress. Trauma symptoms may be evident for up to four or five years after recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-Family Abduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An estimated 3,200 to 4,600 short-term non-family abductions are known to law enforcement each year. Of these, an
estimated 200 to 300 are stereotypical kidnappings where a child is gone overnight, is killed, is transported a distance
of 50 miles or more, or where the perpetrator intends to keep the child permanently. Young teenagers and girls are the
most common victims. Two-thirds of short-term abductions involve a sexual assault. A majority of the victims are
abducted from the street. Over 85 percent involve force, and over 75 percent involve use of a weapon. Most episodes
last less than a day. The number of short-term abductions is considered by most researchers and practitioners to be
underestimated due to police reporting methods and lack of reporting on the part of victims. Based on FBI data, there
were an estimated 43 to 147 stranger abduction homicides of children annually between 1976 and 1987. There are an estimated
114,600 attempted non-family (stranger) abductions each year, usually involving an attempt to lure a child into
a car. In a majority of these cases, the police were not contacted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Child Exploitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Children are at risk of being victimized as the result of a wide range of circumstances that fall into essentially three
categories; running away, being thrownaway by parents or guardians, or being otherwise lost or missing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 446,700 runaways from households each year. In addition, an estimated 12,800 children run
from juvenile facilities. Many children who run from households also run from facilities. About one third of these
runaways left home or a juvenile facility more than once. Of all runaways, 133,500 are without a secure and familiar
place to stay during their episode. More than a third of runaways run away more than once during the year. One in 10 go
a distance of more than 100 miles. Of runaways from juvenile facilities, almost one-half leave the state. Runaways
are mostly teenagers but almost 10 percent were aged 11 and younger. They tend to come disproportionately from step-parent
households. Family conflict seems to be the heart of most runaway episodes. Between 60 and 70 percent report being
seriously abused physically. Sexual abuse estimates range from 25 to 80 percent. Runaways, particularly chronic
runaways, are at higher risk for physical and sexual victimization, substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases,
unintended pregnancies, violence, and suicide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 127,100 thrownaway children who are directly told to leave the household, have been away from
home and are not allowed back by a caretaker, whose caretaker makes no effort to recover a child who has run away, or who
has been abandoned or deserted. By comparison, there is 1 child who is a thrownaway for every 4 that are runaways. An
estimated 59,200 thrownaway children are without a secure and familiar place to stay during the episode. Most thrownaways
are older teenagers, but abandoned children tend to be young (half under the age of 4). Thrownaways are concentrated
in low income families and families without both natural parents. Compared to runaways, thrownaways experience
more violence and conflict within their families and are less likely to return home.

There are an estimated 438,200 children who are lost, injured, or otherwise missing each year. Of these, 139,100 cases
are serious enough that the police are called. Almost half involve children under 4. Most of these episodes last less
than a day. A fifth of the children experienced physical harm. Fourteen percent of the children were abused or assaulted
during the episode.

Impact on Children and Families:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The majority of families of missing children experience substantial psychological consequences and emotional
distress. The level of emotional distress equals or exceeds the emotional distress for other groups of individuals
exposed to trauma, such as combat veterans and victims of rape/assault/other violent crime. Families where the missing
child is subsequently recovered deceased exhibit the highest level of emotional distress. Once home, a third of the
missing children live in constant fear of a reabduction. Almost four-fifths of victims and families of missing children
do not receive mental health or counseling services.

The Missing Children's Assistance Act of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended
describes services that the Administrator shall consider for funding. They are: establish and operate a national
24 hour toll-free telephone line and operate a national resource center and clearinghouse; coordinate public and
private programs which locate, recover, or reunite missing children with their legal custodians; to disseminate
nationally, information about innovative and model missing children's programs, services, and legislation; provide
technical assistance and training to law enforcement agencies, State and local governments, elements of the criminal
justice system, public and private nonprofit agencies, and individuals in the prevention, investigation, prosecution,
and treatment of the missing and exploited child case and in locating and recovering missing children; periodically
conduct national incidence studies; provide information to lawful use of school records and birth certificates
to identify and locate missing children; and to educate parents, children, and community agencies and organizations
in ways to prevent the abduction and sexual exploitation of children. The following critical issues describe needs
that should be addressed through a Long Range Plan for Title IV. They were the result of two work sessions held for the
purpose of developing this plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;Training at the community level for agency staffs. Not enough training is available to inform professionals
in a wide range of agencies about the relationship between missing and exploited children's issues and other community
problems. This training should promote the implementation of multi-disciplinary approaches and formal inter-agency
cooperation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;Identifying the missing and exploited children problem in communities. Too many communities do not recognize
in measurable terms the nature and scope of problems of missing children and various forms of child exploitation.
Many communities do not recognize that they have a missing children problem. As a result, system-wide planning for
the allocation of resources does not address issues related to missing and exploited children and their families.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;Developing executive level commitment. Executives of criminal and juvenile justice agencies who have
responsibility for missing and exploited children cases have not been adequately targeted to receive information
and training related to missing and exploited children. As a result, missing and exploited childrens' issues have
not been given the level of priority necessary to effect change. Insufficient emphasis has been placed on distilling
research and evaluation findings into information that is relevant to policy makers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;Availability of Missing and Exploited Children programs on community and child safety. Community services
for missing children should be integrated into a larger community effort to promote child protection and overall
safety of neighborhoods. Community services should do more to promote child safety through linkages among the wide
range of community agencies that come in contact with missing and exploited children and their families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;Training that provides communities with useful tools. Training should be practical, be targeted to specific
audiences, and provide communities with tools that can be used immediately to assess needs and reduce duplication
in the utilization of resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;Developing a Missing and Exploited Children Training Plan. A training plan using Title IV funds should be
developed that aligns training products and services to meet specific goals. Training should be used as a tool to market
services funded through Title IV.

 *&blank;Creating stronger linkages between human service agencies, the criminal justice system, and the juvenile

 *&blank;Developing a plan for marketing services available to communities through Title IV. A coherent plan of action
needs to be developed and implemented to expand the understanding of the services that are available to missing children
and their families from Missing Children grantees. Teleconferencing and other new technologies should be used to
promote more awareness of the dimensions of problems addressed by Title IV. State Clearinghouses could play a more
active role in disseminating information regarding missing and exploited children.

 *&blank;Further defining the role of non-profit organizations. The wide range of services provided by non-profit
organizations continues to evolve. As a result, there is a need to continue to define the role of these organizations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;Continuing the evolution of the role of State Clearinghouses. The number of state clearinghouses has grown
slowly but steadily. The roles of these organizations vary from state to state. Title IV has funded technical assistance

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comprehensive Title IV training needs assessment for professionals and non-profit organizations who deal with
missing and exploited children and their families is needed. The training needs assessment should be updated regularly
to assure that OJJDP is apprised of emerging training needs in the field. OJJDP grantees should be asked to develop
training and technical assistance materials on effective practices that are developed during the course of their
projects. OJJDP should hold periodic meetings of Title IV grantees to promote information sharing and to assist OJJDP
in developing new methods that can be shared with other communities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This three year cooperative agreement will fund the operation of a national resource center and clearinghouse as
mandated in Section 404(b) (42 U.S.C. 5773). The clearinghouse is responsible for establishing and operating a 24
hour toll-free telephone line by which individuals may report information regarding the location of any missing
child, or other child 13 years of age or younger, whose whereabouts are unknown to such child's legal custodian, and
request information pertaining to procedures necessary to reunite the child and legal custodian. In addition, the
clearinghouse will be responsible for providing a wide range of assistance to State and local governments, public
and private non-profit agencies, and individuals. Specific assistance includes coordinating public and private
programs which locate, recover, or reunite missing children with their legal guardians, provide training and technical
assistance, disseminate information about innovative and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV Training and Technical Assistance $750,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OJJDP, through its Missing Children's Program, is committed to support the agencies and organizations that deliver
services related to the prevention of missing and exploited children cases, the location of missing children, the
recovery of those children, and the successful reunification of missing children to their legal guardian(s). Through
funding of relevant research and program demonstration projects, OJJDP produces information and work products
of use to agencies, organizations, victims, and families. OJJDP seeks to disseminate such information and work products
through the delivery of training and technical assistance to law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, schools, human
service agencies, medical service providers, non-profit organizations, and any other appropriate entity that
provides services to missing and exploited children and their families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To coordinate the delivery of information, work products, training, and technical assistance, OJJDP will issue
a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development and management of an efficient and effective technical assistance
and training program for Title IV funded activities. The RFP will include services related to the design, development
and delivery of all new Title IV training and technical assistance based on work products and other results generated
by the experience of other Title IV grantees. The successful contractor will be responsible for incorporating existing
Title IV funded training into new programs where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OJJDP believes that this approach will standardize the training being delivered through Title IV, more efficiently
make use of Title IV funding, and strengthen quality control for the delivery of training and technical assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Private non-profit organizations (NPOs) in communities provide a vital service to the families of missing and exploited
children. These organizations were formed to play a role that is best fulfilled by community members who provide support
to each other during the ordeal many parents and children experience in missing and exploited children cases. Over
the last two years, private non-profit organizations have taken steps to further develop the quality and level services
to include forming a national organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This three year program, to be awarded in two 18 month budget periods, is designed to provide training and technical
assistance that will support the continuing development of NPOs as a resource for providing services in communities
that other agencies may not be best suited to provide. This training and technical assistance would focus on assisting
NPOs in developing protocols that can be used to tailor their mission, goals, and services to the needs of communities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will support up to five demonstration sites that have active missing and exploited children programs
in place and seek to strengthen the role of NPOs in providing services. Technical assistance will also be provided
on a request basis to individual NPO's. The applicant should consider missing and exploited children programs in
local community organizations as possible sites as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products that would be generated as a result of this project would include, but not be limited to, standardized intake
forms, procedures for communication with other agencies, guidelines for establishing a multi-disciplinary board
of directors, and an overall handbook for the operation of an NPO that is tailored to the delivery of services to missing
and exploited children and their families.

This is a program that is jointly funded with $50,000 of Title IV funds and $50,000 from the Office for Victims of Crime
(OVC). In Fiscal Year 1995 this program will develop and implement prototype multi-jurisdictional task forces for
the investigation and prosecution of cases involving sexual exploitation of children. These tasks forces are to
be formed in up to five communities throughout the United States that include Federal, state, and local authorities.

Funds for this project cannot be used for law enforcement efforts, but must be targeted to assist child and youth victims
in crisis, to provide staff training, and promote public awareness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the second year of a cooperative agreement between OJJDP, OVC and the Education Development Center, Inc. No
additional applications will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this program, OJJDP makes available all data sets produced as the result of funded research addressing missing
and exploited children and their families in a readily understandable, documented data archive. OJJDP provides
this service through a cooperative agreement with the University of Michigan whose staff prepare missing and exploited
children data and documentation to conform to generally accepted standards. No additional applications will be
solicited in Fiscal Year 1995.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 5, 1995, President Clinton signed Public Law 103&hyph;272, which codifies Federal transit laws under title
49, chapter 53 of the United States Code. The enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;272 repeals the FT Act without substantive
change, which means that the original meaning of the FT Act provisions are unchanged by this codification, even though
the new language in some instances differs from that of the FT Act. The codification includes laws enacted through
June 30, 1993. Provisions enacted after that date, and revisions to title 49, chapter 53, will be reflected in subsequent
legislation now being drafted in Congress. This Notice accordingly uses the new form of citation followed by the relevant
FT Act citation in parentheses. Listed below are the most commonly used citations:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FTA urges that grantees incorporate to the extent possible the concepts of ``livable communities'' into the transit
and planning projects funded with Federal assistance being made available by this Notice and funds transferred from
highway programs. The Livable Communities Initiative recognizes that transit programs can be instrumental in shaping
the nature of community development and represent an important tool for enhancing the vitality of individual communities
and neighborhoods served by our regional transit systems. Transit facilities and stations can become energetic
local activity centers providing convenient shopping, business, and educational opportunities as well as other
needed social services like health and day care. They can serve as focal points for attractive mixed used development.
Transit services, appropriately sized to community needs, can bind the community together and provide an environmentally
attractive alternative to automobile travel and a safe and affordable means of transport for those who might otherwise
find it difficult to have full access to community activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Livable communities concepts include: (1) Careful coordination of transit planning with community development
planning leading to neighborhoods where housing, schools, and parks are within easy walking distance of user-friendly
transit that links residents with local social and economic services and jobs; (2) alternatives to the automobile
such as transit, pedestrian, and bicycle access and operational improvements such as guaranteed ride home services,
neighborhood shuttles, and user-friendly fare collection systems that encourage transit use; (3) mixed-use neighborhoods
with residential areas complemented by office and commercial development, green or open spaces, and public services
(also transit facilities such as major bus stops or train stations are designed to include , other enterprises that
are useful to transit passengers, e.g., day care centers); (4) safe, secure, and customer-friendly streets, transit
facilities, and pedestrian walkways; and (5) full community participation in the decision-making process by neighborhood
organizations, small and minority businesses, and interested individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA will soon be issuing guidance on the Livable Communities Initiative. This initiative will highlight and demonstrate
the benefits of livable communities by providing technical assistance along with a limited amount of funding for
planning and capital grants.

C. 1996 Summer Olympic Games 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1995 DOT Appropriations Act has made available $16,000,000 for costs associated with unique transportation
requirements of the Centennial Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, which will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, in
summer 1996. These funds will be used for the round-trip delivery costs and preparation of roughly 2,000 buses being
made available by transit authorities around the country to support the unique transportation requirements of the
Olympic and Paralympic Games.

D. Project Management Set-Aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 U.S.C. 5327 (formerly Section 23 of the FT Act), allows the Secretary of Transportation to use not more than one-half
of one percent of the funds made available under the Capital Program, the Urbanized Area Formula and Nonurbanized
Area Formula Programs, the National Capital Transportation Act, as amended, and the Interstate Substitute Transit
Program, and an additional one-quarter of one percent of Capital Program funds, to contract with any person to oversee
the construction of any major project under these statutory programs and to conduct safety, procurement, management
and financial reviews and audits. Therefore, one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for fiscal year 1995
for the programs noted above, and three-quarters of one percent of Capital Program funds have been reserved for this
purpose before apportionment of the funds.

A. Total Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the appropriated fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula funds of $2,283,921,213, the apportionment
also includes $24,351,386 in deobligated Urbanized Area Formula funds (including formerly Section 5 formula funds)
which have become available for reapportionment under the Urbanized Area Formula Program as provided for under 49
U.S.C. 5336(i) (formerly section 9(o)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 2 displays the amount apportioned for the Urbanized Area Formula Program. After the one-half percent set-aside
($11,419,606), the amount appropriated under this program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$2,272,501,607. The funds to be reapportioned, described in the previous paragraph, were then added. Thus, the total
amount apportioned for this program is $2,296,852,993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data from the 1993 National Transit Database (Section 15) Report Year submitted in late 1993 and early 1994 have been
used to calculate the fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments for urbanized areas over 200,000 in
population. The population and population density figures used in calculating the Urbanized Area Formula are from
the 1990 Census.

C. Adjustments for Energy and Operating Efficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 U.S.C. 5336(b)(2) (formerly section 9(b)(4) of the FT Act) provides that, if a recipient under this section demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Secretary that energy or operating efficiencies would be achieved by actions that reduce
revenue vehicle miles but provide the same frequency of revenue service to the same number of riders, the recipient's
apportionment under 49 U.S.C. 5336 (formerly Section 9(b)(2)(A)) shall not be reduced as a result of such actions.
One recipient has submitted data acceptable to FTA in accordance with this provision. Accordingly, the revenue vehicle
miles used in the Urbanized Area Formula database to calculate the fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionment
reflect the amount the recipient would have received without the reductions in mileage.

D. Repayment of Temporary Matching Fund Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Temporary Matching Fund Waiver provision authorized at 49 U.S.C. 5307(i)(3) (formerly Section 9(g)(3)),
grantees have been able to request a Federal share of 100 percent up to the area's total apportionment. Four grants
or amendments have been awarded which employ the temporary waiver of local matching funds for Urbanized Area Formula
grants approved in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. The local share amounts for these grants had to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be repaid by March 30, 1994. If not repaid, the amount owed will be deducted from the area's fiscal years 1995 and 1996
Urbanized Area Formula apportionments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All affected grantees have opted to have their future apportionments reduced rather than pay back funds. Accordingly,
the FTA is reducing the areas' future apportionments to reflect the amount owed. The local share payment amount for
each project was determined by dividing the project's total disbursement amount through September 30, 1994, by the
project's total Federal capital obligations. The calculated percentage was then applied to the project's original
local share waived amount. Of the calculated amount determined for repayment, 50 percent has been deducted from the
fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionment. The remaining 50 percent will be deducted in fiscal year 1996.
The dollar amounts published in this Notice reflect these fiscal year 1995 adjustments, and the affected areas have
been so advised.

E. Urbanized Area Formula Fiscal Year 1995 Apportionments to Governors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total Urbanized Area Formula apportionment to the Governor for use in areas under 200,000 in population for each
State is shown on Table 2. Table 2 also contains the total apportionment amount attributable to each of the urbanized
areas within the State. The Governor may determine the allocation of funds among the urbanized areas under 200,000
in population with one exception. As further discussed below, funds attributed to an urbanized area under 200,000,
which is within the planning boundaries of a transportation management area, must be obligated in that area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Urbanized Area Formula Operating Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fiscal year 1995 limitations on the amount of Urbanized Area Formula funds that may be used for operating assistance
are included in Table 2 with the fiscal year 1995 apportionment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operating assistance limitations for all urbanized areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been increased under 49 U.S.C. 5336(d)(2) (formerly section 9(k)(2)(B) of the FT Act) to reflect the increase
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers during the most recent calendar years. The CPI Detailed Report,
December 1993, published by the Department of Labor (DOL), indicates the calendar year 1993 CPI increase for all urban
consumers is 2.7 percent. This increase was applied against the base operating assistance limitation calculated
under 49 U.S.C. 5336(d)(2) (formerly section 9(k)(2)(A) of the FT Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This increase results in an overall national fiscal year 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized operating assistance limitation level of $1,083,663,529. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act limits the nationwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability for operating assistance to a maximum of $710,000,000. Accordingly, the operating assistance limitation
published in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice takes into account both the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal transit laws. Therefore, the higher operating assistance limitation under Federal transit laws ($1,083,663,529)
has been reduced to the $710,000,000 required by the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act by taking a pro rata reduction across
all categories of grantees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 U.S.C. 5307(a)(2) (formerly section 9(m)(1) of the FT Act) specifies that in any case in which a statewide agency
or instrumentality is responsible under State laws for the financing, construction and operation, directly, by
lease, contract or otherwise, of public transportation services, and when such statewide agency or instrumentality
is the designated recipient of FTA funds, and when the statewide agency or instrumentality provides service among
two or more urbanized areas, the statewide agency or instrumentality shall be allowed to apply for operating assistance
up to the combined total permissible amount of all urbanized areas in which it provides service, regardless of whether
the amount for any particular urbanized area is exceeded.

H. Designated Transportation Management Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All urbanized areas over 200,000 in population have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as transportation management areas (TMAs), in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 49 U.S.C. 5305 (formerly section 8(i)(1) of the FT Act). These designations were formally made in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice dated May 18, 1992 (57 FR 21160), signed by the Federal Highway Administrator and the Federal Transit Administrator.
Additional areas may be designated as TMAs upon the request of the Governor and the MPO designated for such area or the
affected local officials. As of October 1, 1994, two additional TMAs have been formally designated: Petersburg,
Virginia, comprised solely of the Petersburg, Virginia, urbanized area; and Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and Lompoc,
California, which were designated as one TMA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance for setting the boundaries of TMAs is contained in the joint transportation planning regulations published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 28, 1993 (58 FR 58040). In some cases, the TMA boundaries which have been established by the MPO for the designated
TMA also include one or more urbanized areas under 200,000 in population. Where this situation exists, the discretion
of the Governor to allocate urbanized area formula program ``Governor's Apportionment'' funds for urbanized areas
under 200,000 in population is restricted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 U.S.C. 5307(a)(2) was modified by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) to require
that a recipient(s) be designated to dispense the Urbanized Area Formula funds attributable to TMAs. Those areas
that do not already have a designated recipient must name one and notify the appropriate FTA regional office of the
designation. This would include those urbanized areas under 200,000 in population that may receive TMA designation
independently, or those under 200,000 in population which are currently included within the boundaries of a larger
designated TMA. In both cases, the Governor would only have discretion to allocate Governor's Apportionment funds
attributable to areas which are outside of designated TMA boundaries. In order for the FTA and Governors to know which
urbanized areas under 200,000 in population are included within the boundaries of an existing TMA, and so that they
can be identified in future 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, each MPO whose TMA planning boundaries include these smaller urbanized areas is asked to identify such areas
to the FTA. This notification should be made in writing to the Associate Administrator for Grants Management, Federal
Transit Administration, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590, no later than July 1 of each fiscal year. In fiscal
year 1994, MPOs notified FTA that the following urbanized areas under 200,000 in population are included within the
planning boundary of a designated TMA:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Urbanized Area Formula funds apportioned to a TMA which cannot be used for the payment of operating expenses (i.e.,
capital funds) are also available for highway projects if the following three conditions are met: (1) Such use must
be approved by the MPO after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment and appeal are provided to affected transit
providers; (2) in the determination of the Secretary, such funds are not needed for investments required by the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990; and (3) funds may be available for highway projects under title 23, U.S.C., only if funds
used for the State or local share of such highway projects are eligible to fund either highway or transit projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Urbanized Area Formula funds which are designated for highway projects will be transferred to and administered by
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The MPO should notify FTA of their intent to program FTA funds for highway
purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fiscal year 1995 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionments total $132,752,946. The State apportionments are
displayed on Table 3. A total of $132,926,631 is appropriated for the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program. After the
one-half percent set-aside ($664,633), the fiscal year 1995 apportionment also includes $490,948 in prior year
deobligated funds which have become available for reapportionment under this program. These funds provide capital,
operating and administrative assistance for areas less than 50,000 in population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State must spend no less than 15 percent of its fiscal year 1995 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionment for the
development and support of intercity bus transportation, unless the Governor certifies to the Secretary that the
intercity bus service needs of the State are being adequately met. Fiscal year 1995 Nonurbanized Area Formula grant
applications must reflect this level of programming for intercity bus or include a certification from the Governor.
The population figures used in calculating these apportionments are from the 1990 Census.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of $59,152,156 is apportioned to the States for fiscal year 1995 under the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities
Program. Table 4 shows each State's apportionment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula for apportioning these funds uses 1990 Census 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population data for persons aged sixty-five and over and for persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The funds provide capital assistance for transportation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elderly persons and persons with disabilities. Eligible capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses may include, at the option of the recipient, the acquisition of transportation services under a contract,
lease, or other arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the assistance is intended primarily for private non-profit organizations, public bodies that coordinate
services for the elderly and persons with disabilities, or any public body that certifies to the State that non-profit
organizations in the area are not readily available to carry out the service, may receive these funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These program funds may be transferred by the Governor to supplement the Urbanized Area Formula or Nonurbanized Area
Formula capital funds during the last 90 days of the fiscal year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of $48,030,000 is appropriated for the Interstate Substitute Transit Program. Of that amount, $9,500,000
is earmarked for a substitute transit project in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The balance of $38,530,000 is appropriated
for other transit projects which have been substituted for withdrawn interstate highway segments. The funds are
apportioned by formula which reflects the remaining costs to complete each withdrawal area's substitute transit
projects. After the one-half percent set-aside ($192,585), $38,337,415 of the $38,530,000 remains for projects.
This completes the funding for the Interstate Substitute Transit Program for these withdrawal areas. Table 5 displays
the apportionment of these funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the funds directly appropriated for Interstate Substitute Transit projects, Substitute Highway
funds apportioned to a withdrawal area may be transferred from FHWA to FTA to be used for transit projects.

A. Transfer Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Flexible'' DOT funds, such as Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
(CMAQ) funds, or others, which are designated for use on transit projects, are transferred from the FHWA to FTA for
project approval. Flexible funds programmed for transit projects must result from the local and state planning and
programming process, and must be contained in an approved State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) before
the funds can be transferred. In order to initiate the transfer process, the grantee must submit a completed application
to the FTA Regional Office, and must notify the state highway/transportation agency that it has submitted an application
which requires a transfer of funds. Once the state highway/transportation agency determines that the state has sufficient
obligation authority, it must notify FHWA that the funds are to be used for transit purposes and request that they be
obligated by FHWA as a transfer project to FTA. The flexible funds transferred to FTA will be placed in an urbanized
area or state account under one of the three existing formula programs_Urbanized Area, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities,
or Nonurbanized Area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They are then treated as FTA formula funds, although they will retain a special identifying code. The flexible funds
may be used for any non-operating purpose eligible under these FTA programs. All FTA requirements are applicable
to transferred funds. Flexible funds should be combined with regular FTA formula funds in a single annual grant application.

B. Matching Share for Flexible Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of Title 23, U.S.C. regarding the non-Federal share apply to Title 23 funds used for transit projects.
Thus, flexible funds transferred to FTA retain the same matching share that such funds would have if used for highway
purposes and administered by the FHWA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are three instances in which a higher than 80 percent Federal share would be maintained. First, in States with
large areas of Indian and certain public domain lands, and National Forests, parks and monuments, the local share
for highway projects is determined by a sliding scale rate, calculated based on the percentage of public lands within
that state. This sliding scale, which permits a greater Federal share, but not to exceed 95 percent, is applicable
to transit projects funded with flexible funds in these public land states. FHWA develops the sliding scale matching
ratios for the increased Federal share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, commuter carpooling and vanpooling projects and transit safety projects using flexible funds administered
by FTA may retain the same 100 percent Federal share that would be allowed for ride-sharing or safety projects administered
by the FHWA. The 100 percent safety projects are subject to a nationwide ten percent program limitation.

C. Other Funds Transferred to FTA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain demonstration projects authorized under Title 23 are specified to be used for transit projects and are more
appropriately administered by FTA. In such cases, FHWA has transferred the funds to FTA for administration. Since
these funds are not STP flexible funds, they are transferred into the appropriate Capital Program category (Bus,
New Starts, or Fixed Guideway Modernization) for obligation and are administered as Capital projects.

A. Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fixed Guideway Modernization funds are allocated by formula. Statutory percentages were established to allocate
the first $497,700,000 to 11 fixed guideway areas. The next $70,000,000 is allocated one-half to these 11 urbanized
areas and one-half to other urbanized areas with fixed guideways which are at least seven years old on the basis of the
Urbanized Area Formula Program fixed guideway tier formula factors. The remaining funds are allocated to all of these
urbanized areas as one universe. For fiscal year 1995, $725,000,000 was appropriated for fixed guideway modernization.
After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($5,437,500), $719,562,500 is available for apportionment to the specified
urbanized areas for Fixed Guideway Modernization funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 6 displays these apportionments. Fixed Guideway Modernization funds apportioned under this section must
be used for capital projects to modernize or improve fixed guideway systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All urbanized areas with fixed guideway systems which are at least seven years old are eligible to receive Fixed Guideway
Modernization funds. A request for the start-up service dates for fixed guideways has been incorporated into the
Section 15 data reporting system to ensure that all eligible fixed guideway data is included in the calculation of
these apportionments. A threshold level of more than one mile of fixed guideway is required to receive Fixed Guideway
Modernization funds. Therefore, urbanized areas reporting less than one mile of fixed guideway mileage under Section
15 are not included.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fiscal year 1995 appropriation for New Starts is $646,670,000. These funds are entirely earmarked for projects
specified within the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act. After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($4,850,025), $641,819,975
remains available for allocation to areas. Table 7 displays the allocations by area and also shows prior year unobligated
earmarks for New Starts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fiscal year 1995 appropriation for Bus is $353,330,000 for the purchase of buses, bus-related equipment and paratransit
vehicles, and for the construction of bus-related facilities. After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($2,649,975)
for project management oversight, $350,680,025 remains available for projects. The ISTEA earmarked $12,000,000
in Bus funding for two bus projects in fiscal year 1995. The Conference Report accompanying the 1995 DOT Appropriations
Act earmarked an additional $316,330,000 to specified states or localities for bus and bus-related capital projects.
FTA administrative commitment of fiscal year 1995 funds to one full funding grant agreement totals $1,700,000. Thus,
$20,650,025 remains available for discretionary allocation by the Federal Transit Administrator. Table 8 displays
the allocations of earmarked fiscal year 1995 Bus funds by area and also shows prior year unobligated earmarks for
the Bus Program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fiscal year 1995 Metropolitan Planning apportionments to States for MPOs to be used in urbanized areas total $41,512,500.
A basic allocation of 80 percent of this amount ($33,210,000) is distributed to the States based on urbanized area
population for State distribution to each urbanized area, or parts thereof, within each State. A supplemental allocation
of the remaining 20 percent ($8,302,500) is also provided to the States based on an FTA administrative formula to address
planning needs in the larger, more complex urbanized areas. Table 9 contains the final State apportionments for the
combined basic and supplemental allocations. Each State, in cooperation with the MPOs, must develop an allocation
formula for the combined apportionment which distributes these funds to MPOs representing urbanized areas, or parts
thereof, within the State. This formula, which must be approved by the FTA, must ensure to the maximum extent practicable
that no MPO is allocated less than the amount it received by administrative formula under the Metropolitan Planning
Program in fiscal year 1991 (minimum MPO allocation). Each State formula must include a provision for the minimum
MPO allocation. Where the State and MPOs desire to use a new formula not previously approved by FTA, it must be submitted
to FTA for prior approval.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fiscal year 1995 apportionments for the State Planning and Research Program total $8,475,000. Final State apportionments
for this program are also contained on Table 9. This is the fourth year of a consolidated program which is apportioned
to the States for the purpose of such activities as planning, technical studies and assistance, demonstrations,
management training, and cooperative research. In addition, a State may authorize a portion of these funds to be used
to supplement planning funds allocated by the State to its urbanized areas, as the respective State deems appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Population data from the 1990 Census is used in calculating these apportionments. The Metropolitan Planning funding
provided to urbanized areas in each State by administrative formula in fiscal year 1991 was used as a ``hold harmless''
base in calculating funding to each State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that while the fiscal year 1995 apportionment amount remains unchanged from the fiscal year 1994 apportionment,
an adjustment has been made to more accurately reflect the distribution of population within a particular bi-state
urbanized area. This adjustment may result in a slight change to each State's individual apportionment from the fiscal
year 1994 amount.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funds apportioned under the Urbanized Area Formula Program, Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula, Metropolitan
Planning and State Planning and Research Programs in this Notice will remain available to be obligated by FTA to recipients
for three (3) fiscal years following fiscal year 1995. Any of these apportioned funds unobligated at the close of business
on September 30, 1998, will revert to FTA for reapportionment under these respective programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds apportioned to nonurbanized areas under the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, including RTAP funds, will
remain available for two (2) fiscal years following fiscal year 1995. Any such funds remaining unobligated at the
close of business on September 30, 1997, will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the States. Funds allocated
to States under the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program in this Notice must be obligated by September 30,
1995. Any such funds remaining unobligated as of this date will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the States.
Fiscal year 1995 Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit funds are available until expended. The 1995 DOT Appropriations
Act includes a provision requiring that fiscal year 1995 New Starts and Bus funds not obligated for their original
purpose as of September 30, 1997, shall be made available for other discretionary projects. A similar provision in
the 1994 DOT Appropriations Act required that fiscal year 1994 and prior year Bus and New Start funds that are not obligated
by September 30, 1996, shall also be made available for other discretionary projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FTA is engaged in an ongoing effort to streamline and simplify the administration of its programs. To this end, the
agency has expanded the authority extended to grantees to incur costs for operating assistance projects prior to
grant award to cover planning and capital costs as well. In fiscal year 1994 FTA extended this authority to non-operating
projects funded with current year apportioned formula funds. This automatic pre-award spending authority permitted
a grantee to incur costs on an eligible transit capital or planning project without prejudice to possible future Federal
participation in the cost of the project or projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Expanded Coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this provision has worked so well to reduce the paperwork burden on both the grantee and FTA regional offices,
effective as of October 1, 1994, the FTA is further broadening this authority. Authority to incur costs for Fixed Guideway
Modernization Formula, Metropolitan Planning, Urbanized Area Formula, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities,
Nonurbanized Area Formula, State Planning and Research, and Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit projects in
advance of possible future Federal participation is extended to apply to fiscal year 1995 FTA funds apportioned in
this Notice for the programs listed above, as well as funds to be apportioned in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Carryover
amounts for these programs are also included in this authority. This pre-award authority is also extended to projects
intended to be funded with STP or CMAQ funds transferred to FTA in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, provided that the projects
are contained in an approved STIP. The flexible funds would no longer have to be transferred to FTA before the authority
could be used. The two-year limit for these flexible funds corresponds to the more rigorous financial constraint
contained in the metropolitan planning regulation for non-attainment and maintenance areas. The authority does
not apply to New Starts or Bus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar to FTA's Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) authority, the conditions under which this authority may be utilized
are specified below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance
or that the FTA will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral commitment that all items undertaken
by the applicant will be eligible for inclusion in the project(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements must be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No action will be taken by the grantee which prejudices the legal and administrative findings which the Federal
Transit Administrator must make in order to approve a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the date of this authority will be eligible for credit
toward local match or reimbursement if the FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or project amendment(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee for the project will be determined on the basis of
the overall scope of activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the Federal-local match
ratio at the time the funds are obligated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For regular FTA formula funds to which this authority applies, the authority expires with the lapsing of fiscal
year 1997 funds. For flexible funds transferred from FHWA, the authority expires with the lapsing of fiscal year 1996
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Environmental and Other Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FTA emphasizes that all of the Federal grant requirements must be met for the project to remain eligible for Federal
funding. Some of these requirements must be met before pre-award costs are incurred, notably the requirements of
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws or executive orders
(e.g., protection of parklands, wetlands, historic properties) must be completed before state or local funds are
advanced for a project expected to be subsequently funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the project is included
under in FTA's environmental regulations (23 CFR 771) the grantee may not advance the project beyond planning and
preliminary engineering before FTA has approved either a categorical exclusion (refer to 23 CFR 771.117(d)), a finding
of no significant impact, or a final environmental impact statement. The conformity requirements of the Clean Air
Act (40 CFR 51) also must be fully met before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal requirements, must be followed
for projects in which Federal funding will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements could make
the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this increased administrative flexibility requires a grantee
to make certain that no Federal requirements are circumvented thereby. If a grantee has questions or concerns regarding
the environmental requirements, or any other Federal requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should
contact the appropriate regional office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before an applicant may incur costs either for activities expected to be funded by Bus or New Start funds, or for activities
requiring funding beyond fiscal year 1997, it must first obtain a written LONP from the FTA. To obtain an LONP, a grantee
must submit a written request accompanied by adequate information and justification to the appropriate FTA regional
office. FTA will consider the request in light of its ``Letter of No Prejudice Policy'' (47 FR 46956, October 21, 1982).

XIV. Electronic Grant Making and Management (EGMM) Initiative_Fiscal Year 1995 and Beyond
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the National Performance Review and the FTA strategic planning process, the FTA has two initiatives
designed to improve customer service and efficiency of program delivery: (1) On-Line Grantee Program_available
to all grantee agencies which can access the FTA Grants Management Information System (GMIS) mainframe computer
system via a toll free phone connection. This program was initially designed for ``inquiry only'' purposes. However,
this program will be expanded on a case-by-case basis to allow grantees to make annual certifications and assurances
through GMIS and conduct required quarterly financial status and narrative grant progress reporting. (2) Electronic
Grant Making and Management Pilot Program_participation in the fiscal year 1995 pilot program is limited to the 21
grantee agencies (including Greater Hartford Transit District, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority,
Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Baltimore
Mass Transit Administration, Lehigh and North Hampton Transit Authority, City of Montgomery Area Transit System,
Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Chicago Transit Authority, Central Ohio Transit Authority, Metropolitan
Transportation Authority of Harris County, New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, Bi-State Development
Agency_St. Louis, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, Montana Department of Transportation, Denver
Regional Transportation District, City and County of San Francisco_Public Utilities Commission, Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, King County Department of Metropolitan Services, Washington State Department
of Transportation, and National Easter Seal Society). During the pilot program (October 1, 1994 through September
30, 1995) these grantees will apply for and manage grants at their computer stations connected to the FTA GMIS computer
using a modem and toll free phone connection. The purpose of this initiative is to streamline the FTA grant making and
management process through a paperless electronic grant application, review, approval, acceptance and management
process. DOL has agreed to participate in the program and receive requests for Labor Protection Certification under
49 U.S.C. 5333(b) of projects as well as issue Labor Protection Certifications electronically for the EGMM Pilot
Program participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Quarterly evaluation will be conducted of both the On-Line Grantee Program and the EGMM Pilot Program. Also during
fiscal year 1995 FTA will implement the annual certifications and assurances for all grantees in which one signature
will replace the continued validity statement and separate certifications and assurances. All EGMM grantee participants
and On-Line Grantee participants on a case-by-case basis will be able to provide these certifications electronically.
In preparation of the EGMM initiative, FTA has already issued a Master Agreement that replaces Part I and portions
of Part II of the current FTA grant agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the completion of the EGMM Pilot Program of fiscal year 1995, FTA intends to expand the EGMM Program to include
additional grantee agencies during fiscal year 1996. FTA also has several activities under consideration to expand
the functional content of EGMM. The kinds of activities under consideration include a mechanism to facilitate electronic
statewide transportation improvement programs, electronic unified planning work programs, and an electronic
library. The FTA would like your comments and suggestions on additional areas FTA could facilitate electronic interface
to better serve our customers. Please write your regional office with your suggestions on the FTA EGMM Pilot Program
and On-Line Grantee Program.

XV. Quartley Approval of Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FTA has established a quarterly approval and release cycle for processing grants. All Urbanized Area Formula,
Nonurbanized Area Formula, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities, Capital, Metropolitan Planning, State Planning
and Research, and Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit grants are processed on a quarterly basis. This includes
Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area Formula, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities grants using STP or
CMAQ funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If completed applications are submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional Office no later than the first business day
of the quarter, FTA will award grants by the last business day of the quarter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to expedite the grant approval process within the quarterly approval structure, grants which are complete
and have received the required Labor Protection Certification may be approved before the end of the quarter. Applications
for the first quarter should be submitted to the FTA Regional Office within five business days of this Notice. The first-quarter
grants will be released on or before December 30, 1994. There are only two factors which would delay FTA's approval
of the project beyond the end of a quarter. First is a failure by DOL to issue a Labor Protection Certification where
such certification is a prerequisite to a grant approval, and second is the failure of FHWA to actually transfer flexible
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For an application to be considered complete, all required activities such as inclusion of the project in a locally
approved Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), a Federally approved State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP), intergovernmental reviews, environmental reviews, all applicable civil rights, anti-drug, and clean
air requirements, and submission of all requisite certifications and documentation must be completed. The application
must be in approvable form with all required documentation and submissions on hand, except for the Labor Protection
Certification which is issued by DOL. Incomplete applications will not be processed, but if the missing components
are supplied, will be considered in the next quarter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of FTA to expedite grant application reviews and speed program delivery by reducing the number of grant
applications. To this end, FTA strongly encourages grant applicants to submit only one application per fiscal year
for each formula program. The single application should contain the fiscal year's capital (including flexible funds),
planning and operating elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
XV. Grant Application Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications for FTA funds should be submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional Office. Formula grant applications
should be prepared in conformance with the following FTA Circulars: Urbanized Area Formula_C9030.1A, September
18, 1987; Nonurbanized Area Formula_C9040.1C, November 3, 1992; and Elderly and Persons with Disabilities_C9070.1C,
December 23, 1992. Applications for STP ``flexible'' fund grants should be prepared in the same manner as the apportioned
funds under the Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area Formula, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Programs.
Guidance on preparation of applications for Capital, Metropolitan Planning, State Planning and Research, and Title
23 funds may be obtained from each FTA Regional Office. Copies of circulars are also available from Regional Offices.

Formula Assistance Grants for Urbanized Areas; Grants for Training Programs; Formula Assistance Grants for Elderly
Individuals and Individuals With Disabilities; Formula Assistance Grants for Nonurbanized Areas; Human Resource
Grants; and Planning and Research Grants (formerly referenced as Sections 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11(a), 16, 18, 20, or 26 of
the Federal Transit Act, as amended, now codified at 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certifications and assurances are set forth as Appendix A in this Notice, which thus serves as a comprehensive
compilation of Federal certification and assurance requirements to date. This document will be re-published annually
with any changes or additions specifically highlighted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Notice also provides the grant applicant with a single Signature Page, allowing the grant applicant and its attorney
to certify compliance with all of the certifications and assurances pertinent to any and all grants for which the grant
applicant wishes to apply in fiscal year 1995, (see Appendix B.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FTA has introduced two new electronic programs for applicants. The On-Line Grantee Program is offered
to applicants through the Grant Management Information System (GMIS). This is a computerized system designed to
assist the grantee with the management of grant projects and budgets. All grant applicants are encouraged to participate
in the On-Line Grantee Program, which includes the opportunity to electronically certify compliance for all certifications
and assurances as shown in Appendix A. The Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative (EGMM) is a new pilot
program currently offered to selected grantees who will be able to actually apply for a grant electronically. Both
programs are designed to aid FTA grant applicants by reducing time and paper. Applicants are asked to contact their
Regional Office shown above for more information.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the past, applicants for FTA grants have submitted a variety of certifications and assurances with each application.
Subsequently, an applicant was required to reaffirm compliance with the earlier certifications and assurances
with a Statement of Continued Validity submitted with each application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the publication of this Notice, certifications and assurances for Federal mass transportation assistance
grants will for the first time be contained in one document. This marks the beginning of an effort to assist grant applicants
in reducing time and paper work in certifying compliance with various Federal laws and regulations. It coincides
with the pilot program for the Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative and the On-Line Grantee Program
described above, which will further reduce the time required to process a grant application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to keep an applicant well informed of its responsibility to meet the requirements of Federal transit laws,
and aware of changes, deletions or additions to those requirements, this compilation will be published annually
in conjunction with the publication of the agency's annual apportionment Notice, which allocates funds in accordance
with the latest annual appropriations act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This publication of certifications and assurances therefore supersedes the requirements of FTA Circular 9100.1B,
dated July 1, 1988, ``Standard Assurances for Urban Mass Transportation Administration Applications,'' which
is being rescinded. Other affected Circulars will be revised accordingly. This publication also supersedes the
requirement to submit the Statement of Continued Validity.

Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following this introductory material is a detailed compilation of Certifications and Assurances (Appendix A),
which is followed by a Signature Page (Appendix B.) The Signature Page is to be signed by the grant applicant and its
attorney and sent to the appropriate FTA Regional office by: (1) The first-quarter application submission date published
in the fiscal year apportionment announcement; or (2) with the first grant application of the 1995 fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Signature Page, when properly signed and submitted to the FTA, assures FTA the applicant intends to comply with
the requirements for the specific program involved. Both sides of the Signature Page must be completed, first by marking
where appropriate with an `X' on the category selection side, and then signifying compliance by signing the reverse
side (see Appendix B.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event the grant applicant is a participant in the Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative or the On-Line
Grantee Program described above, submission of the Signature Page may be done electronically. The applicant is advised
to consult with the appropriate Regional Office prior to submission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject
of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding
Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believes define Federal
policy on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. Docket No.
27782 (59 FR 29874, June 9, 1994). Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice
for Federally Assisted Airports,'' proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication
of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other
airport-related requirements (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August
23, 1994. The 1994 Authorization Act includes provisions that specifically address airport rates and charges. This
supplemental notice is intended to assure that the proposed policy statement reflects relevant provisions of the
1994 Authorization Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Proposed Policy Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed policy statement includes five principles with supporting guidance for each. In brief, the first principle
would establish the continued reliance on direct local negotiation between airports and aeronautical users. DOT/FAA
would be available to resolve the issues raised in a dispute when the airport and aeronautical users are unable to resolve
disputes directly.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second principle would restate the legal requirement that rates, fees and charges to aeronautical users must
be fair and reasonable, with more detailed guidance on the practices and restrictions that define ``fair and reasonable.''
Among other things, the DOT/FAA proposed to provide airport proprietors with some flexibility to deviate from the
proposed policy guidance based on agreement with aeronautical users. In addition, the proposed policy statement
would recognize the legitimacy of either the compensatory or residual pricing approach and of combinations of both.
DOT/FAA did not propose to establish standards for rates and charges for nonaeronautical users (nonaeronautical
rates and charges) nor to limit the amount of revenues generated by nonaeronautical rates and charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third principle would restate the legal prohibition on unjustly discriminatory rates and charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth principle would restate the legal obligation of the airport sponsor to maintain a fee and rental structure
that makes the airport as self-sustaining as possible. Supplemental guidance encouraged the sponsor of an airport
that is not currently self-sustaining to establish long-term goal and targets to make the airport financially self-sustaining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth principle would restate legal requirements for the application and use of airport revenues. Supplemental
guidance would advise that airport revenue generated by nonaeronautical sources is subject to the same statutory
requirements governing use as aeronautical revenue. In addition, supplemental guidance would provide that progressive
accumulation of substantial amounts of airport revenues may warrant an FAA inquiry into the airport proprietor's
application of revenues to the local airport system.

Summary of Applicable 1994 Authorization Act Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110 of the 1994 Authorization Act amends the statement of policy for airport improvement, 49 U.S.C. 47101,
by adding statements ``that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable'' and that ``in establishing new
fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek
to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for
which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other
funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113 of the 1994 Authorization Act adds a new section 47129 titled ``Resolution of airport-air carrier disputes
concerning airport fees.'' Section 47129 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to issue a determination
on the reasonableness of an airport rate or fee imposed on an air carrier if the airport owner requests a determination
or if a complaint is filed by an affected air carrier. Section 47129 further provides that a fee may be calculated pursuant
to either a compensatory or residual fee methodology or any combination thereof, and section 47129 specifically
prohibits the Secretary from setting the level of the fee. Section 47129 further directs the Secretary to issue within
90 days after enactment final regulations or policy statements establishing (1) administrative procedures for
processing cases under section 47129 and (2) standards or guidelines to be used in determining the reasonableness
of a fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112 of the Authorization Act strengthens existing requirements for the use of airport revenues by grant-obligated
airport sponsors. Section 112 of the Authorization Act amends 49 U.S.C. 47107 by adding a new subsection ``(l).''
Among other things, subsection (l) directs the Secretary to establish within 90 days after enactment policies and
procedures to assure prompt and effective enforcement of subsections (a)(13) and (b) of section 47107.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection 47107(a)(13) in turn requires an airport sponsor to give written assurances that it will maintain a schedule
of charges at the airport that will make the airport as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing
at the airport. Subsection 47107(b) requires the airport sponsor to give written assurances that revenue generated
by the airport will be used for the capital and operating costs of the obligated airport, the sponsor's local airport
system or other facilities owned or operated by the sponsor and directly and substantially related to the air transportation
of persons or property. Certain other uses of airport revenue mandated by statutes or assurances in debt obligations
in effect before September 2, 1982 are expressly excluded from this requirement. Uses of airport revenue not in accordance
with section 47107(b) are referred to as airport revenue diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New subsection 47107(l) further directs the Secretary to prohibit, at a minimum, four specific practices as diversion
of airport revenue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112 of the Authorization Act also amends 49 U.S.C. 47111 by adding new sanctions for airport revenue diversion.
As amended, section 47111 directs the Secretary to withhold approval of new grant applications for funds and to withhold
approval under 49 U.S.C. 40117 of any new passenger facility charge if the Secretary has found an airport sponsor to
be engaged in airport revenue diversion and the sponsor has failed to take appropriate corrective action. In addition
section 47111 authorizes the Secretary to seek judicial enforcement of all grant assurances made by a sponsor.

Modifications to Proposed Policy Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOT/FAA are making four modifications to the proposed policy statement in response to statutory direction. First,
the proposed supplemental guidance on the DOT/FAA role in resolving airport/aeronautical user disputes is being
modified to reflect the statutory directive to determine the reasonableness of fees charged to air carriers and foreign
air carriers when requested by the airport or upon complaint of a carrier, if a significant dispute exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, supplementary guidance on financial self-sufficiency is being modified to reflect the statutory directive
on this subject contained in section 112 of the 1994 Authorization Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the proposed supplemental guidance on the generation and use of airport revenue is being modified to incorporate
the new statutory policy guidance added by section 110 of the 1994 Authorization Act. As noted, section 110 provides
that ``in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and
operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes.
*&blank;*&blank;*.'' Section 110 is being implemented in this way, rather than through the guidance on fair and reasonable
rates, because the DOT/FAA do not consider section 110 to require the regulation of the level of total airport revenue
or to establish a standard for reasonableness for nonaeronautical rates and charges under the grant assurances.
This conclusion is based on a number of considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the 1994 Authorization Act explicitly authorizes compensatory as well as residual pricing arrangements.
Under the compensatory system, air carrier user charges are based on costs of serving air carriers without regard
to the profit or loss generated by other users of the airport. To construe the reasonableness requirement of the statute
as creating a legally enforceable right to limit the amount of nonaeronautical generated revenue would be inconsistent
with the express authorization of compensatory pricing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, Congress included the language in question as an amendment to 49 U.S.C. 47101, which is a statement of
the policy of the United States. Congress chose not to include the provision as an amendment to 49 U.S.C. 47107, which
specifies practices that airport proprietors must agree to as a condition for receipt of grants. In addition, section
110 of the 1994 Authorization Act stands in marked contrast to sections 112 and 113 of the 1994 Authorization Act, in
which Congress directed the Secretary to develop policies and procedures to address the reasonableness of rates
and charges imposed on airlines and to define airport revenue diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, nowhere in the 1994 Authorization Act is the Secretary explicitly directed to establish standards
of reasonableness for nonaeronautical rates and charges or total airport revenue. At the time of enactment, however,
the DOT/FAA had already published its proposed policy, and that policy would not have applied to nonaeronautical
rates and charges. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that Congress would have included clear and
explicit direction to the Secretary to establish standards of reasonableness for nonaeronautical rates and charges
just as it did for carrier rates and charges in section 112 had Congress intended to mandate such a result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, DOT/FAA have considered the legislative history of this provision. The Conferees described section 110
of the Authorization Act as ``[r]eaching a middle ground on this aspect of airport finances *&blank;*&blank;*''
H.R. Rep. 103&hyph;677 at 68 (August 5, 1994). DOT/FAA consider our approach to be more in keeping with this view of
section 110 than would an approach that treated section 110 as mandating a cap on total airport revenue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110 and the modifications to the proposed policy encouraged airport proprietors not to ``seek to create revenue
surpluses'' in excess of airport needs. The DOT/FAA recognize that in any given year, surpluses may exceed projections
if traffic exceeds forecast levels or costs are held below forecast amounts. The existence of a surplus in any given
year is not necessarily evidence that an airport proprietor is not following this policy guidance. However, as is
provided in the proposed policy statement, the progressive accumulation of substantial amounts of airport revenues
may warrant an FAA inquiry into the airport proprietor's application of revenues to the local airport system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fourth modification, new supplemental guidance on generation and use of airport revenue, is being proposed to
reflect the statutory mandate of section 112 of the Authorization Act to define certain practices as impermissible
revenue diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While DOT/FAA consider these changes to the guidance on generation and use of airport revenue to be consistent with
section 112 of the 1994 Authorization Act, they are not intended to be the sole response to section 112. Additional
policy guidance or regulations implementing section 112 will be published.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the mandate of 1994 Authorization Act to adopt procedural regulations is being addressed in separate rulemaking
proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, DOT/FAA revise the proposal published at 59 FR 29874 as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 are deleted and the following paragraphs are proposed instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``1.2.1 In the case of rates, charges and fees imposed on one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers, DOT will issue
a determination on the reasonableness of the rate or charge upon the filing of a written request for a determination
by the airport proprietor or the filing of a complaint by one or more air carriers, if DOT determines that a significant
dispute exists, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 47129, and implementing regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2.2 In the case of rates, charges or fees imposed on other aeronautical users, DOD/FAA will first offer its good offices
to facilitate parties' reaching a successful outcome in a timely manner. Prompt resolution of these disputes is always
desirable since extensive delay can lead to uncertainty for the public and a hardening of the parties' positions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2.3. In the case of rates, charges or fees imposed on other aeronautical users, where negotiations between the parties
are unsuccessful and a complaint is filed alleging that airport rates and charges violate an airport proprietor's
federal grant obligations, DOT/FAA will, where warranted, exercise the broad statutory authority to investigate
and review the legality of those rates and charges and to issue such determinations and take such actions as are appropriate
based on that review. DOT/FAA will remain available to assist in the negotiated resolution of a dispute even after
the filing of a complaint.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A new paragraph 4.1.1 as set forth below is added to the proposed policy statement:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``4.1.1 Airport proprietors are encouraged, when entering into new or revised agreements or otherwise establishing
rates, charges, and fees, to undertake reasonable efforts to make their particular airports as self-sustaining
as possible in the circumstances existing at such airports.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A new paragraph 5.2 as set forth below is added to the proposed policy statement. The current paragraph 5.2 is renumbered
as paragraph 5.2.1, and paragraph 5.3 is renumbered as paragraph 5.2.2. Paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5 are renumbered as paragraphs
5.3 and 5.4, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``5.2 In establishing new fees, rates and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators
should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other
purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under 49 U.S.C. 47107(b)(1), including reasonable reserves and
other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A new paragraph 5.6, as set forth below, is added to the proposed policy statement:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``5.6 Subject to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 47107(b)(2), the DOT/FAA consider the following practices to be impermissible
uses of airport revenue:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Direct payments or indirect payments, other than payments reflecting the value of services and facilities provided
to the airport;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Use of airport revenues for general economic development, marketing, and promotional activities unrelated
to airports or airport systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payments in lieu of taxes or other assessments that exceed the value of services provided; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Payments to compensate nonsponsoring governmental bodies for lost tax revenues exceeding stated tax rates.''
