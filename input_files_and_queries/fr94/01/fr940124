SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of the Interior is announcing the approval, with certain exceptions, of proposed amendments to the
Wyoming permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), and the corresponding modification of the one remaining condition
of program approval. The amendments primarily address the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred in connection with administrative review proceedings under the Wyoming program, but they also include
provisions pertaining to formal and informal administrative reviews in general, intervention in administrative
review proceedings, and the definition of toxic materials. The amendments are intended to revise the Wyoming program
to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards and to clarify State operating procedures.

I. Background on the Wyoming Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background
information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions
of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980,

 (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11,
950.12, 950.15, and 950.16.

II. Submission of Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 9, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;22&hyph;1), Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment comprised
of (1) Enrolled Act No. 60 (1993 General Session), which, as signed into law on March 2, 1993, revised subsection (f)
of section 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 of the Wyoming Statutes (W.S.) and added a new subsection (g) to this section, and
(2) a number of changes to Chapter V of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality (DEQ). Both Enrolled Act No. 60 and the regulation changes pertain solely to the award of costs and expenses
in connection with administrative and judicial proceedings under the approved State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State submitted the amendment primarily to satisfy a condition the Secretary placed on the approval of the Wyoming
program at 30 CFR 950.11(c) (hereinafter, condition ``c''). This condition requires the State to amend its program
to include provisions that are consistent with the Federal regulations at 43 CFR part 4 concerning intervention in
administrative review proceedings and the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred
in connection with participation in such proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming originally promulgated Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure on August 3, 1982, and submitted
it to OSM as a program amendment by letter dated August 18, 1982. This amendment also included a revised version of section
7 of Chapter II of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure; the revisions of this chapter were intended to satisfy the
intervention portion of condition ``c.'' Wyoming had previously promulgated these rules in identical form as temporary
emergency regulations, which were submitted to OSM on May 26, 1982. After reviewing the emergency regulations, OSM
determined that they did not fully satisfy condition ``c.'' Therefore, instead of acting upon these portions of the
May 26, 1982, proposed amendment, OSM extended the deadline for Wyoming to meet the condition (47 FR 42351&hyph;52,
September 27, 1982). Similarly, OSM never acted upon the corresponding portions of the August 18, 1982, submittal,
which were identical to the May 26, 1982, submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The August 18, 1982, submittal also included (1) a revised definition of ``toxic materials'' at Chapter I, section
2(99) of the Rules and Regulations of DEQ's Land Quality Division (LQD), and (2) a new Chapter VI to be added to the DEQ
Rules of Practice and Procedure. The new chapter authorizes the Director of the DEQ to informally review and modify
decisions of division administrators (including the Administrator of the LQD) and establishes procedures and requirements
governing such reviews. OSM also did not act upon these portions of the proposed amendment at the time of submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the March 9, 1993, submittal revises part of the August 18, 1982, submittal, OSM is taking this opportunity
to announce a decision on both submittals. Except for recodification of the definition of toxic materials, no changes
other than those contained in the March 9, 1993, submittal have been made in the regulations submitted on August 18,
1982. (See letter from Wyoming dated August 27, 1992 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;22&hyph;2).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the March 9, 1993, submittal in the March 30, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 16637), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the substantive adequacy of both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals. The public comment period
closed on April 29, 1993. A public hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Secretary's findings
concerning the proposed amendments submitted by Wyoming on August 18, 1982, and March 9, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Award of Costs and Expenses: General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 525(e) of SMCRA provides that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever an order is issued under this section, or as a result of any administrative proceeding under this Act, at the
request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney fees) as determined
by the Secretary to have been reasonably incurred by such person for or in connection with his participation in such
proceedings, including any judicial review of agency actions, may be assessed against either party as the court,
resulting from judicial review, or the Secretary, resulting from administrative proceedings, deems proper.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 525(e) is not directly applicable to State programs, section 102(i) of SMCRA specifies that one
of the purposes of the Act is to ``assure that appropriate procedures are provided for the public participation in
the development, revision, and enforcement of regulations, standards, reclamation plans, or programs established
by the Secretary or any State under this Act.'' To implement this provision, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10)
require that State programs ``[p]rovide for public participation in the development, revision and enforcement
of State regulations and the State program, consistent with public participation requirements of the Act and this
chapter.'' Furthermore, 30 CFR 732.15(b)(14) requires that State programs ``[p]rovide for administrative review
of State program actions, in accordance with section 525 of the Act and subchapter L of this chapter,'' and 30 CFR 840.15
specifies that ``[e]ach State program shall provide for public participation in enforcement of the State program
consistent with that provided by 30 CFR parts 842, 843 and 845 and 43 CFR part 4.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preambles to both 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10) and 840.15 explain that these rules mean that the State program must authorize
the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative and judicial proceedings as provided
under sections 520 (d) and (f) and 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR part 4 (44 FR 14965, 15297, March 13, 1979). In 1981 and 1982,
OSM considered revising these two rules to modify this interpretation, but, ultimately, no changes were adopted
(47 FR 26359&hyph;60, June 17, 1982; 47 FR 35625, August 16, 1982). Therefore, the 1979 preamble is still an authoritative
explanation of the Federal regulations currently in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;902(e) and 35&hyph;11&hyph;901(p), the Wyoming program counterparts to paragraphs (d)
and (f), respectively, of section 520 of SMCRA, are unaffected by the amendments under consideration in this rulemaking.
These provisions, which authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with citizen suits to compel
compliance with regulatory requirements or to recover damages for personal injury or property damage sustained
as a result of a violation, are substantively identical to and consistent with their Federal counterparts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60, as submitted on March 9, 1993, extensively revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f),
the Wyoming counterpart to section 525(e) of SMCRA, which authorizes the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection
with administrative proceedings and judicial review of agency actions. Enrolled Act No. 60 also adds W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g),
which further restricts awards of costs and expenses under subsection (f). As discussed below in this finding and
in findings 3, 5, 6, and 7, the Secretary has determined that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 (f) and (g) are not fully consistent
with section 525(e) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations implementing that provision of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure is the Wyoming counterpart to the Federal rules at 43 CFR 4.1290
through 4.1296, which implement section 525(e) of SMCRA with respect to awards of costs and expenses incurred in connection
with administrative review proceedings. Except as discussed below in this finding, these State rules, as submitted
on August 18, 1982, and revised by submittal dated March 9, 1993, are substantively identical to the Federal rules.
Finding 2 explains why Wyoming's use of the term ``contested case'' is not a substantive difference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wyoming rules do not include a counterpart to either 43 CFR 4.1296, which provides that an administrative law judge's
decision on a petition for an award of costs and expenses may be appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals, or that
portion of 43 CFR 4.1291 that specifies where a petition for an award of costs and expenses must be filed. However, unlike
the two-tiered Federal administrative review system, Wyoming has only one administrative review entity, the Environmental
quality Council (EQC or the Council). Therefore, neither of these provisions is needed since (1) there is no question
as to the entity with which the petition must be filed, and (2) no administrative review of an EQC decision is possible
because no higher-level administrative review entity exists. Furthermore, both Sections 2 and 3.a.(2) of Chapter
V clearly identify the Council as the entity responsible for the processing of petitions for the award of costs and
expenses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the statute is inconsistent with the regulations in that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) vets the Director
of the DEQ with the responsibility for processing petitions and determining awards, whereas Chapter V of the DEQ Rules
of Practice and Procedure assigns this responsibility to the Council. Since 43 CFR 4.1291 requires that petitions
be filed with and processed by the administrative review entity that decided the underlying case, the Secretary finds
that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with the Federal regulations to the extent that it assigns this
responsibility to the Director of the DEQ, who has no formal administrative review function, rather than the Council.
Therefore, the Secretary is not approving the phrases ``by the director'' and ``as the court or the director deems
proper'' in the first sentence of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f). Nothing in these actions shall be construed as eliminating
the ``deems proper'' standard of review or as vesting the Council with the authority to review or decide petitions
for the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with judicial proceedings. The Secretary is disapproving
the entire phrase ``as the court or the director deems proper'' to avoid creating a situation in which only the court
would have the authority to assess awards under the Wyoming statute, as could be the case if only the clause ``or the
director'' within that phrase was disapproved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wyoming rules also lack a counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2), which allows an award of costs and expenses to any
person from the permitte if the person initiates an application for review of alleged discriminatory acts pursuant
to 30 CFR part 830 (since recodified as 30 CFR part 865) upon a finding of discriminatory discharge or other acts of discrimination.
However, nothing in SMCRA or the Federal regulations requires that State programs include a counterpart to section
703 of the Act or its implementing regulations at 30 CFR part 865. Any person who believes they have been discriminated
against in violation of this section of the Act has the right to file an application for review directly with OSM in accordance
with 30 CFR part 865. Any resulting hearings would be held by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of
the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR part 4 and the applicant would have the right to file a petition for an award of
costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, as submitted on August 18,
1982, and revised on March 9, 1993, is not inconsistent with the Federal requirements concerning the award of costs
and expenses incurred in connection with administrative proceedings, as set forth in section 525(e) of SMCRA and
43 CFR part 4. Accordingly, the Secretary is approving these State rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Award of Costs and Expenses: Contested Case Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming has revised both W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) and Section 2.a.(3) of Chapter V of DEQ's Rules of Practice
and Procedure to provide that participants in administrative proceedings may recover costs and expenses only if
the proceeding is a ``contested case'' proceeding, although the regulations use this language only in connection
with awards from the State, not awards from other parties. Section 525(e) of SMCRA provides for the award of costs and
expenses incurred in connection with ``any administrative proceeding.'' Prior to the State's adoption of the amendment
under consideration in this rulemaking, W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) contained similar language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although neither the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act (EQA) nor the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure directly
define ``contested case,'' Chapter I, Section 2.a. of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure indicates that all definitions
contained in the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, which does define this term, are incorporated by reference.
However, Sections 1 and 2.a.(4) of Chapter I of the DEQ Rules define the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act as W.S.
9&hyph;4&hyph;101 through 9&hyph;4&hyph;115. These citations appear to be in error since Title 9 of the Wyoming
Statutes does not pertain to administrative review of agency actions. The correct citation appears to be W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101
through 16&hyph;3&hyph;115, which W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101 (a) and (b)(xi) identify as the Wyoming Administrative
Procedure Act. The Secretary encourages Wyoming to correct this citation error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101(b)(ii) defines ``contested case'' as ''a proceeding including but not restricted to ratemaking,
price fixing and licensing, in which legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by law to be determined
by an agency after an opportunity for hearing but excludes designations under W.S. 9&hyph;2&hyph;1022(h)(i).''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has not clearly indicated how this definition would translate in practice to actions and proceedings under
the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act and its implementing regulations. However, in an October 29, 1992, document
entitled ``Statement of Principal Reasons for Adoption'' that accompanied the revised rules, the Council stated
that ``the words `contested case' were added before the word `proceeding' *&blank;*&blank;* to clarify that fees
may be awarded only in contested cases, as opposed to rulemaking hearings.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or the Board) and the U.S. District Court for the Utah District declined
to delineate the full reach of the phrase ``any administrative proceeding'' in section 525(e) of SMCRA when presented
with an opportunity to do so.

 643 F. Supp. 810, 825 n. 26 (D. Utah 1986). However, in deciding these cases, both the IBLA and the U.S. District Court
held that this phrase should not be read literally, but rather must be interpreted in the context of the legislative
history of SMCRA and case law concerning attorney fee and expense awards under other statutes. Both opinions contain
extensive dicta suggesting that the phrase could or should be read to include only administrative proceedings of
an adjudicatory nature, not proceedings that are part of the fact-finding process culminating in an initial agency
decision, e.g., informal conferences on permit applications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1290 and 4.1291, which implement this section of SMCRA in part, provide
for an award of costs and expenses only in connection with administrative proceedings resulting in the issuance of
a final order by an administrative law judge or the IBLA. The preamble to these regulations notes that the Secretary
rejected comments requesting that the scope of the rules be expanded to allow the award of costs and expenses in other
types of administrative proceedings, such as rulemaking (43 FR 34385, August 3, 1978). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that the Wyoming statutory and regulatory provisions allowing the award of costs
and expenses only in connection with a ``contested case'' proceeding are not inconsistent with section 525(e) of
SMCRA and its implementing regulations, as interpreted by case law. However, the Secretary's approval is predicated
upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term ``contested case'' to include all classes of actions in which participants
would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295, consistent with the discussion
set forth above. At a minimum, the term must include all administrative proceedings of an adjudicatory nature. Additionally,
as more case law develops, it may be necessary to further expand the interpretation to include other types of administrative
proceedings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to provide that a participant in a proceeding is
eligible to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if the issues resolved in the contested proceeding
were raised in the original complaint and within the statutory timeframes of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within
an enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 525(e) of SMCRA does not provide a basis for a limitation of this nature. The purpose of section 525(e) is to
facilitate public participation in the administrative and judicial review process, as required by section 102(i)
of the Act. As stated in the preamble to 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295 as originally proposed:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of the Act is clear that section 525(e) of the Act is intended to encourage public participation
in the administrative process. Such a provision is designed to encourage citizens to bring good faith actions to insure
that the Act is being properly enforced. It is the intention of the Office that these proposed rules not be interpreted
to discourage good faith actions on the part of interested citizens.

Administrative and judicial review entities may not be obligated to accept untimely filings or amended complaints,
but if they do there is no basis for excluding participants in the affected proceeding from eligibility for an award
of costs and expenses. Such persons are entitled to all the rights and privileges accorded to other litigants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, restricting awards under W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to issues ``raised within the statutory time
frames of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within an enforcement action'' would improperly limit the type of proceedings
for which an award may be made. As previously noted, section 525(e) of SMCRA allows awards in connection with ``any
administrative proceeding under this Act.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the meaning of the new State statutory language is unclear since W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) does
not establish timeframes for appealing agency actions. Instead, it merely specifies the time within which the regulatory
authority must render a decision on a permit application. To be consistent with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NRDC, supra,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which the IBLA found the plaintiffs eligible for an award of costs and expenses pursuant to section 525(e) of SMCRA
as a result of their participation in an administrative appeal of a decision on a permit application, Wyoming must
likewise authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative review of regulatory
authority decisions on permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if the State language were to be interpreted as including permit application decisions, restricting award eligibility
to proceedings involving either enforcement actions or decisions on permit applications is inconsistent with Utah
International, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the opinion accompanying the Utah International decision contains numerous statements that section 525(e)
does not apply to nonenforcement administrative proceedings, the court ultimately awarded attorney fees to the
plaintiffs in this case as a result of their participation in judicial proceedings concerning a designation of certain
lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations. Decisions on petitions to designate lands as unsuitable
for mining are not enforcement actions or proceedings. Therefore, the court clearly did not intend to limit attorney
fee awards to proceedings concerning enforcement actions. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NRDC,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the IBLA specifically rejected the argument that Utah International restricts the scope of section 525(e) in this
fashion. 107 IBLA 359&hyph;60. The Board further stated that ``[t]here is no question that Congress intended to encompass
more than section 525 enforcement proceedings within the bounds of section 525(e)'' (107 IBLA 356, emphasis in original),
and that ``[a]t best, the legislative history supports a limitation of section 525(e) to adjudicatory proceedings''
(107 IBLA 357).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i), which contains the provision in question,
is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA, and he is not approving it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that the regulations submitted by the State do not contain this defect: Chapter V, Section 2.a.(3)
of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure allows the award of costs and expenses to any person who ``initiates or participants
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any contested case proceeding
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under the act'' (emphasis added).

4. Award of Costs and Expenses: Requirement for Separate and Distinct Contribution [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to specify that a participant in an eligible proceeding
who did not initiate the proceeding may receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if that person's contribution
is separate and distinct from the contribution made by the person initiating the proceeding. Neither section 525(e)
of SMCRA nor the corresponding Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1294(b) contain a similar provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the preamble to 43 CFR 4.129(a)(1) clarifies that this requirement is implicit in the provision that, to
be eligible for an award, the party must have made a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the
issues (50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985). Since 43 CFR 4.1294(b) contains a ``substantial contribution'' provision
identical to that of paragraph (a)(1), the same rationale would apply. Accordingly, the Secretary finds that W.S.
35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii), which adds the ``separate and distinct'' stipulation, is not inconsistent with SMCRA
or the Federal regulations, and is approving it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to allow the award of costs and expenses from the
State only if the person claiming eligibility for such an award establishes the existence of a specific violation
of an applicable statute or rule. Neither section 525(e) of SMCRA nor the Federal regulations contain equivalent
language.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 43 CFR 4.1294(b), the corresponding Federal regulation, a person is eligible for an award of costs and expenses
from the regulatory authority if that person ``made a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of
the issues'' and ``prevails in whole or in part, achieving at least some degree of success on the merits.'' While the
preamble to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(1) states that meeting a requirement for a finding that a violation of the Act, regulations
or permit has occurred is comparable to a showing of some degree of success on the merits (50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985),
the reverse of this statement is not true. For example, a person involved in an administrative hearing on a permit decision
can achieve at least some degree of success on the merits (imposition of a permit condition or issuance of a revision
order) without establishing the existence of a specific violation of statute or rule. The same situation exists with
respect to administrative proceedings that end in settlement agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the proposed amendment is in direct conflict with the legislative history of section 525(e) of SMCRA:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 525(e) provides for the award of costs, including attorneys' and expert witness fees, in the discretion of
the Secretary. This section gives the Secretary authority to award attorneys' fees to compensate participants in
the administrative process. The subsection does not require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings result in the finding of a violation nor does the fact that the Government was a party in an adjudicatory
proceeding, or had caused the proceeding to be initiated, prevent an award under the terms of the subsection. It is
the committee's intention that this subsection not be interpreted or applied in a manner that would discourage good
faith actions on the part of interested citizens.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision of H.R. 2 to which this passage applies was subsequently adopted by the conference committee as part
of SMCRA with only minor changes. The accompanying committee report (H.R. Rep. No. 493, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 111 (1977))
contains no language repudiating or modifying the portion of H.R. Rep. No. 218 quoted above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii), which contains the provision in question,
is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1294(b), and is not approving
it.

6. Award of Costs and Expenses: Applicability to Judicial Proceedings and Administrative Proceedings Under EQA
Sections Other Than W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f), the State counterpart to section 525(e) of SMCRA,
by providing in part that costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by parties in connection with a
proceeding under the Act may be assessed against one or more of those parties only if the proceeding is an administrative
proceeding. In relevant part, the revised statute reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever an order is issued under this section, at the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all
costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) as determined by the director to have been reasonably incurred by
the person for or in connection with his participation in the proceeding, including any judicial review of agency
actions, may be assessed against either party as the court or the director deems proper. This subsection shall apply
only to administrative contested case proceedings under the provisions of this act relating to the regulation of
surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with P.L. 95&hyph;87, as that law is worded on August
3, 1977.*&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the first sentence of subsection (f), which is essentially unchanged, would appear to allow assessments
in connection with judicial review proceedings, this provision is now negated by the second sentence, which has been
revised to specify that ``[t]his subsection shall apply 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
administrative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contested case proceedings *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)
as revised is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA, which allows costs and expenses to be assessed in connection
with both administrative and judicial proceedings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the first sentence of subsection (f) (``Whenever an order is issued under this section, *&blank;*&blank;*''),
authorizes the award of costs and expenses only in connection with proceedings concerning enforcement actions since
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 (``this section'') pertains only to such actions. Section 525(e) of SMCRA, which applies
``[w]henever an order is issued under this section, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or as a result of any administrative proceeding under this Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' (emphasis added), is far more expansive in its coverage. Both the plain language of section 525(e) and pertinent
case law (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NRDC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and

Utah International

, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) extend the reach of paragraph (e) beyond section 525, which pertains only to administrative review of enforcement
actions, to administrative and judicial review proceedings under other sections of SMCRA. Therefore, the Secretary
finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA to the extent that the State
statutory provision does not apply to proceedings under sections of the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act other
than W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the preceding discussion, the Secretary is not approving the introductory clause of the first sentence of
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;37(f) (``Whenever an order is issued under this section,''), or the words ``only'' and ``administrative''
in the second sentence of this subsection (``This subsection shall apply only to administrative contested case proceedings
*&blank;*&blank;*'').

7. Award of Costs and Expenses: Cap on Fees and Costs [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 by adding a new subsection (g), which provides that
attorney's fees, expert witness fees or other fees or costs shall not exceed $50.00 per hour. To the extent that this
provision would apply to awards of costs and expenses under subsection (f) of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437, it is inconsistent
with section 525(e) of SMCRA, which authorizes the award of all ``reasonably incurred'' costs and expenses. An inflexible
cap on hourly rates is not in accordance with SMCRA's reasonable cost standard as interpreted by the courts, which
generally use the prevailing community market rate to compute award amounts. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Right to Intervene in Administrative Proceedings: Chapter II, Section 7, DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In findings 22.16 and 22.D (45 FR 20977, March 31, 1980; and 45 FR 78674, November 26, 1980, respectively) concerning
Wyoming's original program submittal and subsequent resubmittal, the Secretary determined that the Wyoming rules
governing intervention in administrative review proceedings did not afford citizens rights of intervention as
broad as those in the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1110. Accordingly, in the approval of the Wyoming program, the
Secretary imposed a condition at 30 CFR 950.11(c) requiring the State to correct this deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 18, 1982, Wyoming submitted a fully promulgated revised version of Chapter II, Section 7 of the DEQ Rules
of Practice and Procedure. The revised version includes a new subsection b. of Section 7 that is substantively identical
to 43 CFR 4.1110. Therefore, the Secretary finds that the revised rules satisfy the intervention component of the
program condition at 30 CFR 950.11(c), and is approving the submittal and modifying the condition accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As submitted on August 18, 1982, this new chapter recognizes the authority of the Director of the DEQ to review and modify
decisions of the administrators of the various divisions within the Department, including the Land Quality Division.
This arrangement is in accordance with standard managerial principles and is analogous to the authority of the Secretary
of the Interior to review and modify decisions of the Director of OSM; therefore, it is not inconsistent with any Federal
requirement under SMCRA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The new rules grant individuals the right to request that the Director of the DEQ hold an informal conference to review
decisions of the Administrator; they also establish procedural, notice and decision requirements to govern such
conferences. There are no Federal counterparts to these provisions, but they are consistent with the purpose of SMCRA
set forth in section 1029(i) of the Act; i.e., the development of procedures for public participation in the program
and its enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, Sections 4 and 5 of this chapter of the State regulations provide that (1) failure to seek informal review
shall not be construed as a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, (2) no evidence as to statements made or evidence
produced by one participant at an informal conference may be introduced by another participant at a subsequent formal
proceeding, and (3) the Director of the DEQ cannot usurp the authority of the EQC. Therefore, the State rules will not
compromise or encumber the formal administrative review process or the right to administrative review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary finds that Chapter VI of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, as submitted on August
18, 1982, is not inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations, and is approving these rules.

10. Definition of ``Toxic Materials''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On August 18, 1982, Wyoming submitted a permanent rule revising the definition of ``toxic materials'' at Chapter
I, Section 2(99) of the LQD Rules and Regulations in a fashion identical to a temporary emergency rule submitted on
May 26, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM approved the emergency rule on September 27, 1982 (47 FR 42351), and, in the same rulemaking document, removed
the corresponding condition of State program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming has since recodified this definition as Chapter I, Section 2(cv) of the LQD Rules and Regulations, but no other
changes have occurred. Similarly, the corresponding Federal definition of ``toxic-forming materials'' at 30 CFR
701.5 has not changed since it was first promulgated on March 13, 1979. Because the permanent State definition at Chapter
I, Section 2(cv) of the LQD Rules is identical to the temporary emergency definition approved by OSM on September 27,
1982, the Secretary finds it to be no less effective than the Federal definition, and is approving it.

and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;22&hyph;12, WY&hyph;22&hyph;14,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that restricting awards of costs and expenses to ``contested case'' proceedings would
be more limiting than and inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294. In particular, several commenters
argued that participants in informal conferences should be eligible for awards of costs and expenses. For the reasons
discussed in finding 2, the Secretary does not agree with the commenters. Case law associated with implementation
of section 525(e) of SMCRA indicates that petitions for awards of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative
proceedings must be entertained only if the proceedings are adjudicatory in nature (although nothing in these decisions
would prohibit the regulatory authority from voluntarily considering petitions submitted in connection with other
types of administrative proceedings). Informal conferences are both predecisional and nonadjudicatory.

 supports awards of costs and expenses in connection with predecisional nonadjudicatory administrative proceedings.
Therefore, by restricting awards to contested case proceedings, the Wyoming amendments do not inappropriately
limit the scope of proceedings in which participants may be eligible for an award of costs and expenses. Additionally,
as discussed in finding 2, the Secretary's approval is predicated upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term ``contested
case'' to include all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses
under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i), which provides that, to receive an award of costs
and expenses from the State, the issues resolved in the proceeding must be those raised in the original complaint within
certain statutory timeframes or within an enforcement action, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43
CFR 4.1294(b) in that it would improperly narrow the type of proceedings for which an award could be made. As discussed
in finding 3, the Secretary agrees, and is not approving this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii), which provides that, to receive an award of costs
and expenses from the State, the contribution of a person who did not initiate a proceeding must be separate and distinct
from the contribution of the person initiating the proceeding, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43
CFR 4.1294(b), which do not contain this provision. For the reasons set forth in detail in finding 4, the Secretary
does not agree. NWF also objected to the lack of a definition for ``initiate.'' However, the commenter provided no
explanation of why such a definition is necessary. Since the Secretary is unaware of any confusion as to the meaning
of this term, which appears to be clear on its face, the Secretary is not requiring that Wyoming provide the definition
requested by the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NWF further stated that this Wyoming statutory provision is in conflict with the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure,
which do not contain equivalent language. In response, the Secretary notes that, like the Federal rules at 43 CFR 4.1294(b),
Section 2.a.(3) of chapter V of the Wyoming rules requires that a person make a substantial contribution to a full and
fair determination of the issues to be eligible for an award of costs and expenses from the regulatory authority. The
preamble to 43 CFR 4.1294 contains the following discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested that the initiator should be required to make a contribution separate and distinct from OSM
in order to be eligible to recover an award of costs. The final regulation was not revised to accommodate this comment.
However, the requirement that a contribution be ``substantial'' precludes an award if a contribution simply duplicates
that of OSM.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, as explained in finding 4, the Secretary finds that the ``separate and distinct'' requirement is an implicit
component of the ``substantial contribution'' requirement, and that there is no conflict between the statute and
the regulations on this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii), which provides that, to receive an award of
costs and expenses from the State, a person must establish the existence of a specific violation of applicable statute
or rule, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294(b). As discussed in detail in finding 5, the
Secretary agrees, and is not approving this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. PRBRC stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1294(d) because it gives the court
or the Director the discretion to assess awards against any person as deemed proper, without reference to whether
the person participated in bad faith for the purpose of harassing or embarrassing the permittee. In response, the
Secretary notes that the provision to which the commenter refers is included in Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice
and Procedure (see paragraphs (2)(a), (4), and (5) of Section 2.a.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. PRBRC noted that Chapter V, Section 1 of DEQ's Rules of Practice and Procedure does not clearly indicate whether
a petition for an award of costs and expenses is to be filed with the EQC or the Director of the DEQ. While this statement
is correct, Sections 2 and 3 of the DEQ Rules clearly assign responsibility for processing these petitions to the EQC.
As discussed in finding 1, the Secretary agrees that language to the contrary in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is confusing
and inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1291, and is not approving the conflicting language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. PRBRC noted that DEQ's Rules of Practice and Procedure do not contain a counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1296. As discussed
in finding 1, no State counterpart is needed since, unlike the two-tiered Federal administrative review system,
Wyoming has only one administrative review entity, the EQC. Hence, administrative review of EQC decisions is not
possible. Likewise, the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1296 do not provide for administrative review of a petition
originally decided by the Interior Board of Land Appeals, the higher-level administrative review body under the
Federal system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. WOC objected to the lack of a State counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2). As discussed in detail in finding 1, no State
counterpart is needed since affected parties have the right to file petitions directly with OSM; there is no requirement
to first exhaust any available State remedies.

9. PRBRC opposed OSM's decision to process the Wyoming submittals as program amendments under 30 CFR 732.17. The commenter
stated that because these submittals pertain to a condition of program approval, the provisions of 30 CFR 732.13(j)
apply instead. The Secretary cannot agree with the commenter. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) specifically
require that all changes to laws and regulations that make up the State program be submitted to OSM as a program amendment.
Both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals fall into this category. Furthermore, the provisions of
30 CFR 732.13(j) apply only if the State has not initiated action to satisfy the condition of program approval, a situation
which does not exist here.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

V. Secretary's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Secretary is approving Wyoming's proposed program amendments as submitted on August
18, 1992, and March 9, 1993, with the exception of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g) (see finding 7) and those provisions
of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) set forth in findings 1, 3, 5, and 6. The Secretary also is revising the cost recovery
component of the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) to reflect the statutory and regulatory changes
made by the proposed amendments consider in this rulemaking. For the reasons discussed in finding 8, the Secretary
is removing the intervention component of the condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal Standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

The Secretary acknowledges that the plaintiff in

the Secretary to make any amendments satisfying condition ``c'' retroactive to May 20, 1983, the deadline the Secretary
had established for Wyoming to comply with the condition. The Secretary does not find the action requested by the plaintiff
to be appropriate in this instance.

Retroactive application of SMCRA regulations is committed to the discretion of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at 13, n. 4. However, retroactive application is inconsistent with the traditional presumption that regulations
are prospective, not retroactive, and that advance notice of their application must be provided. With respect to
the current rulemaking, Wyoming did not propose to apply these amendments retroactively, and the Secretary is adverse
to imposing such a requirement in the absence of a compelling reason to do so. The Powder River plaintiff appears to
be the only party that would be affected positively by a retroactive application. This plaintiff did not rely to its
detriment on the existence of cost recovery provisions in the Wyoming program, but has instead labored for their addition
to the program. In addition, the underlying permit challenge was maintained despite the absence of the provisions
sought by the plaintiff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is reluctant to impose upon Wyoming the obligation to pay past costs and expenses on the basis of retroactive
application of provisions that, prior to this rulemaking, have not been part of the State's approved program. However,
the Secretary's decision not to require retroactive application of these amendments does not preclude Wyoming from
paying all or part of the plaintiff's costs and expenses if the State is so inclined.

VI. Effect of Secretary's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise primary jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program
is approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(a) require that any alteration
of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR
732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. Thus, any changes to the State program are
not enforceable by the State as part of the approved State program until they are approved by the Secretary or the Director.
In oversight of the Wyoming program, the Director will recognize only those statutes, regulations, and other materials
approved by the Director, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials,
and will require the enforcement by Wyoming of only such provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsection (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSM is announcing the non-approval with required amendments of a proposed amendment to the Wyoming permanent regulatory
program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
The amendment, submitted January 6, 1993, and April 13, 1993, pertains to shrub density standards. The proposed amendment
was intended to revise the Wyoming program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards and to incorporate
the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background on the Wyoming Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background
information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions
of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11,
950.12, 950.15 and 950.16.

II. Submission of Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated January 6, 1993, (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;1) Wyoming submitted shrub density
rules as a proposed amendment to its permanent program pursuant to SMCRA. The proposed Wyoming amendment revises
the Land Quality Division (LQD) Rules at Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E), shrub density standard, and Appendix A,
entitled ``Vegetation Sampling Methods and Reclamation Success Standards for Surface Coal Mining Operations.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 15318) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment.
The public comment period ended April 21, 1993. During this public comment period Wyoming submitted additional information
regarding shrub density legislation, Enrolled Act No. 86 [Senate File No. 39] on April 13, 1993 (Administrative Record
No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;21). This proposed legislation amended Wyoming Statute (W.S.) 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e) by
creating new paragraphs (xxxviii) through (xxx), that define agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important
or critical habitat; modified the paragraph at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b), that provides shrub density standards;
and created a new subsection (c) at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402, that would provide shrub density standards on grazingland.

A public meeting was requested and held on June 8, 1993. The summary notes for that meeting are available for public
review (administrative record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;49).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified various concerns in the proposed regulations and legislation,
including the conflicting nature of the proposed rules and statute. OSM notified Wyoming of these concerns by letter
dated August 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;50).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming responded to these concerns by letter dated October 7, 1993, with additional information (Administrative
Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;51). Wyoming's submittal included a table identifying the proposed statutes and rules
that conflict with each other, those that complement one another, and discussions on some of the concerns in the issue
letter.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the amendment submitted by Wyoming on January 6, 1993, and April 13, 1993, and subsequently clarified
on October 7, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii): Definition of Agricultural Lands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii) a definition as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) (xxviii) ``Agricultural lands'' means cropland, pastureland, hayland, or grazingland;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations include a definition of agricultural lands. Wyoming's proposed
statutory definition appears to make explicit what land uses are considered agricultural in nature. Wyoming is combining
specific land uses into a general category but still maintains the individual land use definitions in its program.
Nothing in the Federal program would preclude such combining of land uses into a single category so long as it does not
result in being inconsistent with the Federal and State program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 17, 1993, letter, OSM cautioned the State regarding the exclusion of ``agricultural lands'' from lands
that can contain habitat of unusually high value as proposed at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx) (see discussion
at Finding 3). Wyoming did not address this concern in its October 7, 1993, reply. It appears that the sole purpose of
the proposed statutory definition of ``Agricultural lands'' is its use in the proposed statutory definition of ``Important
habitat or crucial habitat''. Thus the proposed definition would cause the State program to be inconsistent with
the Federal program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the definition of ``Agricultural lands'' as is proposed to be used at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx)
would not be in accordance with the Federal requirements. The Director is: (1) not approving the definition; and (2)
is requiring Wyoming to either clarify how the definition would not render its program less stringent than SMCRA requirements
and less effective than the Federal regulation requirements or repeal the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix): Definition of Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e) a new definition as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xxix) ``Critical habitat'' means only that fish and wildlife habitat designated as critical by the United States
Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Commerce, for the survival and recovery of listed threatened and endangered
species;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations define critical habitat. Wyoming's LQD rules at Chapter
I, Section 2(v) already define the term critical habitat. However, based on Wyoming's clarification submitted October
7, 1993, this rule definition is superseded by the proposed statutory definition (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;51).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All references to critical habitat in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16 and 816/817.97 cite critical habitats
listed by the Secretary under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Under section 3 of ESA, a critical habitat is the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species,
at the time it is listed in accordance with provisions of Section 4 of this Act, on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management consideration
or protection; and (III) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed
*&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ESA does not use the term ``fish and wildlife habitat'' in the definition of critical habitat. Instead, the ESA
only refers to geographic areas with physical or biological features that are essential for the species. The ESA also
defines the term ``species'' as including ``any subspecies of fish or wildlife or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
plants
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and any distinct population segment of any species or vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature''
(Emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Wyoming definition of critical habitat appears to exclude plants. Also, Wyoming has not specified any
State statutes or rules that identify State critical habitat or Threatened and Endangered Species as required by
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16. Additionally, OSM cannot determine whether the term ``fish and wildlife
habitat'' in this definition means fish and wildlife habitat for ESA purposes or fish and wildlife habitat as a land
use. Finally, Wyoming also recognizes critical habitat designated by the ``Secretary of Commerce.'' It is not clear
if this requirement is in addition to the Secretary of the Interior's designation or is an option to use the ``Secretary
of Commerce'' designation instead of the Secretary of Interior's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the proposed statutory definition at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix)
is not in accordance with and is less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving the proposed
definition. Wyoming is required to either repeal this statutory definition or modify it to be in accordance with and
no less effective than the Federal program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx): Definition of Important and Crucial Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx) a definition as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xxx) ``Important habitat'' or ``crucial habitat'' means that fish and wildlife habitat, exclusive of agricultural
lands, which in limited availability, increases the species diversity of a localized area and fulfills one (1) or
more of the essential living requirements of important wildlife species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations include a definition of important habitat or crucial habitat.
However, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780/784.16(a)(2) requires permit applications to include site-specific
resource information when the permit area or adjacent area is likely to include ``habitats of unusually high value
for fish and wildlife such as streams, wetlands, riparian areas, cliffs supporting raptors, areas offering special
shelter or protection, migration routes, or reproduction and wintering areas.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These habitats of unusually high value would appear to be comparable to the State proposed definition for important
or crucial habitat. Additionally, the State regulations at LQD Rule Chapter II, Section 2(a)(i)(E)(II) require
permit applications to include specific information ``if critical or important habitat or migration route disruption
is likely.'' Wyoming's LQD Rule at Chapter II, Section 3(b)(iv)(B) is similar to the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780.16(b)(3)(ii)
in requiring protection and enhancement of ``important habitat for fish and wildlife, such as wetlands, riparian
areas, rimrocks, areas offering special shelter or protection, reproduction and nursery areas, and wintering areas.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Federal permitting and performance standard regulations do not exclude any land uses from consideration
in meeting the requirements for protection and enhancement. Wetlands, riparian areas, migration and wintering
areas can potentially occur within any land use including grazingland, pastureland, forestry, etc. Wyoming's proposed
definition would appear to exclude consideration of important habitat or crucial habitat from those land uses included
in the categorical definition of ``agricultural lands.'' These would include the land uses of cropland, pastureland,
hayland and grazingland.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its August 17, 1993, letter to the State, OSM cautioned that such exclusion would render Wyoming's statute less
effective than the Federal regulations requirements and less stringent than the requirements of SMCRA. In its October
7, 1993, reply to OSM's concerns, Wyoming did not address this issue. Additionally, OSM cannot determine whether
the use of the term ``fish and wildlife habitat'' in this definition means fish and wildlife habitat for ESA purposes
or fish and wildlife habitat as a land use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion the Director finds that the proposed statutory definition at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx)
is not in accordance with and is less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving the proposed
definition. Wyoming is required to either repeal this statutory definition or modify it to be in accordance with and
no less effective than the Federal program requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes to revise existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) as follows (proposed language in upper case):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To the extent federal law or regulations require consultation and approval by state wildlife agencies regarding
surface mining lands to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat, the Wyoming game and fish department shall consider
fish and wildlife habitat to mean as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) and does not include grazingland
as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii). IN ESTABLISHING RECLAMATION STANDARDS PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION THE COUNCIL SHALL APPLY THE DEFINITIONS OF W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed new language requires the Environmental Quality Council to use the following specific statutory definitions
when establishing standards regarding required consultation and approval by State wildlife agencies when lands
are to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat: ``Fish and wildlife habitat'' land use (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi));
``Grazingland'' land use (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii)); ``Agricultural lands'' (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii));
``Critical habitat'' (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix)); and, ``Important habitat or crucial habitat'' (W.S.
35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx)). The statutory definitions for fish and wildlife habitat and grazingland are existing
definitions that were previously approved by OSM. The statutory definitions for agricultural lands, critical habitat,
and important habitat or crucial habitat were proposed by Wyoming in this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in Findings 1, 2, and 3, the three proposed definitions referenced in this provision, W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii),
(xxix) and (xxx), are not being approved by OSM. This provision, if approved, would inappropriately reference the
disapproved definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Environmental Quality Council is already required, by existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b),
to use the land use definitions of fish and wildlife habitat and grazingland at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi)
and (xxvii) when developing reclamation standards for those two postmining land uses. The proposed additional language
is redundant and confusing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the Director finds that the proposed revision to W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) is less stringent
than SMCRA and less effective than the Federal regulations and is not approving it. The Director is requiring Wyoming
to repeal this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 21, 1990, OSM required Wyoming, by letter, pursuant to 30 CFR 732 (required amendment), to revise its program
to be no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cover letter to this submittal, Wyoming specified that existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi),
approved by OSM on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30121), satisfy the required amendment of February 21, 1990. Wyoming did not,
at that time, identify the submission of proposed W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi)
as a response to the required amendment of February 21, 1990, but rather as a State-initiated amendment. OSM approved
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) as a State initiative, leaving the required
amendment outstanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming now contends that the language approved in the previous program amendment was intended to address the portion
of the February 21, 1990, required amendment pertaining to consultation and approval by the appropriate State agencies
responsible for fish and wildlife habitat land uses. Accordingly, OSM has reviewed the State provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b),
as well as the existing State provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), to determine if Wyoming has satisfied
the required program amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i) provide as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Standards for [revegetation] success shall be applied in accordance with the approved postmining land use and,
at a minimum, the following conditions: *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, shelter belts, or forest products, success
of vegetation shall be determined on the basis of tree and shrub stocking and vegetative ground cover. Such parameters
are described as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local
and regional conditions and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration
of forestry and wildlife programs. Consultation and approval may occur on either a program-wide or a permit-specific
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing State statutory provisions at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi),
respectively, provide as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To the extent federal law or regulations require consultation and approval by state wildlife agencies regarding
surface mining lands to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat, the Wyoming game and fish department shall consider
fish and wildlife habitat to mean as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) and does not include grazingland
as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) (xxvi) ``Fish and wildlife habitat'' means land designated wholly or partially to the production, protection,
or management of species of fish or wildlife.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quoted State provisions require the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to use the noted definition of ``fish and
wildlife habitat'' when consulting on the revegetation of lands to be reclaimed to the fish and wildlife habitat land
use. These provisions do not correspond to 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the quoted provisions do not specify if the Wyoming Game and Fish Department would be the appropriate
State agency responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs for any of the land uses, other
than fish and wildlife habitat, mentioned in the Federal regulations (recreation, shelterbelts, and forest products).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, without further clarifying information from Wyoming, the Director finds the statutory provision at
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) combined with the previously approved definition of fish and wildlife habitat at W.S.
35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), does not satisfy OSM's February 21, 1990, required amendment.

5. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(c): Grazingland Shrub Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402 establishment of standards as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For the reclamation of grazingland, operators shall be required to reestablish shrubs on ten percent (10%) of
the affected surface at a density of one (1) shrub per nine (9) square meters, or to a pre-mine density, whichever is
less. The shrubs used for reestablishment shall be those native to the general area, and shall include those found
pre-mining, but the premining dominant shrub need not be the dominant shrub in the post-mining reclamation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SMCRA, at section 515(b)(24), requires that the operator, to the extent possible, using the best technology currently
available (BTCA), minimize disturbances and adverse impacts of the operation on fish, wildlife, and related environmental
values, and achieve enhancement of such resources where practicable. Further, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR
780/784.16 (Fish and wildlife information for permit applications) require resource information of which the scope
and level of detail determined by the regulatory authority in consultation with State and Federal agencies with responsibilities
for fish and wildlife shall be sufficient to design the protection and enhancement plan. This plan shall include a
description of how, to the extent possible using BTCA, the operator will minimize disturbances and adverse impacts
on fish and wildlife and related environmental values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has failed to demonstrate through the submission of documentation and/or other materials, that the proposed
shrub standard: (1) would minimize disturbances and adverse impacts on fish and wildlife and related environmental
values; (2) represents BTCA; and (3) was developed in consultation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds the proposed statutory provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(c) to be less stringent
than SMCRA and less effective than the Federal regulation requirements. The Director is not approving the proposed
statutory provision and is requiring Wyoming to either repeal this statutory provision, modify it to make it consistent
with SMRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations, or provide the required documentation to show that the
standard meets the Federal program requirements.

6. LQD Rules at Chapter IV, Section 2 and Appendix A_Shrub Density Rule and Revegetation Success Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State additionally proposes to revise LQD Rule Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) to require a shrub density standard
of 1 shrub per square meter over 20 percent of the affected surface (including fish and wildlife habitat land use) and
excluding areas where the premining land use was pastureland or cropland. Additionally, the proposed standard can
be reduced to the level of the premine shrub densities if premine shrub densities are less than the proposed success
standard. The proposed rule requires establishment of shrubs in a mosaic pattern to optimize habitat interspersion
and edge effect. A minimum shrub patch size of 0.05 acres is required. For areas of crucial or important habitat, the
Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) must be consulted for recommended reclamation standards for shrub establishment.
Specific criteria and procedures implementing this proposed rule were provided in modifications to Appendix A_Vegetation
Sampling Methods and Reclamation Success Standards for Surface Coal Mining Operations. The modifications provide
examples of acceptable shrub density standards on specific land uses, shrub composition, and acceptable species
type.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several portions of the Federal regulations place requirements with regard to revegetation standards involving
fish and wildlife habitat. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16 require an operator to provide a protection
and enhancement plan for fish and wildlife resources. The scope and level of premine resource information must be
determined in consultation with State and Federal agencies responsible for fish and wildlife and be sufficient to
develop the protection and enhancement plan that describes how, to the extent possible using BTCA, the operator will
minimize disturbance and adverse impacts on fish and wildlife values. An element to be considered is the establishment
of vegetation for wildlife food and cover. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(a)(1) require that standards
for success and statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be selected by the regulatory
authority and included in an approved regulatory program. Additionally, 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i) require that
minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and
regional conditions after consultation with an approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration
of forestry and wildlife programs. Specific land uses include areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat,
recreation, shelter belts, or forest products. Consultation and approval may occur on either a program-wide or a
permit-specific basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule at Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) was the result of an extensive coordination effort involving
LQD, the WGFD, and the coal industry. Public meetings and hearings were also held. Therefore, all necessary processing
was conducted that would allow the Director to render a decision on the proposed rule and appendix.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on Wyoming's clarification submitted October 7, 1993, in the form of a table specifying rules that
conflict with and rules that complement the statutory provisions, it was demonstrated that much of the proposed rule
and modifications to appendix A, conflict with the proposed statutes (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;51).
Furthermore, in its October 7, 1993, reply to OSM's concerns, Wyoming clarified that the legislation (statutory
language) prevails over the conflicting rule language. Consequently, the conflicting proposed rules and modifications
to appendix A cannot be approved since they have been superseded by the statutory language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds the proposed regulations at LQD Rule Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) and proposed modifications
to Appendix A, are in conflict with and are superseded by the proposed statutory provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)
and W.S. 35&hyph;103&hyph;402 (b) and (c), and thus cannot be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director is requiring Wyoming to amend its program to establish revegetation shrub density standards in compliance
with Section 515(b)(24) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16, 816/817.97 and 816/817.116.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM solicited public comment on the proposed amendment and provided opportunity for a public hearing. Numerous comments
were received and a public meeting was held. Since OSM is not approving Wyoming's submittal for the reasons given in
this rulemaking action and since most of the comments provided technical support for the proposed rule and modifications
to Appendix A, that were superseded by the legislative changes, the merit of these comments becomes moot to this rulemaking
effort. However, general categories of comments included:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Most commenters supported the proposed rules (20% standard) as minimum standards or as reasonable standards.
As discussed in Finding 6, the majority of the proposed rules conflict with the proposed statutory standard and therefore
cannot be approved. The legislative standard (10%) is not being approved because of reasons discussed in Finding
5. Since neither standard can be approved the discussion of various technical merits provided by commenters in support
of the two standards becomes irrelevant to this rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several commenters recommended changes to the proposed rules and appendix. As previously stated OSM cannot approve
the proposed rules and appendix for reasons discussed in Finding 6. Thus, detailed discussion of the comments recommending
changes would be of no value to this rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Two commenters supported the proposed statutory standard (10%) and did not support the proposed rules and appendix.
Additionally, they noted that the rules had been superseded by the statutory language and should not be considered
in this amendment. OSM agrees that the proposed rules are superseded by the statutory standard as discussed in Finding
6, but OSM cannot approve the legislative standard (10%) for reasons discussed in Finding 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Several commenters supported, and several did not support, the proposed statutory language at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b)
that provides direction to the Environmental Quality Council in establishing standards. As discussed in Finding
4.a., this provision is confusing and is redundant with Wyoming's approved program. The Director is not approving
it and is requiring Wyoming to repeal this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Most commenters did not support, and several supported, the proposed statutory definitions at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)
(xxviii) through (xxx) that define agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important or crucial habitat. OSM
is not approving these proposed statutory definitions as discussed in Findings 1, 2, and 3. OSM does not agree with
the few comments that supported these definitions as discussed in this rulemaking action.

Pursuant to Section 503(b) of SMCRA and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. A summary of the comments,
and the Director's responses to them, appear below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The U.S. Department of Interior (USDI)_Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USDI_Bureau of
Mines, USDI_Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)_Arlington,
and U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health District 9, responded with no comment (Administrative Record
Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;7, WY&hyph;21&hyph;41, WY&hyph;21&hyph;65, WY&hyph;21&hyph;8, WY&hyph;21&hyph;12,
WY&hyph;21&hyph;32, WY&hyph;21&hyph;59, WY&hyph;21&hyph;14, WY&hyph;21&hyph;4, WY&hyph;21&hyph;31, WY&hyph;21&hyph;56,
and WY&hyph;21&hyph;28).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The USDI_Geological Survey responded to the rule portion of the amendment by praising the botanical approach to
this portion of the Wyoming regulations (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The U.S. Department of Agriculture_Soil Conservation Service commented that the SCS supports the proposed rule
amendment and feels that it is quite workable (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;9, WY&hyph;21&hyph;24,
and WY&hyph;21&hyph;66).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. U.S. Department of Agriculture_Forest Service_Rocky Mountain Region commented that the proposed rule plan is
well written and well thought out. They additionally suggested that weed free native hay be required rather than preferred
as proposed in Appendix A (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;13). As previously noted, neither the proposed
rule nor the modification to the appendix can be approved. Therefore, the suggested requirements for weed free native
hay becomes moot to this rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. U.S. Department of Agriculture_Agricultural Research Service_Northern Plains Area recommended changes to
the proposed rules and appendix. As discussed in Finding 6, the Director is not approving the proposed rules and appendix.
Thus changes to them need not be discussed at this time (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The U.S. Department of Interior_U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or the Service) provided substantial comments
on February 16, April 14, and November 22, 1993 (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;5, WY&hyph;21&hyph;19,
and WY&hyph;21&hyph;64). The comments supported the proposed rules and appendix but not the statutory language.
They additionally recommended several changes to the proposed rules. As discussed above, the majority of the proposed
rules conflict with the statutory language and OSM is not approving either the proposed rules or statutory provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The U.S. Department of Interior_Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provided substantial comments on March 10 and
December 3, 1993 (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;15 and WY&hyph;21&hyph;67). Again the comments
supported the proposed rules and appendix, therefore discussion of BLM's comments would be of no merit.

Based on the above findings, the Director is not approving Wyoming's proposed program amendment as submitted January

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undo delay.
Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

VI. Effect of Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary of the Interior. Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(a) require that any alteration of an approved
State program must be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g)
prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable
by the State as part of the approved State program until approved by the Director. In the oversight of the Wyoming program,
OSM will recognize only statutes, regulations, and other materials approved by the Director, together with any consistent
implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Wyoming of only such
provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule implements section 132 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550,
approved October 28, 1992). Section 132 establishes a demonstration program to facilitate self-sufficiency and
to permit the homeownership sale of single family homes administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha
in the State of Nebraska. The purpose of the demonstration is to exhibit the effectiveness of promoting homeownership
and providing support services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule is closely modeled on the interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program codified in 24
CFR part 906. Section 132 specifies that the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha (hereafter the Housing Authority)
is the organization to carry out the demonstration program. The Housing Authority is already administering a homeownership
program approved pursuant to Section 5(h) of the United States Housing Act of 1937. In its correspondence with the
Department concerning the demonstration program, the Housing Authority has indicated that it wishes to operate
the demonstration program in a fashion similar to that of its existing Section 5(h) program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many areas of similarity between the Section 5(h) homeownership program and the demonstration program.
The Department believes that, in light of the Housing Authority's desire to pattern the demonstration program upon
its existing Section 5(h) homeownership program and the Department's substantial experience with the Section 5(h)
homeownership program, it should use language from the existing 5(h) regulation whenever appropriate in this interim
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of clear differences between the demonstration and the Section 5(h) regulation. Because the demonstration
program is established pursuant to legislation that is not part of the 1937 Act, it is not subject to the replacement
requirements of the 1937 Act. The demonstration program also gives the Housing Authority greater freedom in selecting
participant homebuyers under the program than the Section 5(h) program permits. There is, however, a specific mandate
that, ``[i]n conducting the demonstration, the Housing Authority shall affirmatively further fair housing objectives.''
There is also a statutory obligation that ``[t]he Housing Authority shall ensure the availability of supportive
services to each family participating in the demonstration program.''

Justification for Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking at 24 CFR part 10. However, section 132(g) requires that the Secretary implement
this demonstration by issuing interim regulations, allowing for a 60-day public comment period. The Department
has adopted a policy of setting an expiration date for an interim rule unless a final rule is published before that date.
This ``sunset'' provision appears in &sect;907.1(b) of the interim rule, and provides that the interim rule will
expire on a date 12 months from publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 132(g) also requires that the interim regulation be effective upon issuance. The Department interprets
this provision as superseding the requirement for a 30-day delay between publication and effective date of a rule
required by section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the
provisions of this interim rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being,
except to the extent that the program authorized by the interim rule will increase homeownership opportunities for
low-income families in Omaha, Nebraska. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further review under the Order.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This part implements section 132 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved
October 28, 1992) (hereafter section 132). Section 132 establishes a demonstration program to facilitate self-sufficiency
and permits the homeownership sale of single family homes administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha
in the State of Nebraska (hereafter ``the Housing Authority''). The purpose of the demonstration is to exhibit the
effectiveness of promoting homeownership and providing support services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part applies to single-family public housing units administered by the Housing Authority that have been designated
by the Housing Authority for eventual homeownership. Before entering into a contract or other obligation to sell
a home to a homebuyer under this part, the Housing Authority will give the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(hereafter HUD) a written proposed designation that a home is to be sold under this part. The proposed designation
shall specify the address of the unit(s) to be sold. HUD shall review the proposed designation to ensure that the designated
home is single family public housing, that the Housing Authority has not designated more than twenty percent of the
total number of public housing units that it administers and that the location of the homes complies with fair housing
requirements. (The twenty percent ceiling on the number of homes that can be designated is 602 homes plus twenty percent
of any additional public housing units developed by the Housing Authority through the award of public housing development
funds pursuant to section 5 of the 1937 Act subsequent to October 28, 1992 that do not constitute replacement units
for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to Section 18 of the 1937 Act or the Section 5(H) or Title III homeownership
programs under the 1937 Act.) Consistent with the Housing Authority's affirmative obligation to further fair housing
objectives, the Housing Authority shall offer homeownership opportunities in a variety of locations and promote
an expanded housing choice for minorities. Homeownership opportunities for minorities shall include locations
not located in an area of minority concentration.

General authority for sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Housing Authority may sell single family homes designated pursuant to &sect;907.2, for purposes of homeownership,
according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this part. If the home is subject to indebtedness under the
ACC, HUD will continue to make any debt service contributions for which it is obligated under the ACC, and the property
sold will not be subject to the encumbrance of that indebtedness. (In the case of a home that is part of a development
with financing restrictions (such as a bond-financed development), however, sale is subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable restrictions.) In reference to housing properties, ``development'' means the same as ``project,''
as defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937 (hereafter the 1937 Act), rather than the statutory definition
of ``development.'' Upon sale in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute a release
of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale,
it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding for operating subsidies or modernization under the 1937 Act upon
conveyance of title by the PHA. (That does not preclude any other types of post-sale subsidies that may be available,
under other Federal, State, or local programs, such as the possibility of available assistance under Section 8 of
the 1937 Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative homeownership.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will approve the Housing Authority's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The plan must be practically workable, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including
the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The plan must be consistent with law, including the requirements of this part, any other applicable Federal, State,
and local statutes and regulations, and existing contracts. Subject to the other two criteria stated in this section,
any provision that is not contrary to those legal requirements may be included in the plan, at the discretion of the
Housing Authority, whether or not expressly authorized in this part.

Consultation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing a proposed homeownership plan, and in carrying out the plan after HUD approval, the Housing Authority
shall consult with residents of the homes to be designated pursuant to &sect;907.2, and with any resident organization
that represents them, as necessary and appropriate to provide them with information and a reasonable opportunity
to make their views and recommendations known to the Housing Authority. Except where otherwise indicated by the context,
``resident'' means the same as ``tenant,'' as the latter term is used in the 1937 Act. In a case where vacant units are
expected to be available for purchase, the Housing Authority shall consult with any resident organization or organizations
that represent the prospective purchasers, as indicated by the eligibility standards stated in the plan, and with
any Resident Management Corporation (RMC) formed by residents of the Housing Authority's public housing developments.
While this Part gives the Housing Authority sole legal authority for final decisions as to whether or not to participate
in the homeownership program under this part, as to whether or not to submit a proposed homeownership plan and the content
of such a proposal, the Housing Authority shall give residents and their resident organizations full opportunity
for input in the homeownership planning process, and full consideration of their concerns and opinions.

Where individual residents, a RMC, or another form of resident organization may wish to initiate discussion of a possible
homeownership plan, the Housing Authority shall negotiate with them in good faith. Joint development and submission
of the plan by the Housing Authority and RMC, or other resident organization, is encouraged. In addition, participation
of a RMC or other resident organization in the implementation of the plan is encouraged.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The unit must be free from any defects that pose a danger to life, health, or safety and shall meet minimum housing standards
(except as permitted below) before transfer of an ownership interest to a purchaser (or execution of a lease with an
option to purchase). The minimum housing standards requirement shall be met either by complying with local housing
codes or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established by HUD for the Section 8 Certificate program.
The Housing Authority prior to sale shall inspect, or ensure inspection of, each unit to determine it does not pose
an imminent threat to the life, health, or safety of current or future residents and that the property has passed recent
fire and other applicable safety inspections conducted by appropriate local officials and that the unit does comply
with minimum housing standards. Higher standards may be proposed by the Housing Authority or required by lenders.
The property also must meet the requirements for elimination of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing,
under subpart C of 24 CFR part 35. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining
useful life that is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers.
These standards must be met as a condition for sale of a dwelling to an individual purchaser (or execution of a lease
with an option to purchase), unless the terms of sale (or lease) include measures to assure that the work will be completed
within a reasonable time after the purchase (or lease), not to exceed two years (e.g., as a part of a mortgage financing
package that provides the purchaser with a home improvement loan or pursuant to a sound sweat equity arrangement).

Fair housing objectives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting the demonstration, the Housing Authority shall affirmatively further fair housing objectives. Prior
to marketing the homes, placing an occupant in a vacant public housing unit designated pursuant to &sect;907.2, or
entering into a contract or other obligation to sell the homes, the Housing Authority shall submit to HUD for its approval
an affirmative fair housing marketing strategy for informing and soliciting applications from people who are least
likely to apply, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, for the homeownership
program without special outreach. (See &sect;92.351 of this title for an example of an affirmative fair housing marketing
strategy.) HUD shall review the affirmative fair housing marketing strategy to ensure that it complies with all fair
housing requirements. Once HUD approves the affirmative fair housing marketing strategy, the Housing Authority
must comply with the strategy's provisions in marketing the homes to purchasers. If the initial sale will be to a resident-owned
cooperative or condominium, the cooperative or condominium shall also be required to comply with the provisions
of the affirmative fair housing marketing strategy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall include evidence of interest by the family in homeownership,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Homebuyer eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility shall be limited to residents who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership,
under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of public housing operating
subsidies and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the Housing Authority. A homeownership plan
may, however, take account of any available subsidy from other sources (e.g., if available, assistance under Section
8 of the 1937 Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative ownership). Under this affordability standard, an applicant
must meet the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The monthly expenditure for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance by an eligible purchaser plus estimated
utility costs and other monthly housing costs (such as maintenance and condominium or cooperative monthly fees)
shall be not more than 35 percent of the adjusted family income of the purchaser, determined in accordance with parts
913 or 905 of this title, as appropriate. The Housing Authority may request that HUD approve a higher percentage cap,
where the application demonstrates that a higher cap than 35 percent is necessary to make the homeownership program
feasible and that the purchaser will be able to afford the higher monthly cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of cooperative or condominium ownership, if the monthly charge to the homeowner includes amounts for
principal, interest, taxes, insurance, or utilities, the portion of the charge covering these amounts shall be considered
for purposes of making the affordability determinations under this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Housing Authority can pay any amounts required for closing, such as a down payment (if any) and closing costs
chargeable to the purchaser, as may be specified in the homeownership plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures/Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Strategy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Housing Authority must establish written equitable procedures for identifying and selecting eligible families
to participate in the homeownership program. The Housing Authority must have an affirmative fair housing marketing
strategy that applies whenever homeownership opportunities are made available to other than current residents
of the property. Selections made from the Housing Authority's waiting list for the homeownership program must be
in a nondiscriminatory manner in accordance with HUD approved preferences.

Supportive services available under the demonstration program may include counseling, remedial education, education

If an existing resident of a dwelling authorized for sale under a homeownership plan is ineligible to purchase, or

However, no person who is a tenant of public housing may be involuntarily relocated or displaced (forced to relocate
permanently) from his or her dwelling as a result of the demonstration program. A violation of this relocation/ displacement
prohibition may, in addition to applicable program sanctions, trigger a requirement to provide relocation assistance
in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, and implementing
rules.

(3) Replacement housing assistance sufficient to permit relocation to suitable, decent, safe and sanitary replacement
housing (at a rent no higher than permitted by the 1937 Act) in accordance with the relocation assistance component
of the HUD-approved homeownership assistance program. This requirement will be met if the resident is offered the
opportunity to relocate to another suitable dwelling under the Public Housing Program, any of the housing assistance
programs under Section 8 of the 1937 Act, or any other Federal, State, or local program that is comparable, as to standards
for housing quality, admission and rent, to the programs under the 1937 Act, and provides a term of assistance of at

To ensure affordability by eligible purchasers, by the standard adopted under &sect;907.8(c), a homeownership
plan may provide for below-market purchase prices or below-market financing, or a combination of the two. Discounted
purchase prices may be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the particular purchaser's ability to pay, or
may be determined by any other fair and reasonable method (e.g., uniform prices for a group of comparable dwellings,
within a range of affordability by a group of potential purchasers).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Financing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any type of private or public financing may be used (e.g., conventional, Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA), or a State or local program). The Housing Authority may finance or assist in financing purchase
by any methods it may choose, such as purchase money mortgages, guarantees of mortgage loans from other lenders, shared
equity, or lease-purchase arrangements. The homeownership plan shall avoid using financing, such as a mortgage
that is not fully amortizing (such as a ``balloon'' mortgage) or that involves negative amortization, that would
impair the continued affordability of the property for eligible families.

A homeownership plan shall include appropriate protections against any risks of fraud or abuse that are presented
by the particular plan, such as extended use of the dwelling by the purchaser as rental property, or collusive sale
that would circumvent the resale profit limitation of &sect;907.14.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a dwelling is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, the homeownership plan shall provide
for appropriate measures to preclude realization by purchasers of windfall profit on resale. ``Windfall profit''
means all or a portion of the resale proceeds attributable to the purchase price discount (the fair market value at
date of purchase from the Housing Authority less the below-market purchase price), as determined by one of the methods
described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Subject to that requirement, however, purchasers should
be permitted to retain any resale profit attributable to appreciation in value after purchase, or a reasonable portion
of such profit, under a limited or shared equity arrangement, along with any portion of the resale profit that is fairly
attributable to improvements made by them after purchase.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where there is potential for a windfall profit because the dwelling unit is sold to the initial purchaser for less than
fair market value, the initial purchaser shall execute a promissory note, payable to the Housing Authority, along
with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note, on the following terms and conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The principal amount of indebtedness shall be the lesser of:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the
note as a dollar amount; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall
define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The discounted purchase price; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial
purchaser during tenure as a homeowner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the option of the Housing Authority, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over
a specified period of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total
forgiveness of the indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments
of not more than 20 percent. This does not require the Housing Authority's plan to provide for any such reduction at
all, or preclude it from specifying terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing
sentence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the Housing Authority shall (by
an appropriate form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the
Housing Authority, to be based solely on the Housing Authority's determination that the resale price represents
fair market value or a lesser amount that will result in payment to the Housing Authority, under the note, of the full
amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction, if provided for under paragraph (b)(2) of
this section). If so determined, the Housing Authority shall be obligated to approve the resale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Housing Authority may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory
note, in favor of an additional mortgage given by the purchaser as security for a home improvement loan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limited equity method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a second option, the requirement of this section may be satisfied by an appropriate form of limited equity arrangement,
restricting the amount of net resale profit that may be realized by the seller (the initial purchaser and successive
purchasers over a period prescribed by the homeownership plan) to the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The seller's paid-in equity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The portion of the resale proceeds attributable to any improvements paid for or performed by the seller during
homeownership tenure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An allowance for appreciation in value, calculated by a fair and reasonable method specified in the homeownership
plan (e.g., according to a price index factor or other measure). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of this section may be satisfied by any other fair and reasonable arrangement that will accomplish
the essential purposes stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

Determinations of fair market value under this section shall be made on the basis of appraisal within a reasonable
time prior to sale by an independent appraiser, to be selected by the Housing Authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying
out the homeownership plan, be retained by the Housing Authority and used for housing assistance to low-income families
(as such families are defined under the 1937 Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers
for credit to the purchase price (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
earnest money, down payments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments
under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under &sect;907.14, and interest earned
on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permissible uses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families,
at the discretion of the Housing Authority and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for special purposes that are justified
to ensure the success of the plan, and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the Housing Authority and any other
entity with responsibility for carrying out the plan. Examples include a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent
or cure default, or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any contingent liabilities of the Housing Authority
under the homeownership plan (such as Housing Authority guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve for Housing Authority
repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and
for reasonable planning and administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In connection with a State or local homeownership program for low-income families, for assistance to purchasers
and for reasonable planning and administrative costs. Under such programs, sales proceeds may be used to construct
or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families, or to assist such families in purchasing other dwellings
from public or private owners. Where this kind of use is proposed, the homeownership plan must include a description
of the State or local homeownership program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) In connection with the Housing Authority's other public housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized
for the use of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the 1937 Act and Federal regulations, as included
in the HUD-approved operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating
reserves, protective services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating
subsidy otherwise payable to the Housing Authority under 24 CFR part 990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Housing Authority shall be responsible for the maintenance of records (including sales and financial records,
which contain racial and ethnic characteristics of the purchasers) for all activities incident to implementation
of the HUD-approved homeownership plan. These records include those pertaining to the affirmative fair housing
marketing strategy and the nondiscriminatory selection of purchasers. Until all planned sales of individual dwellings
have been completed, the Housing Authority shall submit to HUD annual sales reports, in a form prescribed by HUD. The
receipt, retention, and use of the sale proceeds shall be covered in the regular independent audits of the Housing
Authority's public housing operations, and any supplementary audits that HUD may find necessary for monitoring.
Where another entity is responsible for sale of individual units, pursuant to &sect;907.7(b), the Housing Authority
must ensure that the entity's responsibilities include proper record keeping and accountability to the Housing
Authority, sufficient to enable the Housing Authority to monitor compliance with the approved homeownership plan,
to prepare its reports to HUD, and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books and records shall be subject to inspection
and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Whether to develop and submit a proposed homeownership plan is a matter within the discretion of the Housing Authority.
The Housing Authority may initiate a proposal at any time, according to the following procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Conditional approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conditional approval may be given, at HUD discretion, where HUD determines that to be justified. For example, conditional
HUD approval might be a necessary precondition for the Housing Authority to obtain the funding commitments required
to satisfy the requirements for final HUD approval of a complete homeownership plan. Where conditional approval
is granted, HUD will specify the conditions in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon HUD notification to the Housing Authority that the homeownership plan is approvable (in final form that satisfies
all applicable requirements of this part), the Housing Authority and HUD will execute a written implementing agreement,
in a form prescribed by HUD, to evidence HUD approval and authorization for implementation. The plan itself, as approved
by HUD, shall be incorporated in the implementing agreement. Any of the items of supporting documentation may also
be incorporated, if agreeable to the parties. The Housing Authority shall be obligated to carry out the approved homeownership
plan and other provisions of the implementing agreement without modification, except with written approval by HUD.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage upper deck
tension ties, and repair or modification of any cracked tension ties. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue
cracking in tension ties. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more tension
ties and the resultant rapid decompression of the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Recently, the FAA has received reports of fatigue cracking in the tension ties on several Boeing Model 747 series airplanes.
Most of the cracks were found in the aft channel of the tension tie. These cracks usually occurred in the upper flange
of the aft channel of the tension tie. Only one crack was found in the forward channel of the tension tie. The cause of
this fatigue cracking has been attributed to the tension ties bending under cabin pressurization loads. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane in the event of failure of two or more tension
ties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These reports of fatigue cracks were received in response to the Supplemental Structural Inspection Program, which
was required to be implemented by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993). The
purpose of that AD is to implement an inspection program that detects the potential for cracking in specific areas
of the airplane that are critical for flight safety. Whenever cracks are found in a Structural Significant Item, the
FAA takes rulemaking action to correct these findings of an unsafe condition. This proposal is in response to such
a finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 4, 1984, the FAA issued AD 84&hyph;19&hyph;01, amendment 39&hyph;4913 (49 FR 36365, September 17, 1984),
to require inspections of the tension tie at body station (BS) 760 on a certain group of Model 747 series airplanes,
and at BS 780 on certain other Model 747 series airplanes. The inspections proposed by this rulemaking action do not
retract the inspection requirements of that AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2371, dated July 29, 1993, that describes
procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension ties, and repair or
modification of cracked tension ties. This modification entails trimming the cracked portion of the channel of the
tension tie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension
ties, and repair or modification of cracked tension ties. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are approximately 203 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $31,075, or $275 per airplane.
This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment submitted by Indiana as a modification to the State's permanent
regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment (number 93&hyph;7) consists of proposed changes to the Indiana Surface Mining
Rules provisions concerning OSM Regulatory Reform I, II, and III issues, required program amendments, and State
initiatives. The primary focus of the amendments is on soil capability and restoration standards, individual civil
penalties, significant/nonsignificant revisions, coal exploration, and performance bonds. The amendment is
intended to resolve outstanding issues that remain present in the approved Indiana program resulting from changes
to the Federal program. The amendment would also incorporate changes desired by the State that address various parts
of the State rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice sets forth the times and locations that the Indiana program and the proposed amendment to that program
will be available for public inspection, the comment period during which interested persons may submit written comments

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background on the Indiana Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the
disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found
in the July 26, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at
30 CFR 914.10, 914,15, and 914.16.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since July 29, 1982, (the date of conditional approval of the Indiana program), a number of changes have been made to
the Federal regulations concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Pursuant to the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 732.17, OSM informed Indiana on May 22, 1985 (Regulatory Reform I), on August 24, 1988 (Regulatory Reform
II), and on September 20, 1989 (Regulatory Reform III), that a number of Indiana regulations are less effective than
or inconsistent with the revised Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter date December 30, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1322), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package (number 93&hyph;7) consisting of revisions to 38 sections
of the Indiana rules. These revisions address changes to the Indiana program that were identified in the three letters
referred to above, and certain required program amendments. The State has also proposed additional changes which
Indiana believes will further improve the approved State program. The primary focus of the submittal is on soil capability
and restoration standards, individual civil penalties, significant/non-significant revisions, coal exploration,
and performance bonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts
730, 731, and 732 have been met.

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of additional revisions pertaining to a previously proposed amendment to the Utah permanent
regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of
1977 (SMCRA). The additional revisions for Utah's proposed rules pertain to the scope of rulemaking and promulgation
of rules, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining, confidentiality of coal exploration
information, and mining in special areas, specifically prime farmland. The amendment is intended to incorporate
the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal regulations, clarify ambiguities, and improve operational
efficiency.

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated August 2, 1993, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;851). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Utah proposed revisions to
the Utah Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) at Utah Administrative Rules (Utah
Admin. R.) 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, scope of rulemaking, and 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, promulgation of rules. Utah
also proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, petitions to initiate
rulemaking; 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining and
reclamation operations; 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, confidentiality of coal exploration information; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661,
permit application blasting level chart; 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, permit application cross sections and maps
showing hydrologic information; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 and 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, special areas
of mining, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 45305) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on its adequacy (administrative record
No. UT&hyph;865). The public comment period ended September 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns for (1) Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, regarding the incorrect
reference to its rulemaking authority at Utah Code Annotated (UCA) 40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), which was repealed by
Utah in 1993; (2) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, regarding the need for agreement between the petitioners
and intervenors to change the location of a public hearing on a petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining;
(3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, regarding the proposed deletion of the phrase ``and the information is
confidential'' which would impart a change in the criteria for determining coal exploration information that is
or is not allowed to be held confidential under the Utah program, and the proposed reference to Utah's Government Records
Access and Management Act (GRAMA) in that certain aspects of GRAMA were previously found to be less effective than
the Federal regulations with regard to the restrictions it imposes on the availability of coal exploration information;
and (4) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, regarding the need to use the prime farmland soil survey standards
in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Handbook 436, as it existed on October 5, 1982, and USDA Handbook 18, as it
existed on November 16, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated December 9, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;878). Utah
responded in a letter dated January 7, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposes the following additional revisions to its existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Utah proposes
to reference UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), which applies to rulemaking authority under the Utah Mined Land Reclamation
Act. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposes (1) that unless the petitioners and intervenors agree
otherwise, the Board shall hold a public hearing within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate
lands unsuitable for mining; (2) if all petitioners and intervenors agree that a public hearing is not needed, the
hearing need not be held; and (3) all hearings held under Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441 will be held in the locality
of the area covered by the petition. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Utah proposes to require that the Utah
Division of Oil, Gas and Mining will not make coal information available for public inspection if the person submitting
it requests in writing , at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is confidential under
the standards of the Federal Act (SMCRA). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposes to require
that USDA soils Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982,
and November 16, 1982.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Utah program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to
reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``DATES'' or at
locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.

This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866
(Regulatory Planning and Review).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its adjudication regulations concerning compensation
for disabilities or deaths resulting from the chronic effects of in-service exposure to mustard gas and other vesicant
agents. This proposed regulation is based on a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study of the long-term health effects
of exposure to vesicant agents, commissioned by VA, which found a relationship between such exposure and the subsequent
development of certain conditions. The intended effect of this proposed amendment is to expand and extend compensation
eligibility.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 31, 1992, VA published a final regulation (38 CFR 3.316) authorizing service connection in claims from veterans
who underwent full-body exposure to mustard gas during field or chamber experiments to test protective clothing
or equipment during World War II, and who subsequently develop chronic forms of laryngitis, bronchitis, emphysema,
asthma, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or corneal opacities (See 57 FR 1699&hyph;1700 and 57 FR 33875&hyph;77). The
regulation was based on a review of the available English language medical literature dealing with the effects of
exposure to mustard gas by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) personnel. VA also contracted with NAS to conduct
a review of the world medical and scientific literature, including that published in languages other than English,
to determine the long-term health effects of exposure to mustard agents and Lewisite. After reviewing almost 2,000
medical and scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
papers, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings, NAS issued that report, entitled ``Veterans
at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite'', on January 6, 1993. We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.316
based upon our review of that report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NAS findings confirmed VA's prior determination that there is a relationship between exposure to mustard gas and
the subsequent development of the seven conditions previously mentioned. NAS also found that the evidence indicated
a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and the subsequent development of ``recurrent corneal ulcerative
disease'' and ``delayed recurrent keratitis of the eye.'' In our judgment the term ``corneal opacities,'' used in
the current regulation, is broad enough to include corneal ulcerative disease and we do not propose to change the language
in the current regulation. For reasons discussed below, this regulation will cover specified conditions whether
onset occurred immediately after exposure or was delayed, and we find no reason to modify the term ``keratitis'' which
appears in the current regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS also found that the evidence indicated a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and the subsequent
development of nasopharyngeal, laryngeal, lung, and skin cancers, pigmentation abnormalities of the skin, and
chronic skin ulceration and scar formation. We propose to add nasopharyngeal, laryngeal and lung cancer (except
mesothelioma) to the list of conditions for which presumptive service connection may be granted based on exposure
to mustard gas. We are proposing to exclude mesothelioma from the regulatory amendment, however, since the only known
cause of that condition is asbestos exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although NAS used the term ``skin cancer'' in the summary of its findings, in our judgment the body of the report, which
refers to squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the skin but not malignant melanomas, does not support so broad
a presumption of service connection. Although basal cell skin cancers were noted in some animal studies, these studies
constitute evidence of carcinogenicity rather than evidence of skin cancer because there is no good animal model
for human skin response to mustard agents. Likewise, the one occupational study that described basal cell carcinomas,
Bowen's disease, and other hyperkeratotic skin lesions was too seriously flawed to establish a causal relationship
with exposure to mustard agents. As the report notes, the workers in that study were exposed to all types of gases, not
just mustard gas and Lewisite. Also, those individuals who participated in chamber and field testing suffered acute
rather than chronic exposure like the chemical plant workers in the occupational study, which occurred for many hours
each week over many years. The report states that ``cutaneous cancers following acute sulfur mustard exposure usually
localize in scars,'' and scar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, not basal cell carcinomas. Finally, since the
1973 Jackson and Adams study, which is cited in the NAS report in reference to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the occurrence of basal cell carcinoma and which included two cases of basal cell carcinomas in World War I veterans,
is not an epidemiologic study, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to whether the findings represent an unusual
rate for basal cell carcinoma. For these reasons, we propose to include only squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our judgment, there is no reason to establish presumptive service connection for ``pigmentation abnormalities
of the skin'' because these abnormalities would be obvious from the time of the exposure to vesicant agents rather
than occurring many years after exposure, as in the case of cancer. Also, because the usual places for mustard gas burns
are areas of the body which are not visible, i.e., moist areas of the body such as the groin and axilla, rather than exposed
areas as in the case of sunburn, most pigmentation abnormalities resulting from these burns would not be considered
disabling, unless they interfered with the veteran's ability to function. In this regard, there is no mention in the
NAS report of vitiligo-type lesions, which are usually considered to be disabling because they are disfiguring.
Since compensation is only payable for a disability resulting from an injury suffered or disease contracted in line
of duty or from aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease contracted in line of duty (See 38 U.S.C. 1110, 1121,
1131, and 1310), and since exposure to vesicant agents does not cause a type of pigmentation abnormality which is disabling,
we do not propose to include pigmentation abnormalities of the skin in the regulation. However, we propose to include
scar formation in the regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the respiratory conditions VA had previously recognized, NAS found that the evidence indicated a causal
relationship between exposure to mustard gas and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NAS further found that
all these respiratory conditions could also result from exposure to Lewisite, another vesicant agent. We are proposing
to provide service connection for a chronic form of laryngitis, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, as a result of exposure to mustard gas or Lewisite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, NAS determined that the evidence indicated a causal relationship exists between exposure to nitrogen
mustard and the subsequent development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Based on that information, we propose
to provide service connection for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia as a result of exposure to nitrogen mustard only.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS also found evidence that indicates a causal relationship between mustard gas exposure and the subsequent development
of bone marrow depression, immunosuppression, psychological disorders, and sexual dysfunction, but we do not propose
to allow presumptive service connection for these conditions. Bone marrow depression and immunosuppression are
acute effects that may have resulted in greater susceptibility to infections with a possibility of damage to vital
organ systems. Since these acute effects would have resolved within a relatively short period, however, any related
infection would have occurred in service or shortly thereafter and an adequate regulatory framework to establish
direct service connection already exists. Psychological disorders may result from traumatic or stressful features
of the exposure experience, but are not a toxic effect of the agents themselves. An adequate regulatory framework
currently exists to establish service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of exposure to vesicant
agents. Establishing a presumption of service connection for sexual dysfunction would serve no purpose, since sexual
dysfunction is not compensated under VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 CFR Part 4) but rather under 38 U.S.C.
1114(k), which provides special monthly compensation for the loss or loss of use of a creative organ. Special monthly
compensation is a benefit established by Congress, not by VA regulation, and is therefore beyond the scope of this
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were two other categories of findings in the NAS report. NAS found that the evidence was ``suggestive'' of a causal
relationship between exposure to mustard gas and reproductive dysfunction (genotoxicity, mutagenicity, etc.)
and exposure to sulfur mustard and leukemia. NAS found insufficient evidence of a causal relationship between exposure
to mustard gas and gastrointestinal diseases, hematologic diseases, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases,
and for reproductive dysfunction as a result of exposure to Lewisite. As NAS itself indicates, further study in these
areas is necessary and in our judgment, the scientific and medical evidence on the whole does not support the establishment
of presumptions for these conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the revised regulation will address the effects of Lewisite as well as mustard agents, we propose to revise the
heading of 38 CFR 3.316 to indicate that the regulation addresses claims based on chronic effects of exposure to vesicant
agents rather than mustard gas only. The current regulation applies only to those veterans exposed while participating
in secret tests of protective equipment during World War II; we propose to expand it to cover any verified full-body
exposure during military service, which will allow veterans exposed to mustard gas under battlefield conditions
in World War I, those present at the German air raid on the harbor of Bari, Italy, in World War II, and those engaged in
manufacturing and handling vesicant agents during their military service to be eligible for consideration under
this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not proposing to include veterans who were exposed to vesicant agents via patch or drop testing. The literature
upon which the NAS report is based covered animal studies and two types of human studies: (1) Industrial studies of
workers in chemical factories which manufactured mustard gas; and (2) studies of soldiers exposed to mustard gas
in warfare, primarily during World War I. These studies involved full-body exposure, not patch testing. The NAS report
does not discuss any studies relevant to patch or drop testing. However, the NAS report concluded that the exposure
of many participants in chamber and field tests was equivalent to that of soldiers in World War I, and therefore the
NAS report concluded that the World War I and chronic exposure studies were relevant to the experience in the chamber
and field tests. Since the NAS report only considered studies involving full-body exposure, we believe that the NAS
findings regarding specific diseases are linked only to full-body exposure, and not to patch or drop testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to amend 38 CFR 3.316 by adding a requirement that service connection will not be established if there
is affirmative evidence that establishes a nonservice-related supervening condition or event as the cause of the
claimed condition. The current regulation is based upon a literature search of the immediate and short-term effects
of mustard gas exposure by the Veterans Health Administration, which revealed that nonfatal exposures to mustard
gas result in an immediate acute injury. It was also reported that any chronic disability related to mustard gas exposure
should appear shortly after the exposure and continue to the present. The NAS report, however, found that delayed
effects of mustard gas exposure may appear even though no acute effects were noted. Because of this delay in manifestation
of effects of mustard gas exposure reported by the NAS, during which time the veteran may have been exposed to other
nonservice-related causative conditions or events, we have determined that it is reasonable to consider evidence
of intervening cause which may exist, just as we do for other presumptive conditions (See 38 CFR 3.307(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on California under the discretionary
sanction authority provided the Agency under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure by the State
to submit a complete SIP revision for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program as required
by the Act for certain ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas. On November 13, 1992, the California Air
Resources Board (CARB), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment (committal SIP) to adopt an I/M
program by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption and implementation of an enhanced I/M program
meeting all requirements of EPA's I/M regulations and includes an implementation schedule. On June 28, 1993, EPA
proposed to conditionally approve this committal SIP or alternatively to disapprove it if certain milestones contained
in the schedule were missed. A full SIP revision including state legislative authority to implement the program was
required by November 15, 1993. The State Legislature adjourned on September 10, 1993 without having enacted legislation
providing authority for implementing the enhanced I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1993, the State submitted a document entitled ``Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program SIP Revision''
(the ``proposed SIP revision''). The proposed SIP revision was missing critical elements required for compliance
with section 182(c)(3) of the Act. On December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 issued a letter finding that the State had failed
to submit a complete SIP revision required under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. The letter dated December 30, 1993,
notified the State that the proposed SIP revision was incomplete because it had not been subject to public notice.
Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either the requirements of the Act or its
commitment to adopt and implement an enhanced I/M program as promised in its committal SIP, EPA proposes to exercise
its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation sanction and a 2 for 1 offset
sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review provisions of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended in 1990, the Clean Air Act requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or to implement
new ones for certain nonattainment areas. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed EPA to publish updated guidance
for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of
these programs. The Act further requires each area required to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into
the SIP. Based on these requirements, EPA promulgated I/M regulations on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 182(c)(3) and 187(b)(1) of the Act, areas designated as serious and worse ozone nonattainment areas
with 1980 populations of 200,000 or more and CO nonattainment areas with design classifications above 12.7 ppm and
populations of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more
in the northeast ozone transport region, are required to meet EPA regulations for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These
areas were required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an enhanced I/M program into the SIP by November 15, 1992.
In California, the State must adopt and implement enhanced I/M programs for the following urbanized areas:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements
for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience;
vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic
inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance;
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector
training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness;
compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. For enhanced I/M
programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from an existing test-and-repair
network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and
after referred to as the ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her
designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation;
and (2) a schedule for adoption of the program with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory or
other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was
justified by the fact that States could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements
of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November
5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including
the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was required to be submitted no later than November 15,
1993.

B. I/M Program in California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. California Committal SIP: The State of California submitted an I/M committal SIP on November 13, 1992. The committal
SIP submittal became complete by operation of law under section 110(k)(1)(B) on May 13, 1993. The submittal includes
a letter from the Executive Officer of the CARB and a copy of Resolution 92&hyph;74 which was adopted at a public hearing
held by the CARB on November 13, 1992. The Resolution directs the Executive Officer to submit the committal letter
to EPA as a revision to the SIP. The submittal included a commitment by the governor's designee, the CARB Executive
Officer, to the timely adoption and implementation of I/M programs meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation
and the Act in all nonattainment areas in California where these programs are required. A schedule of adoption was
included in a letter sent by the CARB Executive Officer to EPA on January 15, 1993 clarifying certain details of the
November 13, 1992 I/M committal SIP submittal. In the schedule California committed to passing legislation authorizing
an I/M program by September 10, 1993. The committal SIP lists October 10, 1993 as the deadline for the legislation to
be signed by the governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPA Proposed Approval: On June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34553) EPA proposed to conditionally approve the committal SIP under
section 110(k)(4) of the Act. In the alternative, however, EPA proposed that, if the State failed to adopt legislative
authority or meet certain other applicable interim milestones in the commitment prior to EPA's final action on the
submittal, EPA would disapprove the committal SIP. The basis for such disapproval would be a determination that California
could not meet the November 15, 1993 SIP revision submission date if it failed to meet the interim milestones. Therefore,
since the State could not meet its commitment, final approval under section 110(k)(4) would not be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. State Legislative Action: On November 15, 1993 California failed to meet its commitment to EPA. By letter dated
December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 notified the State that the proposed SIP revision submitted on November 15, 1993, did
not contain the critical elements required by statute and that the State had failed to submit a complete SIP revision
as required by the Act. For example, the proposed SIP revision did not contain legislative authority for the State
to implement the proposed SIP revision. In addition, EPA Region 9 notified the State that the proposed SIP revision
was an incomplete SIP submittal because it was not subject to a public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the State failed to meet the interim deadlines in its committal SIP. California was required to obtain legislative
authority for the adoption and implementation of an enhanced I/M program during the 1993 legislative session under
the November 15, 1992 I/M committal SIP submittal. Bills to change California's existing I/M program were introduced
during the 1993 legislative session and hearings were held by the Senate and Assembly Transportation Committees.
The legislature adjourned, however, on September 10, 1993 without having adopted I/M legislation. Failure to provide
such authority prevented California from submitting a complete SIP revision by November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earlier this year, EPA anticipated the possibility that the California legislature would fail to adopt necessary
legislation during the 1993 legislative session. On April 13, 1993, EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation
sent a joint letter to Governor Wilson advising him that EPA would exercise its discretionary authority under section
110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions if the legislature failed to adopt adequate legislation. On November 24, 1993,
EPA issued a press statement indicating that EPA would temporarily halt the process of imposing sanctions to permit
discussions between the parties to resolve the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Importance of Timely Implementation of Appropriate I/M Programs: Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, enhanced
I/M programs play an important role in the ability of California areas to comply with the CAA requirements for achieving
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and CO, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable
further progress (RFP) reductions for ozone. The Act provides that each state in which all or part of an ozone and/or
CO nonattainment area are located is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised,
will provide for attainment of the ozone and/or CO NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires
that each state in which all or part of a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit
SIP revisions that will reduce VOC emissions by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of the 1990 baseline emissions. If
the reductions identified in the SIP revisions are less than 15% of the baseline emissions, the State may obtain a waiver
under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii); this requires the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the
plan reflecting the lesser amount includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological
achievability. Many areas in California will have difficulty meeting the RFP requirements because credit for certain
pre-1990 CAA programs, such as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M, is not allowed. The additional
benefits of enhanced I/M, however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. Enhanced I/M is one
of the most powerful tools available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both VOC and NOx, both
of which are treated in most California plans as precursors of ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a federally approvable enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality control
strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone and CO air quality standard is virtually
impossible. Without appropriate enabling legislation, an enhanced I/M program cannot be implemented.

II. Sanctions Under the Clean Air Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This sanction action is being proposed under EPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the Act.
The predicate findings and types of sanctions are described in section 179 of the Act. The two sanctions available
to EPA for application under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of
certain highway projects; and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary
sources. The highway funding sanction prohibits approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the
awarding by the Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and
certain other categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when States
apply the emission offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions
to increased emissions must be at least 2 to 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which provide EPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section
179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP,
or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) EPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required
by the Act; (3) a State has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet
the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by EPA for not meeting the Act's requirements;
or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(a), unless the State corrects the deficiency, one of the two sanctions listed in section 179(b)
must be imposed 18 months after a finding is made, and the second must be imposed 6 months after the first sanction is
imposed if the deficiency remains uncorrected.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, both sanctions shall apply after 18 months if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of
the State.

On October 1, 1993, EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179 of the
Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanctions apply first and the highway sanctions apply second. According
to the proposed rule, EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice and comment rulemaking.
This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does not govern
sanctions imposed under section 110(m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after
a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides EPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at any
time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179 are
limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes EPA to apply discretionary sanctions to any portion
of the state that EPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are met. See 57 FR 44534,
44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires EPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that such sanctions are not
applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan
are principally responsible for the deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 28, 1992, EPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions
to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These
proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to California, EPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 based on California's failure to adopt legislation to improve its I/M program. EPA is taking this action for two reasons:
(1) Congress required timely submittal of enhanced I/M programs as a measure central to allowing the State's metropolitan
areas to meet CAA deadlines, and any legislative delay threatens the States's ability to meet those deadlines, and
(2) enhanced I/M is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval
of an acceptable I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial
sources_additional burdens which are especially problematic given California's current economic difficulties.

EPA issued its letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the state's proposed SIP revision was a failure to submit a
SIP revision as required by the Act and, in addition, was an incomplete SIP submittal. Mandatory sanctions were triggered
under Section 179(a) by issuance of the letter notifying the state of the finding of deficiency.

III. Proposed Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Finding Under Section 179(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, on December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 issued a letter notifying the state of its failure to submit
a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. EPA's letter constitutes a finding under section
179(a) that triggers EPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section
110(m). Further, on June 28, 1993, EPA proposed to conditionally approve California's I/M committal SIP for both
basic and enhanced I/M programs. EPA also proposed, in the alternative, to disapprove this commitment if the state
failed to adopt authorizing legislation and to submit the required I/M programs by the November 15, 1993 date. California
has also now failed to adopt and submit such programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If sufficient progress has not been made by California toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be
operational on or before January 1, 1995, EPA hereby announces its intention to impose sanctions on May 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) of the Act allows EPA to apply the highway and offset sanctions at any time (or at any time after) it makes
a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated December 30, 1993, EPA is proposing to impose both the highway
and offset sanctions. EPA believes that the imposition of highway sanctions is appropriate because of California's
failure to adopt legislation to enhance its existing smog check program. In the absence of improved smog check, the
ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the Clean Air Act deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is
severely compromised. As previously noted, enhanced smog check is the single most effective air pollution control
measures available and delayed legislative approval of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial
sources of air pollution with responsibility for cleaning the air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 110(m), EPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate.
During the 24 months following the finding, EPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions
within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. EPA has proposed criteria
for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992). The criteria
provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to perform the
required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform, the
required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding, from
the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked that agreement), or is
required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform
the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for
adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by,
or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, EPA may use its discretion to
determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice, EPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose the highway sanction
statewide for California because of the State's failure to submit a complete SIP revision complying with the I/M committal
SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the California legislature
has the authority to revise the state statute to provide for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements.
Once the legislature has acted, only state government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual
air pollution control district or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program
once adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program through
legislation and regulations. Since the state legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide the
legal authority for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements, an enhanced I/M program is not available
to areas within the state that require the program.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since no political subdivision within the state has met the first criterion, EPA believes that no political subdivision
is principally responsible for the failure to have an enhanced I/M program. Therefore, EPA is not prohibited from
imposing highway sanctions statewide. As noted above, the state legislature bears the ultimate responsibility
to adopt the requisite legislative authority and CARB, not the individual air quality districts, must subsequently
adopt adequate regulations. Since the state bears ultimate responsibility, EPA believes that it is reasonable and
appropriate to impose sanctions on the entire State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The offset requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located in or to be located in areas
that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, the offset sanctions are limited to those
areas which are required to have a permit program, i.e., the ozone and CO nonattainment areas. For ozone, those areas
are: Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast, Ventura, Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley,
and the South East Desert. The offset sanction would apply to all new or modified major stationary sources for VOCs
and NOx that are locating to or located in each of these areas and for such sources of CO that are located in or locating
to the following CO nonattainment areas: Chico, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Joaquin, and South Coast.
EPA proposes to impose the offset sanctions in the manner described in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions
(58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (October 1, 1993)).

C. Removal of Discretionary Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to temporarily lift (i.e., toll)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the highway and offset sanctions imposed under section 110(m) upon passage by the California legislature and signature
by the Governor of legislation which EPA preliminarily determines provides legal authority for an enhanced I/M program
meeting the requirements of the CAA and the I/M regulation. EPA proposes to notify the state of this tolling by a letter
to the Governor and the public by a notice published in the notice section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 110(m) sanctions would not be completely lifted until the State makes a complete submittal of its enhanced
I/M program for the State of California. EPA will take action to completely lift section 110(m) sanctions at the time
it determines the State's submittal to be complete or it is deemed complete. A complete submittal is one that contains
all the critical elements listed in the I/M regulation as determined through the completeness criteria in section
110(k)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general rule, an Agency must go through rulemaking to remove or alter a requirement imposed through rulemaking.
While U.S. EPA intends to issue a notice tolling the 110(m) sanction upon the occurrence of the events described, U.S.
EPA will use the good cause exception to the otherwise applicable requirement for proposed rulemaking. EPA believes
there is good cause to toll the sanctions once the state takes the action which cures the defficiency that resulted
in the imposition of sanctions. See 5 U.S.C.&sect;553(b)(B). Therefore, no proposed action for removal will be issued.
Consistent with U.S. EPA's intent to impose discretionary sanctions only on those areas that lack legislative authority,
EPA believes that it is in the public interest to remove, at least temporarily, these discretionary sanctions as expeditiously
as possible once the State of California has enacted legislative authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, if EPA takes final action disapproving California's committal SIP prior to taking final action
imposing sanctions, EPA proposes that such disapproval be the basis for imposing the discretionary sanctions. In
such case, the sanctions would be tolled in the same manner; however, if the disapproval is the final basis for imposing
the sanctions, such sanctions would not be completely lifted until EPA formally approves an enhanced I/M program
for the State of California. In such a case, EPA would take action to lift the sanctions at the same time as EPA took final
action approving the State's I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's action imposing or tolling the section 110(m) sanctions will in no manner affect EPA's obligation to impose
mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) where one mandatory sanction shall apply 18 months after EPA's finding
of incompleteness and the second mandatory sanction shall apply 6 months later. Sanctions under section 179(a) apply
to the area for which the deficiency exists. If the State does not adopt and submit to EPA a complete submittal providing
for an I/M program within the 18-month and additional 6-month periods, the sanctions will automatically apply to
those areas of the state that were required to have but do not have such a complete I/M program under the amended Act.
See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993). Moreover, if EPA takes final action disapproving California's I/M committal SIP,
a second sanctions clock will be triggered and California must not only submit an I/M program, but EPA must also approve
that program within the relevant time frames to stop the mandatory sanctions clock and avoid sanctions on the final
disapproval.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action''. Nevertheless after reviewing information regarding this action, OMB has waived review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA cannot reliably predict the impact of these restrictions because of the exemptions authorized for certain highway
projects related to mass transit, public safety, and those that have beneficial air quality impacts. Careful review
and evaluation of each project is necessary to determine whether or not a project is exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA takes final action on this proposal, the 2 to 1 emissions offset requirement will apply to major new sources and
major modifications to the existing sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon
monoxide (CO) in the California ozone and carbon monoxide areas subject to section 173(c) offset requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major stationary sources of VOC, NOX, and CO are generally not small entities. Also, the 2 to 1 emission offset requirement
does not prevent growth and modification but sets a higher offset standard than the current offset required. It is
not expected that a large number of small entities will be affected by the emission offset requirement. In the past,
when EPA has made efforts to quantify the impact of the Act's rules on the construction and modification of sources,
EPA has been unable to do so due, in part, to the need to obtain information on future plans for business growth. This
information is difficult to obtain, as business are understandably reluctant to make their plans public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to impose Federal highway funding assistance limitations statewide. This limitation could affect
a number of government entities with populations of less than 50,000 since government entities often apply for and
receive federal funding under Title 23, United States Code, for road improvement projects. Although a great many
projects are exempted under section 179(b)(1)(B), a number of projects are expected to be affected if EPA takes final
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, EPA cannot further analyze the economic impacts of this action on small entities. The
statements in this package constitute EPA's full regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Should the highway sanctions become effective, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
is required to determine which projects or grants should not be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are
exempt. This determination will be based on information readily available in existing documentation gathered for
the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different alternatives for transportation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects. These analyses are already required for the preparation of environmental assessments and impact statements
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, exemption determinations by USDOT for sanctions have been based on such NEPA documentation and have
not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis by the States. In addition, since under NEPA final
environmental documents must be approved by USDOT, in most cases the NEPA documentation will already be in USDOT's
possession. Therefore, EPA does not believe that the highway sanction, when applied, will impose an additional information
collection burden on the states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under the section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from
between 1 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 (depending on the classification of the nonattainment area in which they are located). Should
the offset sanction apply, it would not impose an additional information collection burden because sources will
not have to provide additional information in the application beyond that which they would already have to provide
in the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended Act for nonattainment
new source review (NSR) and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being
prepared to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.)

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on Illinois under
the discretionary authority provided to the Agency under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure
by the State to meet its commitment to adopt a basic and enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program
as required by the Act for certain ozone nonattainment areas. On November 11, 1992, the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment to adopt (Committal SIP) an I/M program
to meet the requirements of the Act and the I/M rule by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption
and implementation of a basic and enhanced I/M program meeting all requirements of US EPA's I/M regulations and includes
an implementation schedule. On December 2, 1993, US EPA proposed to disapprove this SIP revision based on the failure
by the State to meet milestones contained in the committal SIP's implementation schedule pertaining to the enactment
of necessary legislative authority. A full SIP revision including State legislative authority to implement the
program was required by November 15, 1993. The Illinois General Assembly adjourned on November 4, 1993, for the second
time this year without taking necessary action to provide for implementation of the basic and enhanced I/M programs.

On December 30, 1993, EPA Region 5 issued a letter finding that the State had failed to submit the SIP revision required
under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either
the requirements of the Act and its commitment to adopt and implement the required I/M programs as promised in its committal
SIP, USEPA proposes to exercise its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation
sanction and a 2 for 1 growth offset sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review
provision of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act, vehicle I/M programs were mandated for certain areas with long standing
air quality problems. The 1990 amendments to the Act expanded the role of I/M programs as an attainment strategy and
required USEPA to develop different performance standards for ``basic'' and ``enhanced'' I/M programs. The performance
standard is the minimum amount of emission reductions a program must achieve, based on a model or benchmark program
design. In addition, the amended Act directed USEPA to address requirements for specific design elements and program
implementation issues for both basic and enhanced I/M programs. The amended Act requires states containing nonattainment
areas to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed
USEPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's
audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires each area required by the Act to have an I/M program
to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, USEPA promulgated an I/M regulation on November
5, 1992. (57 FR 52950) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 182(c)(3) of the Act, areas designated as serious or worse ozone nonattainment areas with 1980 populations
of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast
ozone transport region, are required to meet USEPA requirements for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These areas were
required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an I/M program by November 15, 1992. In Illinois, the State must implement
I/M programs in the urbanized areas of the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements
for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience;
vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic
inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance;
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector
training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness;
compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from
an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January
1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Each state required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and
after referred to as the ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her
designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation;
and (2) a schedule for adoption of the program, with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory or
other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was
justified by the fact that states could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements
of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November
5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including
the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was to be submitted no later than November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 11, 1992, the State of Illinois submitted a committal SIP to USEPA. A public hearing on this submittal was
held by the State on October 27, 1992, in Springfield, Illinois. The submittal included a schedule of implementation
and a commitment to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program in the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone
nonattainment areas meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation and the amended Act by November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1993, the Illinois General Assembly adjourned without taking the necessary action to enable Illinois
to adopt and implement the I/M provisions mandated by the amended Act and the final I/M rule in Chicago and East St. Louis
ozone nonattainment areas. Failure to provide such authority prevented the State from submitting a complete SIP
revision containing all the required elements of the program by November 15, 1993. On September 28, 1993, USEPA sent
a letter to Illinois Governor Edgar advising him that USEPA had decided to exercise its discretionary authority under
section 110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions at any time once a finding of SIP deficiency is made if necessary legislation
was not adopted during the October 1993 veto session of the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois General Assembly
reconvened on October 12, 1993, for the fall veto session. During this session which adjourned November 4, 1993, the
legislature failed for the second time to enact the legislation needed to implement the required I/M program meeting
the requirements of the Act in the State of Illinois. After review of the committal SIP, USEPA proposed to disapprove
the commitment on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63547), based on the failure by the State to meet interim and final milestones
in the schedule contained in the SIP submittal pertaining to the enactment of necessary authority to implement I/M
requirements during the 1993 Illinois General Legislative session. On November 15, 1993, the State of Illinois failed
to meet its commitment to USEPA by failing to submit a full SIP revision for I/M program implementation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, I/M programs play an important role in the ability of the Chicago and East
St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas to comply with the requirements of the Act for achieving the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable further progress (RFP)
reductions for ozone. The Act provides that each state in which all or part of certain classifications for ozone nonattainment
areas are located is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised, will provide
for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires that each state in
which all or part of a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit SIP revisions that
will reduce VOC emissions by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of the 1990 baseline emissions. If the reductions identified
in the SIP revisions are less than 15% of baseline emissions, the State may obtain a waiver under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii);
this requires the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the plan reflecting the lesser amount
includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological achievability. The Chicago
and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas in Illinois will have difficulty meeting the applicable RFP requirements
because credit for certain pre-1990 CAA programs, such as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M
is not allowed. The additional benefits resulting from implementing an I/M program that meets the requirements of
the final November 5, 1992, I/M regulation, however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. An
I/M program is one of the most powerful tools available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both
VOC and NOx, both of which are precursors of ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a federally approvable basic and enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality
control strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone air quality standard is
virtually impossible, and without appropriate enabling legislation, an I/M program meeting final USEPA I/M regulations
cannot be implemented.

II. Sanctions Under the Clean Air Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This sanction action is being proposed under USEPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the
Act. The predicate findings and types of sanctions are in section 179. The two sanctions available to USEPA for application
under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of certain highway projects;
and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary sources. The highway
funding sanction prohibits the approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the awarding by the
Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and certain other
categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when states apply the emission
offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions
must be at least 2 to 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which provide USEPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section
179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of the SIP,
or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) USEPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required
by the Act; (3) a state has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet
the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by USEPA for not meeting the Act's
requirements; or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

On October 1, 1993, U.S. EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179
of the Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanction apply first and the highway funding sanction apply
second. According to the proposed rule, U.S. EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice-and-comment
rulemaking. This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does
not govern sanctions imposed under section 110(m).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after
a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides USEPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at
any time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179
are limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes USEPA to apply discretionary sanctions to
any portion of the state that USEPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are
met. See 57 FR 44534, 44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires USEPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that
such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable
implementation plan are principally responsible for the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 28, 1992, USEPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions
to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These
proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Illinois, USEPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 based on Illinois' failure to submit a complete I/M program. USEPA is taking this action for two reasons: (1) Congress
required timely submittal of I/M programs as a measure central to allowing the State's metropolitan areas to meet
CAA deadlines and any legislative delay threatens the State's ability to meet those deadlines, and (2) enhanced I/M
is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval of an acceptable
I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial sources.

U.S. EPA issued a letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the state's failed to submit a SIP revision as required by

the finding of the deficiency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, on December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter notifying the State of its failure to submit
a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. USEPA's letter constitutes a finding under section
179(a) that triggers EPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section
110(m). Further, on December 2, 1993, USEPA proposed to disapprove the I/M committal SIP containing Illinois' commitment
to adopt and submit both basic and enhanced I/M programs meeting the requirements of the Act and USEPA's I/M regulation
by November 15, 1993. Illinois has now failed to adopt and submit such programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If sufficient progress has not been made by Illinois toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be operational
on or before January 1, 1995, EPA hereby announces its intention to impose sanctions on May 15, 1994.

B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) of the Act allows USEPA to apply the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and the 2:1 emission
offset sanction at any time (or at any time after) it makes a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated
December 30, 1993, USEPA is proposing to impose both the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission
offset sanctions. USEPA believes that the imposition of both sanctions is appropriate because of Illinois' failure
to submit a complete SIP revision to enhance its existing vehicle I/M program. In the absence of improved vehicle I/M,
the ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the CAA deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is severely
compromised. As previously noted, I/M programs are the single most effective air pollution control measures available
and delayed legislative approval of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial sources of air pollution
with responsibility for cleaning the air.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 110(m), USEPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate.
During the 24 months following the finding, USEPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions
within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. USEPA has proposed
criteria for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992).
The criteria provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to
perform the required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform,
the required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding,
from the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked the agreement), or
is required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform
the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for
adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by,
or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, USEPA may use its discretion
to determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice, USEPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose sanctions statewide
for Illinois because of the failure to comply with the I/M committal SIP revision adopting an I/M program. USEPA believes
that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the Illinois General Assembly, composed
of representatives from all portions of the State of Illinois, has the authority to revise the state statute to provide
for a basic and enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and USEPA requirements. Once the legislature has acted, only state
government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual air pollution control districts
or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program within their districts once
that program is adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program
through legislation and regulations. Since the State legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide
the legal authority for an 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
I/M program meeting the CAA and USEPA requirements an I/M program meeting such requirements is not available to areas
within the State that require the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no political subdivision within the State has met the first criterion, USEPA believes that no political subdivision
is principally responsible for the failure to have an I/M program that meets final USEPA regulations. Therefore,
USEPA is not prohibited from imposing sanctions statewide. As noted above, the State legislature bears the ultimate
responsibility to adopt the requisite legislative authority and IEPA, not the individual air quality districts,
must subsequently adopt adequate regulations. Since the State does bear the ultimate responsibility, USEPA believes
that it is reasonable and appropriate for USEPA to impose the highway sanction on the entire State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 2:1 offset sanction requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located in or to be located
in areas that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, USEPA is proposing to impose the 2:1
emission offset sanction only in those areas in which it will have an effect, i.e., the following ozone nonattainment
counties: Cook, Lake, Kane, DuPage, Will, McHenry, Madison, Monroe, St. Clair, Grundy (Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships
only), and Kendall (Oswego Township only). The 2:1 emission offset would apply to all new or modified major stationary
sources of VOC and NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that are locating to or located in each of these areas. USEPA proposes to impose the offset sanctions in the manner described
in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions (58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (October 1, 1993)).

USEPA is proposing to temporarily lift (i.e., toll)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the highway and offset sanctions imposed under section 110(m) upon the passage by the Illinois General Assembly and
signature by the Governor of legislation which USEPA preliminary determines provides legal authority for a basic
and enhanced I/M program meeting the requirements of the CAA and the I/M regulations. USEPA proposes to notify the
State of this tolling by a letter to the Governor and the public by a notice published in the notice section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 110(m) sanctions would not be completely lifted until the State submits a complete enhanced I/M program.
USEPA will take action to completely lift section 110(m) sanctions upon a determination that the State has submitted
a complete enhanced I/M program.

 As a general rule, an Agency must go through rulemaking to remove or alter a requirement imposed through rulemaking.
While USEPA intends to issue a notice tolling the 110(m) sanctions upon the occurrence of the events described, USEPA
will use the good cause exception to the otherwise applicable requirement for proposed rulemaking. EPA believes
there is good cause to toll the sanctions once the state takes the action which cures the deficiency that resulted in
imposition of sanctions. See 5 U.S.C. &sect;553(b)(B). Therefore, no proposed action for removal will be issued.
Consistent with USEPA's intent to impose discretionary sanctions only on those areas that lack legislative authority,
USEPA believes that it is in the public interest to remove, at least temporarily, these discretionary sanctions as
expeditiously as possible once the State of Illinois has enacted legislative authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, if EPA takes final action disapproving Illinois's committal SIP prior to taking final action imposing
sanctions, EPA proposes that such disapproval be the basis for imposing the discretionary sanctions. In such case,
the sanctions would be tolled in the same manner; however, if the disapproval is the final basis for imposing the sanctions
such sanctions would not be completely lifted until EPA formally approves an enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
I/M program for the State of Illinois. In such a case, EPA would take action to lift the sanctions at the same time as EPA
took final action approving the State's I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA's action imposing or tolling the section 110(m) sanctions will in no manner affect USEPA's obligation to impose
mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) where one mandatory sanction shall apply 18 months after USEPA's finding
of failure to submit a complete SIP and the second mandatory sanction shall apply 6 months later. Sanctions under section
179(a) apply to the areas for which the deficiency exists. If the State does not adopt and submit to USEPA a complete
submittal providing for an I/M program within the 18-month and additional 6-month periods, the sanctions will automatically
apply on those areas of the State that were required to have but do not have such a complete I/M program under the amended
Act. See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993). Moreover, if EPA takes final action disapproving Illinois's I/M committal
SIP, a second sanctions clock will be triggered and Illinois must not only submit an I/M program, but EPA must also approve
that program within the relevant time frames to stop the mandatory sanctions clock and avoid sanctions based on the
final disapproval.

IV. Regulatory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely effect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' Nevertheless, after reviewing information regarding this action, OMB has waived review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA cannot reliably predict the impact of these restrictions because of the exemptions authorized for certain
highway projects related to mass transit, public safety, and those that have beneficial air quality impacts. Careful
review and evaluation of each project is necessary to determine whether or not a project is exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If USEPA takes final action on this proposal, the 2:1 emission offset requirement will apply to major new sources and
major modifications to existing sources of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in the Illinois ozone areas subject to the section 173 offset requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major stationary sources of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with emissions are generally not small entities. Also, the 2:1 emission offset requirement does not prevent growth
and modification but sets a higher offset standard than the current offset required. It is not expected that a large
number of small entities will be affected by the emission offset requirement. In the past, when USEPA has made efforts
to quantify the impact of the Act's rules on the construction and modification of sources, USEPA has been unable to
do so due, in part, to the need to obtain information on future plans for business growth. This information is difficult
to obtain, as businesses are understandably reluctant to make their plans public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA is also proposing to impose Federal highway funding assistance limitations statewide. This limitation
could affect a number of government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000 since government
entities often apply for and receive federal funding under Title 23, United States Code, for road improvement projects.
Although a great many projects are exempted under section 179(b)(1)(B), a number of projects are expected to be affected
if the USEPA takes final action. For the reasons stated above, USEPA cannot further analyze the economic impacts of
this action on small entities. The statements in this package constitute USEPA's full regulatory Flexibility analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Should the highway sanctions become effective, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
is required to determine which projects or grants should not be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are
exempt. This determination will be based on information readily available in existing documentation gathered for
the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different alternatives for transportation
projects. These analyses are already required for the preparation of environmental assessments and impact statements
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Historically, exemption determinations by USDOT for sanctions
have been based on such NEPA documentation and have not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis
by the states. In addition, since under NEPA, final environmental documents must be approved by USDOT, in most cases
the NEPA documentation will already be in USDOT's possession. Therefore, USEPA does not believe that the highway
sanctions, when applied, will impose an additional information collection burden on the states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from between
1 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 (depending on the classification of the nonattainment area in which they are located). Should the
offset sanction apply, it would not impose an additional information collection burden because sources will not
have to provide additional information in the application beyond that which they would already have to provide in
the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended Act for nonattainment
new source review and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being prepared
to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.)

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on Indiana under the
discretionary sanction authority provided under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure by
the State to submit a complete SIP revision for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program
as required by the Act for certain ozone nonattainment areas. On December 2, 1992, the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment (Committal SIP) to adopt an I/M program
to meet the requirement of the Act and the I/M rule by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption
and implementation of an enhanced I/M program meeting all requirements of USEPA's I/M regulations and includes an
implementation schedule. On September 9, 1993, USEPA proposed to disapprove this SIP revision and on November 29,
1993, USEPA disapproved this SIP revision based on the failure by the State to meet milestones contained in the committal
SIP's implementation schedule pertaining to the enactment of necessary legislative authority. A full SIP revision
including State legislative authority to implement the program was required by November 15, 1993. The Indiana legislature
adjourned on June 30, 1993, without taking necessary action to provide for implementation of an enhanced I/M program.
On December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter finding that the State had failed to submit the SIP revision required
under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either
the requirements of the Act or its commitment to adopt and implement an enhanced I/M program as promised in its committal
SIP, USEPA proposes to exercise its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation
sanction and a 2 for 1 growth offset sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review
provisions of the Act.

I. I/M Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act, vehicle I/M programs were mandated for certain areas with long standing
air quality problems. The 1990 amendments to the Act expanded the role of I/M programs as an attainment strategy and
required USEPA to develop different performance standards for ``basic'' and ``enhanced'' I/M programs. The performance
standard is the minimum amount of emission reductions a program must achieve, based on a model or benchmark program
design. In addition, the amended Act directed USEPA to address requirements for specific design elements and program
implementation issues for both basic and enhanced I/M programs. The amended Act requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states containing nonattainment areas to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section
182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed USEPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration
findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires each area
required by the Act to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, USEPA
promulgated an I/M regulation on November 5, 1992. (57 FR 52950) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 182(c)(3) of the Act, areas designated as serious or worse ozone nonattainment areas with populations
of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast
ozone transport region, are required to meet USEPA requirements for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These areas were
required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an enhanced I/M program by November 15, 1992. In Indiana, the State
must implement a basic I/M program in the urbanized areas of Clark and Floyd counties; it must implement an enhanced
I/M program in the urbanized areas of Lake and Porter counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements
for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience;
vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic
inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance;
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector
training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness;
compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from
an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January
1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each state required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and
after referred to as ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her
designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation;
and, (2) a schedule for adoption of the program, with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory
or other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was
justified by the fact that states could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements
of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November
5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including
the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was to be submitted no later than November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 2, 1992, the State of Indiana submitted a committal SIP to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA. A public hearing on this submittal was held by the State on October 22, 1992, in Gary, Indiana. The submittal
included a schedule of implementation and a commitment to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program
in the Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd County ozone nonattainment areas meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation
and the amended Act by November 15, 1993.

On June 30, 1993, the Indiana legislature adjourned without taking the necessary action to enable Indiana to adopt
and implement the I/M provisions mandated by the amended Act and the final I/M rule in Lake and Porter Counties. Failure
to provide such authority prevented the State from submitting a complete SIP revision containing all the required
elements of the program by November 15, 1993. On August 17, 1993, USEPA sent a letter to Governor Bayh of Indiana and
to the Regional Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration advising them that USEPA had decided to exercise
its discretionary authority under section 110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions at any time once a finding of SIP deficiency
is made. After review of the committal SIP, USEPA proposed to disapprove the commitment on September 9, 1993 (58 FR
47415), and on November 29, 1993 USEPA disapproved this SIP revision based on the failure by the State to meet interim
and final milestones in the schedule contained in the SIP submittal pertaining to the enactment of necessary authority
to implement I/M requirements during the 1993 Indiana General Legislative session. On November 15, 1993, the State
of Indiana failed to meet its commitment to USEPA by failing to submit a full SIP revision for I/M program implementation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, enhanced I/M programs play an important role in the ability of Lake and Porter
Counties to comply with the CAA requirements for achieving the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
ozone, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable further progress (RFP) reductions for ozone. The Act provides
that each state in which all or part of certain classifications for ozone and/or CO nonattainment areas are located
is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised, will provide for attainment
of the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires that each state in which all or part of a
serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit SIP revisions that will reduce VOC emissions
by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of 1990 baseline emissions. If the reductions identified in the SIP revisions are
less than 15% of baseline emissions, the state may obtain a waiver under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii); this requires
the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the plan reflecting the lesser amount includes all measures
that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological achievability. The Lake and Porter areas in
Indiana will have difficulty meeting the RFP requirements because credit for certain pre-1990 CAA programs, such
as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M is not allowed. The additional benefits of enhanced I/M,
however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. Enhanced I/M is one of the most powerful tools
available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both VOC and NOx, both of which are precursors of
ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a federally approvable enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality control
strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone air quality standard is virtually
impossible, and without appropriate enabling legislation, an enhanced I/M program cannot be implemented.

This sanction action is being proposed under USEPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the
Act. The predicate findings and types of sanctions are in section 179. The two sanctions available to USEPA for application
under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of certain highway projects;
and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary sources. The highway
funding sanction prohibits the approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the awarding by the
Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and certain other
categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when states apply the emission
offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions
must be at least 2 to 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which provide USEPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section
179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of the SIP,
or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) USEPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required
by the Act; (3) a state has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet
the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by USEPA for not meeting the Act's
requirements; or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

Under section 179(a), unless the state corrects the deficiency, one of the two sanctions listed in section 179(b)
must be imposed 18 months after a finding is made, and the second must be imposed 6 months after the first sanction is
imposed, if the deficiency remains uncorrected.

 In addition, USEPA may apply both sanctions after 18 months if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part

On October 1, 1993, U.S. EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179
of the Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanction apply first and the highway funding sanction apply
second. According to the proposed rule, U.S. EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice-and-comment
rulemaking. This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does
not govern sanctions imposed under section 110(m).

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after
a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides USEPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at
any time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179
are limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes USEPA to apply discretionary sanctions to
any portion of the state that USEPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are
met. See 57 FR 44534, 44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires USEPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that
such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable
implementation plan are principally responsible for the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 28, 1992, USEPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions
to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These
proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Indiana, EPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 based on Indiana's failure to submit a complete SIP to improve its I/M program. EPA is taking this action for two reasons:
(1) Congress required timely submittal of enhanced I/M programs as a measure the State's metropolitan areas to meet
CAA deadlines, and any legislative delay threatens the State's ability to meet those deadlines, and (2) enhanced
I/M is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval of an acceptable
I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial sources.

U.S. EPA issued a letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the State's proposed SIP revision was a failure to submit
a SIP revision as required by the Act. Mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) were triggered by issuance of the letter
notifying the State of the finding of the deficiency.

As stated previously on December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter notifying the State of its failure to submit
a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. USEPA's letter constitutes a finding under section
179(a) that triggers USEPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section
110(m). Further, on November 29, 1993, USEPA disapproved Indiana's committal SIP revision because the State had
failed to meet its commitment.

B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) of the Act allows USEPA to apply the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission
offset sanction at any time (or at any time after) it makes a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated
December 30, 1993, USEPA is proposing to impose both the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission
offset sanctions. USEPA believes that the imposition of both sanctions is appropriate because of Indiana's failure
to adopt legislation to enhance its existing vehicle inspection and maintenance program. In the absence of an improved
vehicle inspection and maintenance program, the ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the Clean Air Act
deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is severely compromised. As previously noted, enhanced vehicle inspection
and maintenance is the single most effective air pollution control measure available and delayed legislative approval
of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial sources of air pollution with responsibility for cleaning
the air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 110(m), USEPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate.
During the 24 months following the finding, USEPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions
within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. USEPA has proposed
criteria for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992).
The criteria provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to
perform the required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform,
the required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding,
from the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked the agreement), or
is required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform
the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for
adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by,
or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, USEPA may use its discretion
to determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice, USEPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose highway sanction
statewide for Indiana because of the failure to submit a complete enhanced I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA believes that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the Indiana legislature,
composed of representatives from all portions of the State of Indiana, has the authority to revise the state statute
to provide for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements. Once the legislature has acted, only state
government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual air pollution control districts
or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program within their districts once
that program is adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program
through legislation and regulations. Since the State legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide
the legal authority for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and USEPA requirements, the program is not available
to areas within the State that require the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no political subdivision within the State has met the first criterion, EPA believes that no political subdivision
is principally responsible for the failure to have an enhanced I/M program. Therefore, EPA is not prohibited from
imposing sanctions statewide. As noted above, the State legislature bears the ultimate responsibility to adopt
the requisite legislative authority and IDEM, not the individual air quality districts, must subsequently adopt
adequate regulations. Since the State does bear the ultimate responsibility, USEPA believes that it is reasonable
and appropriate for USEPA to impose the highway sanction on the entire State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 2:1 offset sanction requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located or to be located
in areas that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, USEPA is proposing to impose the 2:1
emission offset sanction in the following ozone nonattainment counties: Lake, Porter, Clark, Floyd, Marion, St.
Joseph, Elkhart, and Vanderburgh. The 2:1 emission offset would apply to all new or modified major stationary sources
for volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen that are locating to or located in each of these areas. USEPA
proposes to impose the offset sanction in the manner described in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions
(58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (Oct. 1, 1993)).

 the highway and offset sanctions imposed under section 110(m) upon the passage by the Indiana legislature and signature
by the Governor of legislation which USEPA preliminary determines provides legal authority for an enhanced I/M program
meeting the requirements of the CAA and the I/M regulations. USEPA proposes to notify the State of this tolling by a
letter to the Governor and the public by a notice published in the notice section of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 110(m) sanctions would not be completely lifted until the State of Indiana submits a complete enhanced
I/M program to USEPA. USEPA will take action to completely lift section 110(m) sanctions upon its determination that
the State has submitted a complete enhanced I/M program.

 As a general rule, an Agency must go through rulemaking to remove or alter a requirement imposed through rulemaking.
While U.S. EPA intends to issue a notice tolling the 110(m) sanctions upon the occurrence of the events described,
U.S. EPA will use the good cause exception to the otherwise applicable requirement for proposed rulemaking. EPA believes
there is good cause to toll the sanctions once the state takes the action which cures the deficiency that resulted in
the imposition of sanctions. See 5 U.S.C. &sect;553(b)(B). Therefore, no proposed action for removal will be issued.
Consistent with U.S. EPA's intent to impose discretionary sanctions only on those areas that lack legislative authority
U.S. EPA believes that it is in the public interest to remove, at least temporarily, these discretionary sanctions
as expeditiously as possible once the State of Indiana has enacted legislative authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, EPA proposes that the basis for the discretionary sanctions is EPA's disapproval of Indiana's
committal SIP. If the EPA's disapproval of the committal SIP is the basis for the discretionary sanctions, such sanctions
would be tolled in the same manner as if the finding of failure to submit were the basis; however, if the disapproval
is the basis for imposing the sanctions such sanctions would not be completely lifted until EPA formally approves
an enhanced I/M program for the State of Indiana. In such a case, EPA would take action to lift the sanctions at the same
time as EPA took final action approving the State's I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA's action imposing or tolling the section 110(m) sanctions will in no manner affect EPA's obligation to impose
mandatory sanctions under section 179(a). The mandatory sanctions clock for Indiana was triggered on November 29,
1993 by EPA's disapproval of Indiana's committal SIP. Therefore, one mandatory sanction shall apply 18 months after
USEPA's final disapproval of the committal SIP and the second mandatory sanction shall apply 6 months later. Sanctions
under section 179(a) apply to the areas for which the deficiency exists and until such deficiency has been corrected.
Moreover, if the State does not adopt and USEPA does not approve regulations providing for an I/M program within the
18-month and additional 6-month periods following the effective date of EPA's disapproval, the sanctions will automatically
apply on those areas of the State that were required to have but do not have such a USEPA-approved I/M program under the
amended Act. See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993).

IV. Regulatory Requirements

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely effect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' Nevertheless, this action has been informally submitted to OMB for review.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. For reasons cited below, USEPA has not completed
a regulatory flexibility analysis for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA cannot reliably predict the impact of these restrictions because of the exemptions authorized for certain
highway projects related to mass transit, public safety, and those that have beneficial air quality impacts. Careful
review and evaluation of each project is necessary to determine whether or not a project is exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 with emissions are generally not small entities. Also, the 2:1 emission offset requirement does not prevent growth
and modification but sets a higher offset standard than the current offset required. It is not expected that a large
number of small entities will be affected by the emission offset requirement. In the past, when USEPA has made efforts
to quantify the impact of the Act's rules on the construction and modification of sources, USEPA has been unable to
do so due, in part, to the need to obtain information on future plans for business growth. This information is difficult
to obtain, as businesses are understandably reluctant to make their plans public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA is also proposing to impose Federal highway funding assistance limitations statewide. This limitation
could affect a number of government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000 since government
entities often apply for and receive federal funding under Title 23, United States Code, for road improvement projects.
Although a great many projects are exempted under section 179(b)(1)(B), a number of projects are expected to be affected
if the USEPA takes final action.

For the reasons stated above, EPA cannot further analyze the economic impacts of this action on small entities. The
statements in this package constitute EPA's full regulatory flexibility analysis.

C. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Should the highway sanctions become effective, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
is required to determine which projects or grants should not be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are
exempt. This determination will be based on information readily available in existing documentation gathered for
the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different alternatives for transportation
projects. These analyses are already required for the preparation of environmental assessments and impact statements
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Historically, exemption determinations by USDOT for sanctions
have been based on such NEPA documentation and have not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis
by the states. In addition, since under NEPA, final environmental documents must be approved by USDOT, in most cases
the NEPA documentation will already be in USDOT's possession. Therefore, USEPA does not believe that the highway
sanctions, when applied, will impose an additional information collection burden on the states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from between
1 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 (depending on the classification of the nonattainment area in which they are located). Should the
offset sanction apply, if would not impose an additional information collection burden because sources will not
have to provide additional information in the application beyond that which they would already have to provide in
the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended Act for nonattainment
new source review (NSR) and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being
prepared to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies.
The proposed regulations are needed to implement provisions added to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The purpose of the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies is to assure
that those agencies are, for HEA and other Federal purposes, reliable authorities as to the quality of education or
training offered by the institutions of higher education or higher education programs they accredit.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance (SFA)
programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must determine, in part,
that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the HEA
and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education
to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as
to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution
to be legally authorized to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located.
Thus, the statutory definition of an institution of higher education provides the framework for a shared responsibility
among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to SFA programs is opened
to only those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money
they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to as
``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the triad
has not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure educational quality, nor has it served as an effective deterrent
to abuse by institutions participating in SFA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For several years, certain institutions participating in SFA programs have failed to provide students with education
or training of an acceptable level of quality; they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, they have
failed to meet acceptable standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately
protect the SFA program funds entrusted to them. The institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are
not restricted to a particular sector of higher education. Rather, the abuses have been found in all types of institutions
participating in SFA programs, including those in the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education
as well as those in the proprietary sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies
have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs
they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit particular institutions or programs. Moreover,
some States have also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions
they authorize or license to operate in the State or to protect student interests. Finally, the Federal government's
management of its responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify institutions to participate in SFA programs
has not always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions that participate in SFA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, Congress amended the HEA to provide
for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under that part, States and accrediting agencies
are required to assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, accrediting associations, and the Secretary
are linked to create a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate or wish to participate
in the SFA programs. The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this coordinated evaluation of
institutions by the three components of the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its evaluation
on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education
or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility
for determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate within the State, the HEA added a new focus:
reviewing institutions that meet certain statutory review criteria. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of
institutions is the administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the SFA programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute allocates legal responsibility among the entities that compose the program integrity triad. While specific
statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together
in a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects of institutional review. Within this statutory
scheme, the Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system operates as efficiently as possible, with
maximum integration among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on postsecondary institutions.
In order to assist the Secretary in designing a final regulation that achieves these goals, the Secretary specifically
requests comment on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same
or similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency may establish different standards for evaluating
the financial responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of an institution's educational program.
Thus, a reviewed institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting agency's standards even though
those standards address the same areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce the burden on institutions
and enable the triad entities to carry out effectively their statutory functions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the final regulations be more explicit in identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any
of the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected to consider in its evaluation of an institution?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 1 of part H establishes a State Postsecondary Review Program under which each State designates a single State
postsecondary review entity that is responsible for reviewing institutions of higher education that the Secretary
identifies as meeting certain review criteria and for determining whether those institutions should continue to
participate in the SFA programs. Subpart 3 specifies the procedures the Secretary uses to determine whether an institution
meets the eligibility requirements and has the administrative capacity and financial responsibility to administer
the SFA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In subpart 2 of part H, the Secretary is charged with making a comprehensive and careful evaluation of an accrediting
agency before recognizing that agency as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training offered
by institutions or programs that the agency accredits. Moreover, as part of this evaluation, the Secretary is charged
with establishing recognition standards that must include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.''
Accordingly, the standards that the Secretary proposes in this notice of proposed rulemaking require an accrediting
agency to make a detailed and careful evaluation of the institutions or programs it accredits and to include in that
evaluation ``appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations were subject to the negotiated rulemaking process set forth in section 492 of the HEA.
Under that process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings in September, 1992 to obtain public involvement
in the development of these proposed regulations. The meetings were held in San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, and
Kansas City. Before convening the meetings, the Secretary held a meeting in Washington, DC in August 1992 to invite
comments from interested parties as to the key issues that should be addressed at the regional meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the four regional meetings, the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed in
these proposed regulations. A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals and groups who attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in the negotiated
rulemaking process. The Secretary selected negotiators from the list of nominees to reflect all the groups that are
involved in the SFA programs. With regard to these proposed regulations, the Secretary chose negotiators who reflected
the diversity of the accrediting community as well as the interests of States, higher education institutions, and
students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared a draft proposed regulation and negotiated the
provisions of that draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in January 1993 and one in February
1993. During those sessions, consensus was reached on several of the provisions that are included in this notice of
proposed rulemaking. On the remaining provisions, however, the negotiators agreed to disagree. Where agreement
was not reached on a particular provision, that fact is noted in the discussion that follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On several issues that were negotiated, there was general discussion on various approaches to take with regard to
those issues. The Secretary believes those issues are important enough to include in this preamble possible alternative
approaches in order to give the public a fuller understanding of the issues and the available potential solutions.
Finally, on most issues where consensus was reached, the negotiators also reached general agreement on the language
of a proposed regulatory provision. However, the Secretary wishes to reiterate the remarks of the Federal negotiators
that the agreed-to language with regard to a specific provision would be subject to change in the proposed regulations
for technical reasons but the substance of the provision would remain unchanged, wherever possible. Where a substantive
change was made in a particular provision, that fact is noted in the discussion that follows, and an explanation of
the reasons for the change is provided.

Significant Changes Proposed by the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion reflects proposed significant changes to the existing regulations governing the Secretary's
Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies. The changes are discussed in the order in which
they appear in the proposed regulations. If a provision applies to more than one section or is included in more than
one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate cross-reference to its other appearances.
The general format for the discussion of each section is to state the appropriate statutory provision for that section
and to explain any provisions that interpret or clarify the statute that the Secretary believes are necessary to implement
the statutory provision through regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these proposed regulations, the Secretary has regulated as little as possible. He has regulated narrowly
to the law, except where the Secretary deems further interpretation is necessary. In these cases, either the proposed
regulations include the specific language agreed to by negotiators during negotiated rulemaking, if an agreement
was reached, or the Secretary proposes language where agreement was not reached. In both cases, the Secretary solicits
comments on the clarifications and interpretations included in the proposed regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations permit the Secretary to recognize any accrediting agency the Secretary determines to be a reliable
authority as to the quality of postsecondary education or training provided by the institutions or programs it accredits.
However, section 496(m) of the HEA now authorizes the Secretary to recognize only those agencies that accredit institutions
of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling those institutions or programs to establish
eligibility to participate in programs administered either by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies. In &sect;602.1
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary reiterates the statutory provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the definitions included in the proposed regulations are self-explanatory. Three, however, warrant additional
comment based on the discussions that took place during the negotiated rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Institution of higher education. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed regulations, the Secretary defines an institution of higher education to be an educational institution
that qualifies or may qualify as an eligible institution under 34 CFR part 600, Institutional Eligibility under the
Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Some of the non-Federal negotiators, however, pointed out that it is not
clear that this definition includes certain types of hospitals and health care facilities. For this reason, the Secretary
wishes to make clear that a hospital or health care facility may qualify as an eligible institution of higher education
if the hospital or facility satisfies any definition of that term, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a ``public or nonprofit private institution of higher education,'' a ``proprietary institution of higher education,''
or a ``postsecondary vocational institution.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prebaccalaureate vocational education programs and vocational education programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.2, the Secretary proposes to define the term ``vocational education program'' based upon the statutory
provision included in the definition of various types of eligible institutions of higher education. Thus, the Secretary
defines a vocational education program as a program that ``prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized
occupation.'' (See, for example, section 481(b)(1) of the HEA for a ``proprietary institution of higher education;''
section 481(c)(1) for a ``postsecondary vocational institution;'' and the second sentence of section 1201(a) of
the HEA for a ``public and private nonprofit institution of higher education.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition, if read literally, could be viewed as including all postsecondary programs. To avoid this overreaching
conclusion, the Secretary proposes that the vocational education programs that trigger actions under these regulations
are prebaccalaureate vocational education programs. See, for example, &sect;602.24(c). This latter term is defined
as a vocational education program that leads to a certificate, degree, or other education credential that is less
than a bachelor's degree. The Secretary invites comment on these definitions, as well as alternative definitions,
in light of the fact that the non-Federal negotiators could not agree among themselves as to the acceptability of these
definitions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One alternative definition for prebaccalaureate vocational education that the Secretary is considering is ``undergraduate
vocational education that leads to a certificate or other educational credential but not to a degree.'' The Secretary
is considering this definition in order to ease the burden on institutions whose vocational education programs leading
to an associate degree would also trigger special action under the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this alternative definition were to be adopted, however, the Secretary is concerned that some institutions might
try to stretch their non-degree programs into associate-degree programs simply to avoid the additional requirements
that, as a result of these proposed regulations, accrediting agencies will have to impose on institutions that provide
prebaccalaureate vocational education. The Secretary invites comments on the alternative definition of prebaccalaureate
vocational education and suggestions for preventing unwarranted course or program stretching, should the alternative
definition be adopted. The Secretary also wishes to know if commenters believe there are other risks associated with
adopting the alternative definition that might outweigh any benefits derived by the degree-granting sector of the
higher education community through its adoption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the definition of ``vocational education'' in these proposed regulations differs
from the definition of ``vocational program'' as that term is defined in the proposed regulations for the State Postsecondary
Review Program (``an educational program below the baccalaureate degree level, that is not classified as a professional
program, that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized profession''). The Secretary requests specific
comment on whether the same definition should be used in both regulations and, if so, what that definition should be.

Section 602.3&blank;Organization and Membership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 496(a) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit
to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to be administratively and financially separate from and independent
of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization. The term ``separate and
independent'' is defined in section 496(b) of the HEA. In &sect;602.3 (a), (b), and (c) of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary reiterates the statutory requirement and definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, non-Federal negotiators expressed concern that the ``separate and
independent'' requirement would prevent any joint use of personnel, services, equipment, or facilities by an accrediting
agency and a related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization, a practice that is
fairly common among accrediting agencies and helps reduce the cost of accreditation. To address this concern, in
&sect;602.3(d) the Secretary proposes conditions that accrediting agencies must meet regarding the joint use of
personnel, services, equipment, or facilities if that use is not to be considered a violation of the ``separate and
independent'' requirement. The Secretary believes this approach respects the intent of Congress yet eases the financial
burden on agencies to implement the new requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 496(a) of the HEA permits the Secretary to waive the ``separate and independent'' requirement if the agency
is one that, for purposes of determining eligibility for SFA programs, either conducts accreditation through a voluntary
membership organization of individuals participating in a profession or has as its principal purpose the accreditation
of programs within institutions that are accredited by another agency recognized by the Secretary. In &sect;602.3(e)
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary proposes conditions under which the Secretary may waive the ``separate
and independent'' requirement. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to grant an agency's request for a waiver if
the agency demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the existing relationship between the agency and the
trade association or membership organization has not compromised the independence of its accreditation process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In providing comments with regard to this section, the Secretary advises commenters that only the type of accrediting
agency described in &sect;602.3(b)(4) may seek a waiver of the separate and independent requirement under the law.
Thus, the Secretary is precluded by statute from waiving this requirement for any other type of accrediting agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary wishes to note that the language in &sect;602.3(c)(2) specifying that no less than one-seventh
of an agency's decision-making body must consist of representatives of the public is derived from language in the
Conference Report stating that the House agrees to the requirement in the Senate bill that ``at least one out of every
seven members of an accreditation association's board be members of the general public.''

Section 602.4&blank;Submission of Information to the Secretary by Recognized Accrediting Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 496 does not specifically address the type of information that a recognized accrediting agency must submit
to the Secretary to enable the Secretary to evaluate whether the agency continues to comply with the requirements
for recognition throughout its recognition period. In &sect;602.4 (a),(b), (c), (d), and (f) of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary proposes various types of information that recognized agencies must routinely submit to the Secretary
during their recognition period. All of the items on the list were agreed to by the negotiators, who did not perceive
them to be particularly burdensome to agencies to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of particular note is the requirement in &sect;602.4(e) that accrediting agencies must submit to the Secretary,
upon request, information to assist the Secretary in resolving problems with any institution or program accredited
by the agency, provided the Secretary's request does not conflict with the agency's policies on confidentiality
with respect to its records on its institutions or programs. This provision reflects the agreement of negotiators.
However, the Secretary has reconsidered the ``confidentiality'' aspect of this provision because of a concern that
certain information that the Secretary may need to resolve a problem with a particular institution or program may
not be obtainable from an agency because of its confidentiality policies. The Secretary believes this situation
is untenable because it allows agencies to withhold information that the Secretary may need to carry out the Secretary's
responsibilities under the Act, such as determining whether an institution or program accredited by the agency should
remain eligible to participate in SFA programs. The Secretary seeks suggestions for resolving this dilemma in a manner
that respects both the agency's need for confidentiality and the Secretary's need for information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must refer to the
Department's Office of Inspector General any fraudulent activities it discovers on the part of an institution or
program that it accredits, if the institution or program participates in Department programs. The Secretary invites
comments on this possible additional requirement and alternative approaches to sharing information among members
of the triad concerning suspected fraudulent activity by an institution or program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide, by regulation, the procedures the Secretary uses for
recognizing accrediting agencies. In the proposed regulations, the Secretary proposes to specify procedures for
recognizing accrediting agencies in far greater detail than in current or previous regulations. The Secretary believes
this greater detail is necessary to ensure that all agencies applying for recognition, as well as other interested
parties, have a clear understanding of the entire process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the application for recognition constitutes a significant burden on agencies seeking
recognition by the Secretary. For this reason, the Secretary is considering ways to minimize the burden. One approach
under consideration is to allow an agency to provide a simple statement of assurance, along with supporting documentation,
that it meets certain requirements for recognition. The Secretary estimates that at least two-thirds of the requirements
in the proposed regulations are amenable to this type of approach, and the resultant savings in time, effort, and cost
to prepare an application for recognition would be significant. The Secretary invites comments on this approach
and alternative methods for minimizing the burden on agencies of the application process without adversely affecting
the Secretary's ability to conduct a thorough evaluation of the agency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The recognition process, as described in subpart B of the proposed regulations, consists of an application to the
Secretary by the agency, an analysis of the application by a designated Department official, an opportunity for a
written response to that analysis by the applicant agency, a review of the agency's application by the National Advisory
Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (Advisory Committee), a recommendation to the Secretary by the
Advisory Committee with regard to that application, an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation
by either the agency or the designated Department official, and, finally, a decision on that application by the Secretary.
The analysis of an agency's application by the designated Department official includes publication of a notice of
the agency's application in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting comment on the agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and a review by the designated
Department official of any public comment received. The Secretary believes the new procedures for recognition allow
an agency a full and fair review of its application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional appeal procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations add two key new steps to the recognition process. First, in &sect;602.11(b) the Secretary
gives an accrediting agency seeking recognition by the Secretary an opportunity to respond in writing to the designated
Department official's analysis of its application for recognition before the application is reviewed by the Advisory
Committee. Second, in &sect;602.13(b), after the Advisory Committee completes its review of the agency's application
and makes a recommendation to the Secretary on the agency's application, the Secretary gives both the agency and the
designated Department official an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation. The contesting
party, however, may not submit any evidence to the Secretary that it did not submit to the Advisory Committee. This
restriction is to ensure that the Advisory Committee's authority is not circumvented. The Secretary believes that
in general the only reasonable grounds for contesting an Advisory Committee recommendation would be if the contesting
party could demonstrate that the Advisory Committee either misunderstood or did not take into proper account certain
information presented by the contesting party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The negotiators reached consensus during the negotiated rulemaking sessions on the first step. The Secretary added
the second step after the negotiated rulemaking sessions ended to address the non-Federal negotiators' concerns
about the lack of sufficient appeal mechanisms for agencies prior to the Secretary's final decision. The Secretary
believes that these two new steps in the proposed recognition process provide agencies with sufficient opportunity
to present any concerns they might have regarding the recommendation of either the designated Department official
or the Advisory Committee before the Secretary reaches a decision on the agency's application.

 Section 496(n) of the HEA requires the Secretary to conduct an independent analysis of an agency's application for
recognition, which must include a site visit to the accrediting agency and may, at the Secretary's discretion, include
site visits to representative institutions or programs accredited by the agency. Section 496(n) of the HEA also provides
that the site visits may be unannounced, as appropriate. Accordingly, both &sect;602.10(b) and &sect;602.11(b)
of the proposed regulations provide for unannounced site visits. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to conduct
unannounced site visits only, where necessary in the judgment of the Secretary, to obtain information to verify the
agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and the information would not be forthcoming in an announced
site visit. The Secretary wishes to make it clear that this Secretarial judgment is not subject to challenge by an accrediting
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.11(b), the Secretary also proposes that the Secretary's evaluation of an agency may include a review
of information directly related to the institutions or programs accredited by the agency, as this information relates
to the institution's or program's compliance with the agency's standards, the effectiveness of those standards,
or the agency's application of those standards. The Secretary believes that the inclusion of this language in the
proposed regulations, which was agreed to by negotiators, provides the agency, the institutions and programs it
accredits, and the general public with a clear understanding of the scope of the Secretary's evaluation of an agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, to implement section 496(n) of the HEA, the proposed regulations make it clear that in evaluating an agency's
application for recognition, the Secretary may not and does not depend solely on written submissions from the accrediting
agency or on announced visits to the agency or its member institutions or programs. The Secretary makes a more thorough
and independent evaluation of an agency's application for recognition, including, where appropriate, unannounced
visits to ensure that information available to the designated Department official is comprehensive, accurate,
and unbiased, and to ensure that the agency is actually carrying out its stated policies and procedures.

Scope of recognition requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under &sect;602.10(b) of the current regulations, in order for an accrediting agency to be recognized by the Secretary,
the agency has to meet each recognition criterion taken as a whole unless it can demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction
that one or more criteria should not be applied. In &sect;602.13(c) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires
an agency to meet each of the requirements contained in this part. However, in &sect;602.13(e) the Secretary proposes
that the Secretary may exercise discretion and grant recognition to an agency that does not comply with each requirement
if the Secretary determines that the agency's effectiveness is not impaired by its noncompliance. Such discretion
might, for example, be exercised if an accrediting agency is unable to conduct an unannounced site visit, as required
by &sect;602.24, because the program being evaluated is offered on a military installation that requires prior approval
before any visitors are permitted on the installation. The Secretary believes that Secretarial discretion provides
the desired flexibility that non-Federal negotiators sought during the negotiated rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consensus was reached by negotiators regarding the elements to be included in the scope of recognition the Secretary
grants to an agency, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., geographic area, the degrees or certificates awarded, the types of courses or programs offered, and the length
of the recognition period. In the proposed regulations, the Secretary has clarified that an agency's scope of recognition
does not automatically extend to any preaccreditation status it offers. Rather, when an agency formally applies
for recognition, it must include the types of preaccreditation status for which it seeks recognition, and the Secretary
grants recognition to an agency for each preaccreditation status if the agency complies with all the requirements
for recognition with regard to that preaccreditation status.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(l) of the HEA permits the Secretary to limit, suspend, or terminate the Secretary's recognition of an
accrediting agency before the completion of the agency's recognition period if the Secretary determines that the
agency has failed to meet any of the requirements of part 602. In &sect;602.14 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary
establishes the procedures to be followed before the Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition.
The proposed procedures allow the agency to request a hearing to contest that action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that, if an agency requests a hearing, the hearing will be conducted by the Advisory Committee.
However, the Secretary further proposes that the hearing may be conducted by a subcommittee of the Advisory Committee,
consisting of three members of the Advisory Committee, if the schedule of the full Advisory Committee would not permit
a hearing to be held in a timely manner. After evaluating the evidence presented before it, the Advisory Committee
or subcommittee makes a recommendation to the Secretary as to whether the sanction proposed by the designated Department
official, no sanction, or another sanction is warranted. Any hearing held under this section is open to the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the negotiated rulemaking sessions, in response to non-Federal negotiators' concerns about the lack of sufficient
appeal mechanisms, the Secretary added to this section a provision that either party in a hearing may appeal the Advisory
Committee's or subcommittee's recommendation to the Secretary.

Section602.15&blank;Requests for Reconsideration of the Secretary's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide in regulation the procedures to be followed by an accrediting
agency for the appeal of the Secretary's decision regarding its application for recognition. Accordingly, in &sect;602.15
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary permits an agency to request reconsideration of a final decision of the
Secretary regarding either the agency's application for recognition or the limitation, suspension, or termination
of the agency's recognition. However, &sect;602.15(a)(2) proposes that a request for reconsideration may be made
only under limited conditions. Under these limited conditions, the agency may request reconsideration only if it
demonstrates that it has new information that could not have been presented previously and that the information is
likely to result in reversal of the Secretary's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, as noted by the non-Federal negotiators at the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the grounds for reconsideration
are narrow, the Secretary believes the narrow grounds are appropriate. Adverse decisions regarding an agency's
application for recognition are made by the Advisory Committee and forwarded to the Secretary. Under &sect;602.13,
the agency may appeal the Advisory Committee's recommendation to the Secretary. Similarly, under &sect;602.14,
the agency may appeal an adverse Advisory Committee or subcommittee recommendation to the Secretary under a limitation,
suspension or termination proceeding. Therefore, the Secretary believes that reconsideration requests should
be narrowly circumscribed. The Secretary notes that non-Federal negotiators requested opportunities for agencies
to request reconsideration in cases where the Secretary had not established appeal procedures. Given the provisions
for appeal that are now in the proposed regulations, the Secretary requests public comment on whether reconsideration
procedures are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary wishes to make clear that any agency that fails to notify the Secretary of its intent to file a written
request for reconsideration within the 10-day time frame specified in the regulations forfeits its right to reconsideration.
Additionally, the Secretary wishes to reiterate that, in general, any failure to meet a required deadline date in
any appeal to the Secretary results in a forfeiture of that appeal right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While consensus was reached during the negotiated rulemaking sessions that an agency should have 45 days to submit
its written request for reconsideration, the Secretary questions whether a shorter period_30 days_is sufficient
for the agency to prepare an adequate request, given the fact that 30 days is the usual time frame specified by the Department
for other types of appeals to the Secretary. The Secretary requests comments on the shorter period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because requests for reconsideration are restricted to instances where the Secretary's decision involves denial,
limitation, suspension, or termination of an agency's recognition, it is anticipated that, due to the extensive
material that must be reviewed, the Secretary will require more than 30 days to reach a final decision on an agency's
request for reconsideration. Non-Federal negotiators were concerned that there be some time limit imposed to bring
the issue to closure. Accordingly, the Secretary is proposing a 60-day time frame for reaching a final decision on
an agency's request for reconsideration.

As mentioned in &sect;602.15, section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide for the appeal of the Secretary's
decision regarding an accrediting agency's application for recognition. In &sect;602.16 of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary provides for an appeal to the Federal courts of all final decisions of the Secretary regarding an agency's
application for recognition. During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, non-Federal negotiators urged an appeals
procedure other than through the courts, as, for example, through an administrative law judge. However, the Secretary
believes that there can be no administrative appeal within the Department of a Secretarial decision since the Secretary,
as head of the Department of Education, makes all final decisions on behalf of the Department. It should be noted, however,
that in response to the non-Federal negotiators' concerns, the Secretary has modified the proposed recognition
procedures to include an opportunity for an agency to appeal an Advisory Committee's recommendation to the Secretary
before the Secretary reaches a final decision on the agency's application. The proposed limitation, suspension,
and termination procedures also have been modified to provide for an appeal to the Secretary of an Advisory Committee
or subcommittee recommendation.

Section 602.22&blank;Demonstration of Accreditation Experience

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a)(1) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to demonstrate experience in operating as an accrediting
agency as a condition for recognition. In &sect;602.22 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary defines what a
demonstration of accrediting experience must include, basically reiterating the requirements for experience
set forth in &sect;602.14 of the current regulations. However, &sect;602.22 does not contain the requirement set
forth in &sect;602.14(c) of the current regulations that agencies must demonstrate that their policies, evaluation
methods, and decisions are accepted throughout the United States by recognized accrediting agencies. The Secretary
is aware, as argued by the non-Federal negotiators, that this requirement is an important indicator of an agency's
acceptance. On the other hand, this requirement has been subject to criticism by persons and institutions interested
in forming new accrediting agencies. These individuals and agencies have often expressed concern to the Secretary
that this requirement imposes unfair hurdles for them and unduly stifles competition among accrediting agencies.
The Secretary proposes to eliminate this requirement because the Secretary believes that it is inappropriate to
require acceptance by recognized agencies as a condition for recognition even though evidence of acceptance by recognized
accrediting agencies provides some measure of an agency's reliability.

Section 602.23&blank;Application of Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations require accrediting agencies to maintain a systematic program of review designed to assess
the validity and reliability of their criteria, procedures, and standards and their relevance to the educational
and training needs of affected students. As this requirement is fundamental to sound accrediting practice, there
was consensus among negotiators that it should continue to be part of any regulations governing the accrediting agency
recognition process. However, the language of the requirement has been changed in the proposed regulations from
the language of the current regulations in response to the non-Federal negotiators' concerns about various technical
interpretations of the words ``validity and reliability.'' The substance of the requirement, as expressed in &sect;602.23(b)(5),
is unchanged. The Secretary wishes to emphasize the importance of this requirement, which is fundamental to the establishment
of sound standards for the accreditation process and the determination of educational quality.

Section 602.24&blank;Accreditation Processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(c)(1) of the HEA requires that, in addition to the announced on-site review that is part of the regular
accreditation process, an accrediting agency whose accreditation enables the institutions it accredits to participate
in programs authorized under the HEA must conduct, some time during any accreditation or preaccreditation period,
at least one unannounced on-site review at each institution that provides vocational education or training. Accordingly,
in &sect;602.24(c) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires unannounced site visits by these accrediting
agencies. However, as noted in the discussion of &sect;602.2, if the term ``vocational education'' is interpreted
literally, it could be viewed as including all postsecondary education, and, under this interpretation, accrediting
agencies would have to conduct unannounced site visits to all institutions. To avoid this outcome, in &sect;602.24(c)
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary limits the type of vocational education programs that trigger unannounced
visits to the prebaccalaureate level. As non-Federal negotiators were divided among themselves as to the definition
of vocational education, they did not reach consensus on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned in the discussion under &sect;602.2, the Secretary is considering an alternative definition of prebaccalaureate
vocational education that would not require unannounced site visits to degree-granting institutions whose prebaccalaureate
vocational programs lead to the associate degree. This would minimize the burden of the new requirement for unannounced
visits, hopefully without any adverse consequences. The Secretary invites comments on this approach and suggestions
for alternative ways of reducing the burden without eliminating from review those institutions offering vocational
education that have abused the Title IV program.

Section 602.25&blank;Additions to or Substantive Changes in Educational Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a) of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable authorities
as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. Section 496
does not specifically address the manner in which accrediting agencies evaluate either new programs begun by institutions
after their last grant of accreditation or preaccreditation or programs that are substantially changed after the
institution is accredited or preaccredited. However, the Secretary believes that an agency cannot be a reliable
authority as to the quality of education or training offered by an institution if the agency does not assess those new
or substantively changed programs. Accordingly, in &sect;602.25 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes
the framework for a policy that accrediting agencies must have to address additions to and substantive changes in
educational programs. Specifically, in &sect;602.25(a) the Secretary proposes that an accrediting agency may
include within its previous grant of accreditation or preaccreditation an educational program that an institution
initially offers or substantively changes after that grant of accreditation or preaccreditation only if the agency
specifically evaluates and approves the program. The Secretary proposes this requirement based upon the past actions
of some accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain accrediting agencies that accredit institutions offering specific prebaccalaureate vocational education
programs have, on occasion, extended their accreditation to additional programs that these institutions offered
after being accredited, without evaluating the quality of those additional programs, even though the additional
programs were totally unrelated to the programs initially accredited. For example, an accrediting agency that accredited
an institution that offered cosmetology courses extended its accreditation to additional programs that the institution
subsequently offered in jet airplane mechanics and air conditioning and refrigeration without ever evaluating
the quality of those additional programs. The Secretary believes that this practice violates the purpose of accreditation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the Secretary believes that prior approval of programs is not necessary in all circumstances, a
belief shared by negotiators, although no consensus was reached as to the circumstances. In &sect;602.25(b) the
Secretary proposes an exception to this requirement if the institution notifies the accrediting agency of the new
or substantially changed program before it is offered, and the new or substantially changed program does not provide
prebaccalaureate vocational education. The Secretary proposes this exception because the Secretary believes
that new bachelor and higher degree programs are thoroughly reviewed by a variety of entities before they may be offered.
Most institutional accrediting agencies, for example, require institutions to have thorough internal reviews
of all new degree programs by curriculum committees, governing boards, and other appropriate units within the institution
and to obtain appropriate state authorization for those new degree programs before they are offered. However, even
though an accrediting agency may not be required by these proposed regulations to evaluate a new or substantially
changed program before it is offered under &sect;602.25(b), accrediting agencies are certainly free, and encouraged,
to do so under their own policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the task of deciding which programs should require preapproval by accrediting agencies
is a difficult one and seeks suggestions from commenters. For commenters who suggest that preapproval be allowed
for prebaccalaureate vocational education programs that are ``related'' to a previously accredited program, the
Secretary requests specific suggestions on how to determine whether the new or substantially changed program is
``related'' to the other program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that most accrediting agencies already have a definition of ``substantive change'' but observes
that there is considerable variation among agencies as to what this term means. Most agencies' definitions generally
include the following kinds of changes: a substantial change in the length of a program, its content, or both, as, for
example, when a secretarial program increases from 1200 clock hours to 1600 clock hours to provide a 400-hour component
in office automation; a change from a traditional 15-week semester format to an alternate weekend format; and a change
from a certificate program to an associate degree program. The Secretary seeks to require preapproval for these and
similar types of changes and proposes that an agency's definition of a substantive change in an educational program
include, at a minimum, a substantial change in the number of clock or credit hours, the number of weeks, or the content
of a program, a change in the type of program offered, a change in the credential awarded for completion of the program,
and a change in the manner in which the institution measures the educational quantity of the program from clock hours
to credit hours. The Secretary invites comments on this approach as well as suggestions for alternative approaches
to defining which types of programs require preapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary acknowledges that the proposed requirement for a substantive change policy may result in
increased costs to agencies and, in turn, institutions. However, for the reasons noted above, the Secretary believes
the benefits far outweigh the costs. The Secretary also wishes to note that there was general consensus among non-Federal
negotiators about the appropriateness of including a substantive change requirement in the proposed regulations.
However, not all of the negotiators agreed that the approach proposed by the Secretary was appropriate.

Section 496 of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable authorities
as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs only if the agencies satisfy
standards established by the Secretary. Section 496(a) specifically requires the Secretary to establish standards
and requires the standards to include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 496(a)(5) of the HEA provides that the Secretary's standards for recognition of accrediting agencies must
require that an accrediting agency establish accreditation standards that assess 12 areas pertaining to the institutions
or programs it accredits. These areas are: (1) Curricula; (2) faculty; (3) facilities, equipment and supplies; (4)
fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operation; (5) student support services;
(6) recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading and advertising;
(7) program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees
or credentials offered; (8) measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours; (9) success with respect to
student achievement in relation to the institution's mission; (10) default rates in student loan programs under
Title IV of the HEA; (11) record of student complaints received by, or available to, the accrediting agency; and (12)
the institution's compliance with its program responsibilities under title IV of the HEA. However, under section
496(a)(5), accrediting agencies that have as their principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher
education or higher education programs to enable them to participate in Federal programs not authorized under the
HEA are exempt from the requirement to have standards for the areas listed in (7), (8), (9), (10), and (12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that most accrediting agencies already have standards addressing many of these areas. However,
to the extent that an agency does not have standards for all of them, there is an increased cost to that agency to develop
and implement the new standards. The Secretary believes that the proposed regulations minimize the increased cost
by allowing agencies maximum flexibility to set their standards to best suit their needs and the needs of the institutions
or programs they accredit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the ultimate purpose of section 496 is to authorize the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable
authorities as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit,
so that recognized agencies only accredit institutions or programs of demonstrated quality, then the Secretary
believes that each agency's standard for a particular area listed in section 496(a)(5) must evaluate the quality
of the effort the institution or program is making in that area.

Accordingly, in &sect;602.26 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires accrediting agencies to have
standards assessing the 12 areas cited in section 496(a)(5) of the HEA. In &sect;602.26(a)(3), the Secretary exempts
accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables their institutions or programs to participate only in Federal
programs not authorized under the HEA from having to establish standards for the areas listed under (7), (8), (10),
and (12). However, the Secretary does not exempt these agencies from the requirement to establish standards that
assess success with respect to student achievement. The Secretary believes that the standards specified in &sect;602.26(b)(9)
fulfill the requirement in section 496(a) of the HEA that the Secretary recognize accrediting agencies that meet
the Secretary's standards, which must include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' Furthermore,
the Secretary believes that any determination by an accrediting agency that the program or institution it accredits
provides quality education or training must be based, in part, on an assessment of the achievement of students enrolled
in the institution or program. The Secretary notes that the exemption provided in section 496(a)(5) of the HEA for
certain standards was not discussed during negotiated rulemaking because it was added as a technical legislative
amendment after the negotiations took place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the 12 required standards is discussed below. The title for each standard is based on the statutory language
used in section 496(a)(5) for that standard. Unless otherwise noted, consensus was reached among negotiators as
to language for each of the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulatory language in &sect;602.26(b) for standards addressing areas (1), (2), (3), and (5) follows
the recommendations of negotiators and simply restates the law. These four provisions require that, to be recognized
by the Secretary, an accrediting agency must adopt standards under which it evaluates the quality of an institution's
or program's curricula; faculty; facilities, equipment, and supplies; and student support services. The Secretary
has reexamined the manner in which these four standards are described in the proposed regulations and believes that
it may be more useful to provide guidance as to the manner in which quality may or should be discussed under these standards
than to simply restate the law. The Secretary requests comment on this matter. To assist commenters in this regard,
for each of the four areas, the Secretary examined the standards of several accrediting agencies to determine how
these agencies addressed quality standards for those areas and presents the results of that examination under the
appropriate topic. The Secretary invites comments on those approaches and additional suggestions for focusing
on quality assessment.

. The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's
curricula relate to the overall quality of the curricula, its appropriateness in light of an institution's or program's
educational objectives and the specific degrees or certificates awarded, and the mechanisms the institution or
program uses to evaluate the curricula and make modifications. The Secretary considers all of these to be elements
of good practice in the assessment of an institution's or program's curricula. Accordingly, the Secretary requests
specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for curricula would be a useful
addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements that the
Secretary should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement.

. The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's
faculty relate to the overall quality of the faculty, the extent to which the institution or program relies on part-time
faculty to teach students, and the effectiveness of the teaching provided by all faculty. Some agencies also include
in their standards an assessment of the procedures an institution or program uses for the hiring, promotion, evaluation,
and professional development of faculty, while other agencies merely examine these issues in light of whether the
institution's or program's policies provide for the fair and equitable treatment of faculty. The Secretary considers
all of these to be elements of good practice in the assessment of an institution's or program's faculty. Accordingly,
the Secretary requests specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for faculty
would be a useful addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other
elements that the Secretary should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement.

. The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's
facilities, equipment, and supplies relate to the overall quality of these support areas. Specifically, the Secretary
found that most accrediting agencies assess, in light of an institution's or program's educational objectives,
the adequacy and appropriateness of: libraries, learning resource centers, and other academic and instructional
support facilities; the equipment and supplies that support the instructional program; and any other physical resources
the institution or program uses to achieve its educational objectives. The Secretary considers all of these elements
to be good practices for the assessment of facilities, equipment, and supplies. Accordingly, the Secretary requests
specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for this area would be a useful addition
to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements that the Secretary
should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement.

Fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 496(a)(5)(D) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address the fiscal and administrative
capacity of an institution or program in relation to its scale of operation. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose
of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine whether the institution or program is fiscally and administratively
sound and will likely remain so for a future period. Because the financial condition of an institution is subject to
change, the Secretary proposes that an agency must make this determination each time it grants accreditation, preaccreditation,
or reaccreditation. The Secretary also proposes that an agency must examine each institution's financial capacity
in sufficient depth on an annual basis to determine if the financial capacity of the institution threatens the ability
of the institution or program to continue to meet the agency's standards and, if so, to take appropriate follow-up
action. The Secretary invites comments as to whether this follow-up action should include notifying the Secretary
of the institution's financial condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the enhanced financial monitoring by accrediting agencies that is required by these
proposed regulations will provide increased protection to students with regard to problems arising from an institution's
financial instability.

The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's

in light of the institution's or program's mission and the types of students it admits. The Secretary considers all
of these elements to be good practices for the assessment of student support services. Accordingly, the Secretary
requests specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for this area would be
a useful addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements

. Section 496(a)(5)(F) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's or program's
recruiting and admissions practices, as well as its academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising.
The Secretary believes this statutory provision contains two different standards. One standard relates to the appropriateness
of the institution's or program's recruiting and admission practices. Under this standard, the agency must determine
whether an institution's practices are reasonable in light of the institution's or program's educational mission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other standard relates to the institution's academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising.
Under that standard, which is in the nature of consumer protection, the agency must evaluate whether those items are
accurate, complete, and consistent with the institution's actual practice.

Program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials
offered.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 496(a)(5)(G) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address program length and tuition and
fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degree or credential offered. It is the Secretary's
view that one of the purposes of this requirement is to eliminate certain abuses that have been discovered at institutions
participating in Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These abusive practices fall into three main categories. One category involves accredited institutions that offer
prebaccalaureate vocational programs and charge an excessive amount of tuition and fees for programs that lead to
dead end or very low-paying jobs. In some cases, the tuition and fees for a short-term program to prepare students for
a particular job exceeded the annual income that a person employed in that job could expect to earn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another category involves accredited institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education programs
and inflate either the clock or credit hours for the program or the length of the program without educational justification,
simply to increase the amount of SFA funds these institutions may receive. The third category involves accredited
institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education that are simply too short to be able to provide training
that has any value in the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to address the statutory requirement for standards related to program length and tuition
and fees by requiring an accrediting agency to establish minimum and maximum program lengths for prebaccalaureate
vocational programs. In this context, program length means both the number of clock hours or credit hours in a program
and the number of weeks that a program is offered. The Secretary invites specific comments with regard to this requirement.
The topic of standards for establishing minimum and maximum program lengths was not discussed during the negotiated
rulemaking sessions, and the Secretary invites comments on this topic as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, consensus was reached on various factors that should be considered when
an agency establishes its standard for program length in relation to tuition and fees. These factors are listed under
&sect;602.26(b)(7) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). The Secretary has reconsidered this matter and now proposes two additional
factors. The first concerns any applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Secretary does not believe the
addition of a requirement for agencies to take into account applicable statutes and regulations when developing
their standards goes beyond the intent of the HEA because it does not require agencies to adopt the Federal policies
but simply to take them into account. The second factor concerns the relationship between tuition and fees for a prebaccalaureate
vocational program and the remuneration that a graduate of that program can reasonably be expected to receive. The
Secretary is concerned about this issue for this type of program because the very purpose of a prebaccalaureate vocational
program is to prepare a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Moreover, the Secretary is concerned
that tuition and fees being charged for prebaccalaureate vocational programs may be excessive given the type of job
for which a graduate of the program qualifies. Accordingly, the Secretary requests specific comment regarding standards
that address tuition and fee charges for a prebaccalaureate vocational program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vis-a-vis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the remuneration that graduates of a program may receive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests comments on the various factors proposed for standards that assess program length and tuition
and fees. In calling for comments with regard to this standard, the Secretary wishes to remind commenters that a violation
of a standard does not necessarily preclude an agency from accrediting an institution or program. The violation would,
however, at least require the institution to justify its tuition and fee charges to the agency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the development of standards for this area involves very complex issues. For the
purpose of stimulating discussion in this area, the Secretary offers the following possible approaches to the development
of standards. Under one approach, the standard might require that annualized tuition and fees for a program not exceed
a percentage of the annualized minimum wage. Under another approach, the standard might require that annualized
tuition and fees for a program not exceed a percentage of the program's graduates' average earnings for their first
year of employment. Under still another approach, annualized tuition and fees for a program could not exceed a percentage
of the average annualized wages, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in occupations for which the program
prepares students. In suggesting possible approaches to the establishment of standards for this area, the Secretary
reminds commenters of the difficulty in obtaining employment information, including salaries and wages, from graduates
of an institution for periods beyond the first year after graduation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is considering establishing in other regulations requirements governing program length and tuition
and fees for programs that are eligible to participate in the SFA programs. Accordingly, if those regulatory requirements
are established, the Secretary would consider requiring an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary if it knows
that an institution's program is too long or too short under that requirement, or if it knows that an institution's
tuition and fee charges violate that other requirement. The Secretary invites comments about the feasibility of
adding this notification requirement or any alternative method of obtaining this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary notes that the requirement to establish a standard for program length and tuition and fees
applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate
in programs authorized under the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 602.26(b)(8) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 496(a)(5)(H) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address measures of program length in
clock or credit hours. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine
if an institution take into proper account, as appropriate, factors such as program objectives and content, the types
and locations of instructional delivery, and the knowledge and skills necessary for students to reach competence
in the field being taught when determining the length of its programs in clock or credit hours. General agreement was
reached by negotiators with regard to the substance of this standard. However, the Secretary has reconsidered this
matter and now proposes an additional factor: any applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Secretary does
not believe the addition of a requirement for agencies to take into account applicable statutes and regulations when
developing their standards goes beyond the HEA because it does not require agencies to adopt the Federal policies
but simply to take them into account. The Secretary invites comments on this proposed addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the Secretary regulates this area in other regulations governing the SFA programs, these regulations
may need to be modified. Moreover, as indicated with regard to &sect;602.26(b)(7), if those other regulations are
established, the Secretary may consider requiring an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary if it knows that
an institution's measure of the number of credits hours in its programs does not satisfy that other regulatory requirement.
The Secretary invites comments about the feasibility of adding this notification requirement or on alternative
methods of obtaining this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that the requirement to establish a standard for measures of program length in clock or credit
hours applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to
participate in programs authorized under the HEA.

Success with respect to student achievement in relation to mission.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 496(a)(5)(I) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address success with respect
to student achievement in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of course completion rates,
pass rates on State licensing examinations, and job placement rates. It is the Secretary's view that standards for
student achievement are the most important of all accreditation standards because the true success of an institution
or program is measured by the success of its students. For institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational programs,
the Secretary proposes to require agencies to establish minimum quantitative standards for completion rates, job
placement rates, and pass rates on State licensing examinations for those programs, since gainful employment is
the purpose of those programs. The Secretary proposes this additional requirement for institutions offering prebaccalaureate
vocational education programs because, as noted in the discussion under &sect;602.26(b)(7), these institutions
have often engaged in abusive practices. The Secretary notes that the concept of minimum quantitative standards,
even when restricted to prebaccalaureate vocational education, was not supported by non-Federal negotiators.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary acknowledges that there are many possible approaches to the establishment of the standards for measuring
success in prebaccalaureate vocational programs, both in terms of the information collected and the minimum standard
selected. For example, if an institution's students are mainly first-time, full-time students in short-term programs,
agencies could use data collected by institutions under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act of 1990
for calculating completion rates. Minimum job placement rate standards might be developed using three-year moving
averages, adjusted for regional unemployment rates as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department
of Labor. Further, a job placement rate could be calculated only for those jobs in the areas for which training was offered,
all jobs obtained by graduates, or a combination of the two. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary specifically invites suggestions for standards in this area. Further, the Secretary understands
that developing appropriate standards in these areas is not easy and requests suggestions with regard to specific
rates for the standards in these areas. The Secretary suggests as a reference point for completion and placement rates
the statutory requirement, contained in section 481(e)(2) of the HEA, that, to be an eligible short-term vocational
program under the SFA programs, a program must have a 70 percent completion and a 70 percent placement rate.

Default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the HEA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 496(a)(5)(J) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's
default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the HEA. It is the Secretary's view that the
purpose of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine if an institution is out of compliance with its accrediting
standards when the institution's latest cohort default rate under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs
exceeds a certain threshold or has increased significantly over its previous rate. The Secretary proposes to require
an agency to conduct a review if an institution's latest cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent. The Secretary
establishes this rate as the trigger for review because that is the rate, beginning in fiscal year 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 October 1, 1993, at which an institution will be disqualified from participating in the FFEL programs. An accrediting
agency is free, of course, to set its trigger for review at a default rate below 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also is concerned that a significant change in an institution's default rate could be an indication
of other serious problems that may affect the institution's compliance with an agency's standards. For this reason,
the Secretary proposes to require an agency to conduct a review when the institution's latest cohort default rate
increases significantly over its rate the previous year. The Secretary does not propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to define the term ``significant increase'' in the proposed regulations but invites comments on an appropriate definition.
One possibility that the Secretary is considering is to require an agency to conduct a review when the institution's
default rate increases by more than 50 percent from its previous rate, provided that previous rate exceeds 10 percent.
The Secretary believes that a cohort default rate below 10 percent is not necessarily an indication that the institution
may be in violation of its accrediting agency's standards. Therefore, this provision would apply only if the institution's
latest cohort default rate exceeds 15 percent and has increased by more than 50 percent from its previous rate. The
Secretary invites comments on this approach and other approaches that will provide guidance to agencies on what constitutes
a significant increase in default rate.

. Section 496(a)(5)(K) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address the record of student
complaints received by, or available to, an agency concerning an institution or program it accredits. It is the Secretary's
view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable an agency to focus its evaluation of the institution or program
on the matters that gave rise to the student complaints when the agency undertakes its next evaluation of the institution
or program.

Compliance with an institution's program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 496(a)(5)(L) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's
compliance with its program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act. It is the Secretary's view that an institution's
failure to comply with its Title IV responsibilities should be a factor in an accrediting agency's determination
as to whether that institution should continue to be accredited by the agency. The Secretary recognizes that accrediting
agencies do not have the responsibility, expertise, personnel, or time to evaluate, on a routine basis, whether the
institutions they accredit are in compliance with their Title IV responsibilities. On the other hand, agencies may
not ignore information provided to them regarding the lack of compliance of those institutions. Accordingly, the
Secretary proposes that, in assessing an institution's compliance under this standard, the agency relies on documentation
forwarded to it by the Secretary. The Secretary wishes to make it clear that this section of the proposed regulations
does not require accrediting agencies to review an institution to determine whether the institution is fulfilling
its responsibilities under the SFA programs, as, for example, by verifying that an institution is calculating Pell
distributions properly. Rather, the Secretary expects agencies to use the information provided by the Secretary
on the institution to trigger a review of the institution for compliance with agency standards if the documentation
provided by the Secretary indicates a problem that is related to one or more of the agency's standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that the requirement to establish standards for this area applies only to those accrediting agencies
whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution's practice of making refunds to students
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under section 484B of the HEA, an institution participating in the SFA programs must have a fair and equitable refund
policy. An institution's refund policy is judged to be fair and equitable if it provides a refund in an amount of at least
the largest of the amounts provided under ``(1) the requirements of applicable State law; (2) the specific refund
requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency and approved by the Secretary;
or (3) the pro rata refund calculation'' described elsewhere in section 484B. To permit an institution to satisfy
the fair and equitable refund requirement using this criterion, the Secretary proposes not to recognize an accrediting
agency unless the agency has a refund policy that provides for a fair and equitable refund to a student of tuition, fees,
and other institutional charges. Thus, the Secretary's recognition of an agency means that the Secretary has approved
that agency's refund policy. Non-Federal negotiators objected to the inclusion of this requirement in the proposed
regulations on the grounds that section 496(g) of the HEA explicitly states that the Secretary may not establish standards
for accrediting agencies that are not required by section 496. The Secretary believes, however, that the inclusion
of a requirement for a standard addressing an institution's refund policy in the proposed regulations is necessary
to comply with section 484B of the HEA.

Time limit on correcting deficiencies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.26(c), the Secretary proposes that, when an institution or program fails to meet an agency standard,
the agency may permit the institution or program a period, which may not exceed 18 months, during which time it must
take corrective action to bring itself back into compliance with the standard. The agency is free to set the time frame
for coming into compliance at less than 18 months. If the institution or program fails to bring itself into compliance
during the specified period, the agency must take adverse action, unless it finds that the time frame for achieving
compliance should be extended for cause. Of course, the agency may take adverse action against an institution or program,
either immediately or in less than 18 months, without offering the institution or program the opportunity to take
corrective action if the agency believes that the adverse action is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the 18-month time frame is necessary to ensure that institutions and programs make serious
efforts to improve the quality of their offerings and to ensure that accrediting agencies take adverse actions when
institutions fail to make those efforts. Accordingly, the Secretary anticipates that extensions beyond 18 months
for cause will not be routinely granted. Additionally, the Secretary anticipates that for violations that are easily
correctable, the appropriate period will be significantly less than 18 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must take action not
only if it determines that an institution or program is not in compliance with a standard but also if it determines that
an institution or program may currently meet the standard but is unlikely to be able to continue to meet the standard.
The Secretary invites comments on this possible addition to the section.

Section 602.27&blank;Required Operating Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(c) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables institutions to participate
in Title IV, HEA programs to take special action whenever institutions establish new branch campuses or undergo changes
in ownership that result in changes in control. Accordingly, in &sect;602.27 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary
reiterates the requirement for special action set forth in that section. For purposes of this section, the Secretary
notes that the term ``branch campus'' includes any ``additional location,'' which the Secretary defines to be a location
that is geographically apart from the main campus, that has its own separate administrative structure, services,
and facilities, and at which the institution plans to offer a complete educational program. The Secretary believes
the inclusion of additional locations in this requirement is consistent with the intent of Congress. The close scrutiny
of branch campuses and additional locations includes the requirement contained in sections 496(c)((2) and (3) to
approve a business plan for a branch prior to its opening; to extend accreditation to the branch only after determining
that it has sufficient educational, financial, operations, management, and physical resources to provide education
or training consistent with the accreditation standards; and to conduct on-site reviews within six months for all
new branches and all institutions that change ownership that results in a change in control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another requirement of section 496(c) of the HEA is that any institution participating in Title IV, HEA programs that
enters into a teach-out agreement with another institution must agree to submit to its accrediting agency for approval
a teach-out agreement that is consistent with applicable standards and regulations. In &sect;602.27(b) of the proposed
regulations, the Secretary reiterates this requirement.

Section 602.28&blank;Due Process for Institutions and Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a)(6) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency seeking recognition by the Secretary to use procedures
throughout its accreditation process that satisfy due process requirements. Accordingly, in &sect;602.28 of the
proposed regulations, the Secretary sets out this due process requirement. Specifically, in &sect;602.28 the Secretary
requires an agency to set forth in writing all of its procedures governing its accreditation and preaccreditation
processes, including its processes for the appeal of an adverse action it takes against an institution or program,
to notify an institution or program in writing of any adverse action the agency takes against it, and to afford the institution
or program the opportunity to appeal the adverse action. In accordance with section 496(a)(6)(D) of the HEA, in &sect;602.28(b)(5)
the Secretary specifically requires that an agency permit an institution or program the right to representation
by counsel during an appeal of an adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the cost to an agency when an institution or program appeals an adverse action can
be substantial. To minimize this cost, the Secretary has included in &sect;602.28(b)(5) a provision, suggested
by non-Federal negotiators, that agencies be given the discretion to determine when an appeal may be made only in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a)(7) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to notify the Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary
review entities, and the public of any final adverse accrediting action regarding an institution or program. Accordingly,
in &sect;602.29(a) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes this notification requirement. The
Secretary proposes an additional requirement in &sect;602.29(a) that is not specified in the law: that accrediting
agencies notify other appropriate accrediting agencies of all final adverse actions. The Secretary believes this
additional notification requirement, which was suggested after the negotiated rulemaking sessions by one of the
non-Federal negotiators, is necessary because of the requirement, implied in section 496(l)(2) of the HEA, that
an accrediting agency must take into account the adverse accrediting actions of other accrediting agencies in making
its own accrediting decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 496(a)(8) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to make available to the Secretary, the appropriate State
postsecondary review entity and, upon request, the public a brief statement supporting any decision to deny, withdraw,
suspend, or terminate the accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution or program, together with the comments
of the affected institution or program concerning that decision. Accordingly, in &sect;602.29 of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary establishes this requirement. To ensure that the statement is made available in a timely fashion, the
Secretary proposes to require that the statement be made available within 60 days of an agency's final decision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that agencies notify the Secretary prior to taking
final adverse action against an institution when the information that caused the agency to take the adverse action
may relate to the institution's continued participation in Title IV, HEA programs, as, for example, in the case of
fraud or gross mismanagement of Federal funds. The Secretary is considering this additional notification requirement
because of the length of time it often takes agencies to reach a final adverse decision, due to an institution's rights
under due process, even when circumstances indicate a gross violation of agency standards. The Secretary invites
comments on this additional requirement and alternative approaches to notifying the Secretary when an agency has
such serious concerns about an institution that it initiates an adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must notify
the Secretary and the appropriate State postsecondary review entity of any final adverse accrediting action at the
same time the agency notifies the institution of this action. The Secretary believes this addition would prevent
excessive draw-down of SFA funds by an institution after it loses accreditation. The Secretary notes that, while
this topic was not discussed during negotiated rulemaking, many negotiators have told Department staff that this
additional requirement would not present an undue hardship to their agencies. The Secretary invites comments on
this proposed additional requirement and suggestions for alternative approaches to prevent unwarranted expenditure
of SFA funds by institutions that have lost accreditation.

Section 602.30&blank;Regard for Decisions of States and Other Accrediting Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(l)(2) of the HEA implies that accrediting agencies are responsible for knowing what actions other recognized
accrediting agencies have taken against an institution. The Secretary addresses this issue in &sect;602.30 by proposing
that all agencies, including those that accredit only programs, take into account the decisions of States and other
accrediting agencies when making any accreditation or preaccreditation decision involving an institution or program.
The Secretary believes the inclusion of programmatic accrediting agencies in this requirement is essential to ensure
that the problems that caused a programmatic accrediting agency to take adverse action against a program within an
institution are promptly reviewed by the institutional accrediting agency that accredits the institution to determine
if the institution is still in compliance with the latter agency's standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.30(a)(3) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires that agencies routinely share with other
appropriate recognized accrediting agencies and State agencies information about any actions they have taken regarding
an institution's or programs's accreditation or preaccreditation. The Secretary is considering adding to this
section a requirement that agencies share information about actions they are taking or are about to take regarding
an institution's or program's accreditation or preaccreditation. The Secretary invites comments on this additional
requirement and alternative approaches to sharing information with the other members of the triad regarding actions
either under way or planned by the agency with respect to an institution or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in &sect;602.30(b) the Secretary proposes that agencies are subject to the requirements in &sect;602.30(a)
if they ``knew, or should have known,'' of the actions being taken by another recognized accrediting agency or State
agency. The Secretary believes that it is reasonable to expect an agency to have known of these actions if there is evidence
that the other agencies have sent information concerning these actions to the agency.

The following discussion addresses other issues either discussed by negotiators or raised by the Secretary after

governing the accrediting agency recognition process, and thus none warrants inclusion in the previous section.

Accrediting agency. While the definition in the proposed regulations eliminates the language in the current regulations
describing the type of entity that may comprise an agency, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the legal entity
that is an accrediting agency may be an association, council, commission, or corporation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Designated Department official. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While this term is not used in the current regulations, the Secretary proposes to use it in subpart B on recognition
and termination procedures to describe much of what has, in fact, been the Department's practice with respect to the
accrediting agency recognition process. For example, the Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education has,
on occasion, presented the summary of the preliminary analysis of an accrediting agency to the Advisory Committee;
on other occasions, the Assistant Secretary has delegated that responsibility to a member of the Assistant Secretary's
staff. After the Advisory Committee meeting, the Assistant Secretary has routinely forwarded to the Secretary the
Advisory Committee's recommendation on an agency's application for recognition, along with the Assistant Secretary's
recommendation. Finally, the Assistant Secretary has routinely advised the Secretary on issues related to the recognition
of agencies. The Secretary believes that the inclusion of the term ``designated Department official'' and its use
throughout subpart B clarifies the longstanding involvement of individuals other than the Secretary in the accrediting
agency recognition process.

Consensus was reached by negotiators regarding the provisions specified in this section for demonstrating that
an accrediting agency has the necessary administrative and fiscal resources to carry out its accrediting responsibilities.
However, the Secretary is concerned that the provisions contained in this section do not adequately address whether
an agency's personnel and fiscal resources will continue to be adequate during any recognition period granted. The
Secretary invites suggestions on how to address this concern.

These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. An assessment of the potential
costs and benefits of the various requirements contained in the proposed regulations has been incorporated into
the relevant sections of this preamble. The Secretary notes that, as these proposed regulations were subject to negotiated
rulemaking, the costs and benefits of the various requirements were discussed thoroughly by negotiators. The resultant
consensus reached on a particular requirement reflected agreement on the best possible approach to that requirement
in terms of cost and benefit.

The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small number of entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are accrediting
agencies that apply for recognition by the Secretary. The regulations would not have a significant economic impact
on the institutions affected because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary
Federal supervision. The regulations would impose the minimum requirements needed to ensure the proper implementation
of the Secretary's statutory mandate to recognize accrediting agencies.

include the annual audited financial statement the institution or program submits to the Secretary under the Title
IV, HEA programs, to enable the agency to determine if the financial capacity of the institution threatens the ability
of the institution or program to continue to meet the agency's standards; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Review, as appropriate on an annual basis, the information obtained under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section
to determine if there is reason to take any follow-up action based on a reduced financial capacity.

Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325. This subpart describes the procedures and criteria to be
used for the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department invited individuals and representatives of groups involved in student financial assistance programs
to the four regional meetings. At each meeting, the Department provided for a comprehensive discussion and exchange
of information regarding the implementation of subpart 2 by providing participants with an issue paper that raised
issues and questions with regard to the statutory provisions included in subpart 2. The following is a summary of the
information provided to the Department by participants at the regional meetings. The section of the proposed regulations
that is the subject of the information is provided as a reference.

Separate and independent requirement_&sect;602.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in the regional meetings suggested that, in order for an accrediting agency to obtain a waiver of the
requirement that it be separate from and independent of, both administratively and financially, any related, associated,
affiliated, trade association or membership organization, an agency should have to demonstrate that (a) its parent
body has no role in making or ratifying its accrediting decisions, (b) it has sufficient budget and administrative
autonomy to carry out its required accrediting responsibilities, and (c) information obtained in the course of its
accrediting process is not made available to the parent body unless it is public information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unannounced visits by the Secretary_&sect;602.10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the conditions under which an unannounced visit to either an accrediting agency or an institution
or program that it accredits, as part of the Secretary's comprehensive review and evaluation of the agency, was appropriate
and suggested that such a visit would be appropriate only if (a) the Secretary had evidence of the agency's non-compliance
with the statute or Departmental regulations and (b) an unannounced site visit would assist in investigating the
non-compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity_&sect;602.12. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the role of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in reviewing
the applications of accrediting agencies seeking recognition by the Secretary and suggested that an agency should
have an opportunity to appeal the Advisory Committee's recommendation before the Secretary reaches a final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation, suspension, or termination of recognition_&sect;602.14. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the process the Secretary should use in determining whether to limit, suspend, or terminate
an accrediting agency's recognition if the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that
the agency has failed to satisfy one or more of the requirements for recognition. They suggested that the proposed
regulations should afford the agency due process by providing (a) written notice to the agency, (b) opportunity for
the agency to respond in writing, (c) public review by the Advisory Committee, (d) a written decision by the Advisory
Committee, and (e) an appeal to the Secretary.

Ability and experience_&sect;602.21&hyph;&sect;602.22. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed what standards the Secretary should use to determine whether an accrediting agency demonstrates
sufficient ability and experience in operating as an accrediting agency. Most favored retention of the language
contained in the current regulations on these issues, but a minority expressed concern that these requirements placed
undue burden on new agencies seeking initial recognition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unannounced site visits by accrediting agencies_&sect;602.24. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed whether the proposed regulations should contain specific guidance on how and when accrediting
agencies were to conduct unannounced site visits to institutions that offer vocational education and training and
also what institutions were to be visited. They were in agreement that the agency should have discretion to decide
how and when the visits took place; they were divided on the definition of institutions that offer vocational education,
so they were divided on what institutions should be visited.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Required accreditation standards_&sect;602.26. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the standards that accrediting agencies must have for 13 specific areas. They felt that programmatic
accrediting agencies and those agencies that do not accredit for purposes of Title IV should be exempt from the standards
that address default rates, institutional compliance with its program responsibilities under Title IV, and refund
policies. Their comments on specific standards were as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program length and tuition and fees_&sect;602.26(b)(7). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants felt that accrediting agencies should assess these in relation to the subject matter taught and the
objectives of the degrees or credentials offered. They also felt that the proposed regulations should protect agencies
against lawsuits alleging violation of anti-trust laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours_&sect;602.26(b)(8). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants felt that accrediting agencies should be expected to evaluate program length at non-degree granting
institutions for consistency with the time required to develop the knowledge base and skills necessary for entry
level to the vocation for which the students are being prepared. In the case of degree-granting institutions, participants
felt that agencies should evaluate program length for consistency with usual practice in higher education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Success with respect to student achievement_&sect;602.26(b)(9). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants felt that accrediting agencies should be required to consider completion rates, job placement rates,
and State licensing examination pass rates for institutions or programs that purport to train individuals for occupations,
vocations, or professions. Most participants felt that agencies should be given the flexibility to establish standards
for these areas, but a minority felt that the proposed regulations should contain specific requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Default rates_&sect;602.26(b)(10). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most participants felt that accrediting agencies should review schools for compliance with agency standards if
their default rate exceeded a certain rate, but some felt that agencies should have to remove accreditation if the
default rate exceeded a certain value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Due process for institutions and programs_&sect;602.28. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants felt that accrediting agencies should be expected to adhere to principles of fundamental procedural
fairness in dealing with institutions or programs. They also felt that any opportunity for a hearing that an agency
might provide did not necessarily imply a personal appearance by representatives of the institution or program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Implementation of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 The Secretary proposes regulations to implement the State Postsecondary Review Program (SPRP) authorized under
title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). Under the SPRP, the Secretary enters
into an agreement with a State in which the State designates a postsecondary review entity (SPRE) that is responsible
for conducting or coordinating reviews of institutions of higher education referred to the State by the Secretary
under specific statutory provisions. The purpose of the reviews is to determine whether those institutions should
continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The SPRE reviews institutions on the basis of standards developed
in consultation with institutions located in the State. The Secretary reimburses SPREs for costs they incur under
the SPRP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance programs
authorized under Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs) and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must determine,
in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under
the HEA and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education
to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as
to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution
to be legally authorized to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located.
Thus, the statutory definition of an institution of higher education provides the framework for a shared responsibility
among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to the Title IV, HEA programs
is opened to only those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy,
and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred
to as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the
triad has not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure educational quality, nor has it served as an effective
deterrent to abuse by institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. For several years, certain institutions
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs have failed to provide students with education or training of an acceptable
level of quality; they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, they have failed to meet acceptable
standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately protect Title IV, HEA program
funds entrusted to them. The institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are not restricted to a particular
sector of higher education. Rather, the abuses have been found in all types of institutions participating in the Title
IV, HEA programs, including those in the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education as well as those
in the proprietary sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies
have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs
they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit particular institutions or programs. Moreover,
some States have also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions
they authorize or license to operate in the State or to protect student interests. Finally, the Federal government's
management of its responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify institutions to participate in the Title
IV, HEA programs has not always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions that participate in those
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, Congress amended the HEA to provide
for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under that part, States and accrediting agencies
are required to assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, accrediting associations, and the Secretary
are linked to create a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate or wish to participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this coordinated evaluation
of institutions by the three components of the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its evaluation
on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education
or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility
for determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate within the State, the HEA added a new focus:
reviewing institutions that trigger certain statutory review criteria. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation
of institutions is the administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV,
HEA programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute allocates legal responsibility among the entities that compose the program integrity triad. While specific
statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together
in a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects of institutional review. Within this statutory
scheme, the Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system operates as efficiently as possible, with
maximum integration among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on postsecondary institutions.
In order to assist the Secretary in designing a final regulation that achieve these goals, the Secretary specifically
requests comment on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same
or similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency may establish different standards for evaluating
the financial responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of an institution's educational program.
Thus, a reviewed institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting agency's standards even though
those standards address the same areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce the burden on institutions
and enable the triad entities to carry out effectively their statutory functions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the final regulations be more explicit in identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any
of the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected to consider in its evaluation of an institution?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 1 of part H creates a new program, the State Postsecondary Review Program, or SPRP, under which State oversight
of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs is strengthened. Subpart 2 of part H establishes procedures
and criteria under which the Secretary recognizes an accrediting agency as a reliable authority as to the quality
of the education or training offered by institutions that the agency accredits. Lastly, Subpart 3 specifies the procedures
the Secretary uses to determine whether an institution meets the eligibility requirements and has the administrative
capacity and financial responsibility to administer the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Secretary publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the NPRM to implement the accrediting agency provisions in Subpart 2 of part H of the HEA. This provides interested
parties the opportunity to comment on the SPRP and accreditation NPRMs in a coordinated way. The Secretary also intends
to publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a NPRM implementing subpart 3 of part H of the HEA before the date the proposed regulations for Subparts 1 and 2 of part
H of the HEA become final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the SPRP, each State designates a single SPRE that reviews institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs
that are referred to the State for review by the Secretary under specific statutory provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SPRE reviews referred institutions using standards that it must develop in consultation with institutions located
in the State. Areas that those standards must cover are also set forth in specific statutory provisions. Before a SPRE
may review an institution under those standards, the standards must be evaluated by the Secretary and not disapproved
by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a SPRE finds that an institution it reviews does not satisfy the State's review standards, the SPRE may require the
institution to take prompt actions to bring itself into compliance with the State's standards, or the SPRE may determine
that the institution should no longer participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary recognizes that, in the former case, an institution may have cause for not meeting
the State's review standards. Therefore, the Secretary proposes that SPREs provide the institution the opportunity
to present compelling evidence that demonstrates that its failure to meet the State's review standards does not warrant
any further action by the SPRE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the SPRE determines that an institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the SPRE
notifies the Secretary of that determination; and, as required under section 494C(h) of the HEA, the Secretary immediately
terminates the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In implementing their role under the State Postsecondary Review Program, the Secretary expects States to develop
rigorous educational, administrative, and financial review standards and to conduct thorough, impartial reviews
of referred institutions under those standards. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates that SPRE reviews will lead
to increases in the quality of education and training provided by institutions that comply with or ascribe to the State's
review standards. The Secretary also anticipates that, through reviews of referred institutions, SPREs will help
to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs by taking actions to effect the termination of institutions
that (1) fail substantially to meet the State's review standards, and are recalcitrant in taking actions to come into
compliance with those standards, or (2) are involved in fraudulent practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations were subject to the negotiated rulemaking process in accordance with section 492 of the
HEA. Under the negotiated rulemaking process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings in September 1992 to
obtain public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. The meetings were held in San Francisco,
Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City. Before convening the meetings, the Secretary held a meeting in Washington, DC
in August 1992 to invite comments from interested parties as to the key issues that should be addressed at the regional
meetings. At the four regional meetings, the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed
in these proposed regulations. A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals and groups who attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in the negotiated
rulemaking process. The Secretary selected negotiators from the list of nominees to reflect all the groups that are
involved in the Title IV, HEA programs. With regard to these proposed regulations, the Secretary chose negotiators
who reflected the diversity of State higher education authorities, the interests of accrediting bodies, national
organizations of student financial aid administrators, institutions of higher education, and students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated provisions
of the draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in April 1993 and one in June 1993. During
the second session, the negotiators elected not to reach consensus on any of the provisions included in this notice
of proposed rulemaking until they had an opportunity to review all the proposed regulations implementing the Program
Integrity Triad. On September 20, 1993, the Secretary convened a meeting and distributed to the negotiators the proposed
regulations for each part of the Program Integrity Triad. The negotiators who attended this meeting could not reach
consensus on the provisions included in this proposed regulation. However, several negotiators submitted written
comments on the draft regulations, and many of those comments were incorporated in this notice of proposed rulemaking.

The following discussion reflects the proposed provisions governing the State Postsecondary Review Program. The
provisions are discussed in the order in which they appear in the proposed regulations. If a provision applies to more
than one section or is included in more than one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate
cross-reference to its other appearances. In addition, each section of the proposed provisions references or contains
a description of the applicable statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these provisions, the Secretary has regulated narrowly to the statute, except where the Secretary
was required by the statute to promulgate specific regulations or where the Secretary determined that regulations
were required to implement the statute. In this regard, the Secretary requests respondents to comment only on provisions
where the Secretary has made a regulatory proposal that interprets or implements the statute, rather than on provisions
that are statutorily required and cannot be changed by the Secretary.

Section 667.1&blank;Scope and Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the State Postsecondary Review Program is to strengthen State oversight of institutions participating
in the title IV, HEA programs through the development of State standards for those institutions, and State review
of referred institutions using those standards. States will be reimbursed by the Secretary for developing these
standards and conducting these reviews. However, a State will not be required to incur any cost or carry out any activity
if the State will not be reimbursed for that cost or activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators were concerned that SPREs had the authority under the SPRP to select any institution for review.
Reviews by a SPRE are limited to those institutions that currently participate in the title IV, HEA programs that the
Secretary or a State identify as meeting one or more of the review criteria in section 494C(b) of the HEA, and those institutions
a State has reason to believe are engaged in fraudulent practices. As provided in section 494C(a) of the HEA, a State
must request approval from the Secretary before it may conduct a review of an institution the State determines either
meets a statutory referral criterion or is engaged in fraudulent practices. If the Secretary approves the State's
request or does not disapprove that request within 21 days, the SPRE may conduct a review of that institution under
this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the standards that a State develops will be used for the purpose of reviewing referred institutions under
this program, nothing in this part or in the statute authorizing the SPRP, title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the HEA, precludes
a State from using these developed standards for determining whether to grant a license to or otherwise authorize
an institution to provide postsecondary education in the State. However, if a State reviews nonreferred institutions
under the standards developed for the SPRP, reviews of those institutions will not be reimbursed. Moreover, the State
may not take an action against nonreferred institutions under the SPRP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

A of title III of the HEA. Part A of title III authorizes the Strengthening Institutions Program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Professional program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The definition of a professional program applies directly to the review standards described in sections 494C(d)(8)(A)
and (14)(C) of the HEA and &sect;&sect;667.21(11)(1) and (18)(iii), respectively. The Secretary proposed to define
a ``professional program'' as an undergraduate or graduate educational program that prepares individuals for an
occupation, if that occupation_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is listed in a Federal educational program classification manual; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Requires at least an associate degree to qualify for entry; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involves the independent practice or application of a defined or organized body of competencies that is unique
to the occupation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is formally recognized and regulated under a national or State licensure, accreditation, or permit system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators argued that many educational programs that would satisfy this proposed definition of a ``professional
program'' would also satisfy the proposed definition of a ``vocational program''. Those negotiators believed that,
for purposes of developing standards under the SPRP, there should be a clear distinction between the classification
of these programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vocational program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The definition of ``vocational program'' applies directly to two review standards a State must develop under section
494C(d) of the HEA and &sect;667.21 of these regulations. Under the first standard, described in section 494C(d)(7)
of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(10), if an institution offers a program that is designed to prepare students
for gainful employment, the State must develop a standard to determine whether the tuition and fees charged for that
program by the institution are reasonable given the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that
program may reasonably be expected to earn. Under the second review standard, described in section 494C(d)(14)(C)
of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(18)(iii), if an institution offers vocational or professional programs,
the State must develop standards to determine if those programs are successful as measured, in part, by the placement
rate of the graduates of those programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During negotiated rulemaking, the Secretary proposed to define the term ``vocational program'' based on the statutory
provision included in the definition of various types of eligible institutions of higher education. Thus, the Secretary
proposed to define a vocational program as an ``undergraduate educational program that prepares students for gainful
employment in a recognized occupation.'' (See, for example, section 481(b)(1) of the HEA for a ``proprietary institution
of higher education''; section 481(c)(1) for a ``postsecondary vocational institution''; and the second sentence
of section 1201(a) of the HEA for a ``public and private nonprofit institution of higher education.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators believed this proposed definition was too vague and were concerned that it could be interpreted
to include all postsecondary undergraduate programs. Those negotiators contended that such a broad interpretation,
if applied to the review standards discussed above, would cause unnecessary burden on all institutions, and argued
for a more narrow definition of a vocational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some negotiators proposed that the term ``vocational program'' encompass only those educational programs below
the baccalaureate degree level that are not classified as ``professional programs''. Other negotiators suggested
that the term ``vocational program'' be limited further to apply only to nondegree vocational educational programs
offered by institutions whose primary purpose is to prepare students for employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that the proposed definition is too broad and thus, in &sect;667.2, proposes to define the term
``vocational program'' as ``an educational program below the baccalaureate degree level, that is not classified
as a professional program, that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the definition of ``vocational program'' in these proposed regulations differs
from the definition of ``vocational education'' as that term is defined in the proposed regulations for the Secretary's
Procedures and Criteria for the Recognition or Accrediting Agencies (``education or training that prepares students
for gainful employment in a recognized occupation''). The Secretary requests specific comment on whether the same
definition should be used in both regulations and, if so, which definition should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary particularly invites public comments on the definitions of professional and vocational programs.

Section 494 of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with each State to carry out the purposes
of this part. As provided in sections 494A(b) and 494C of the HEA, the agreement between each State and the Secretary
must contain the following elements_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A designation of a single SPRE which represents all entities in the State that are responsible for_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) granting State authorization to each institution of higher education in the State for the purposes of this title;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) ensuring that each institution of higher education in the State remains in compliance with the standards developed
pursuant to section 494C of the HEA (these provisions are discussed below in greater detail); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assurances that the SPRE has the authority under State law to make agreements between the State and the Federal
Government; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assurances that the SPRE will review institutions reported to the State by the Secretary under section 494C(a)
of the HEA (referred institutions) for the purpose of determining whether those institutions should participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs on a schedule to coincide with the dates set by the Secretary to certify or recertify those
institutions as provided in sections 481 and 498 of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assurances that the SPRE will perform the functions authorized under this part and keep such records and provide
such information as may be requested for financial and compliance audits and program evaluation, consistent with
the responsibilities of the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A description of the relationship between the SPRE and the State approving agency for Veterans Affairs, the State
guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, and the State agency responsible for administering the SSIG program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Provisions for SPRE contracts. The agreement must provide for the contracts the SPRE enters into with nationally
recognized accrediting agencies or peer review systems as required under section 494C(d)(15) of the HEA, and the
contracts the SPRE enters into with private agencies, accrediting agencies, or peer review systems for assistance
in performing SPRE review activities as provided in section 494C(f) of the HEA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) A plan for performing the functions described in section 494C of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to element (1) paragraph (A), the SPRE must represent any State entity that provides a license to postsecondary
institutions to operate in the State or otherwise legally authorizes institutions to provide postsecondary education
in the State. The Secretary wishes to make clear that the statute does not provide the SPRE the authority under the SPRP
to provide licenses to or legally authorize institutions to operate in a State; the SPRE merely represents State entities
that perform those functions. Similarly, under element (1), paragraph (B), the SPRE must represent any State entity
that is responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with the State's review standards.
Again, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the statute does not provide the SPRE the authority under the SPRP to
ensure that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with the State's review standards; rather the SPRE
must merely represent any State entity that has that responsibility. Moreover, a State is not required, for the purposes
of this part, to create an entity responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance
with the State's review standards if such an entity does not currently exist. These statutory provisions are repeated
in &sect;667.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the entities listed in the statute under element (5), in &sect;667.3(b)(4), the Secretary proposes
to require the SPRE to describe its relationship with any State licensing body, any State-level entity that approves
service providers under the Job Training Partnership Act, and any State-level entity that certifies vocational
education. The Secretary proposes this requirement to ensure that all entities in the State involved with postsecondary
institutions or postsecondary educational programs coordinate with the SPRE actions taken regarding those institutions
or programs. The agreements the Secretary signed with States to implement the SPRP in fiscal year 1993 did not provide
for a description of the SPRE's relationship with these additional entities. Thus, if any changes are required to
be made to the agreement as a result of this proposal or other proposals in these regulations or as a result of public
comment, States will be provided sufficient opportunity to execute new agreements. Any new terms will have a prospective
effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the proposed requirement under element (5), that the agreement describe additional relationships between
the SPRE and other State authorities, the requirements contained in section 494A(b) of the HEA described above are
repeated in &sect;667.3(a) and (b) and therefore cannot be changed by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 494(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to impose the following sanctions on a State if the State does not enter
into an agreement with the Secretary or fails to comply with the terms of the agreement_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Secretary may not designate as eligible for participation in a Title IV, HEA program any institution seeking
initial participation in that program, any branch campus for which an institution seeks an initial designation of
eligibility, or any institution that has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change in control, pursuant
to section 481 of the HEA and subpart 3 of part H of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary may grant only provisional certification to any institution in that State pursuant to subpart 3
of part H of the HEA; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State is ineligible to receive any funds appropriated to carry out the SPRP, its allotment under the SSIG Program,
and any funds appropriated to carry out the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership Program (NEISP).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory sanctions described above are repeated in &sect;667.3(e). The Secretary, also, proposes to impose
the statutory sanctions on a State if the State ends its participation in the SPRP or fails to establish review standards
within two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in &sect;667.3(d)(3), the Secretary proposes to impose the sanctions on a State that ends its participation
in the SPRP by terminating its agreement with the Secretary. The only exception for not participating in the SPRP is
provided in section 494A(c) of the HEA. That section specifies that ``no State shall be required to enter into an agreement
with the Secretary under this subpart for performing review functions required by the agreement unless the Congress
appropriates funds for this subpart''. (The Congress made $5.3 million of fiscal year 1993 funds available to initiate
the SPRP and has appropriated $21.25 million for fiscal year 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, in &sect;667.3(d)(4), the Secretary proposes to impose the sanctions on a State that does not establish
review standards under &sect;667.21 that are not disapproved by the Secretary within two years from the time the State
received Federal funds under this part. The Secretary believes that two years is a reasonable time for a State to establish
review standards. Moreover, because a State must establish review standards before reviews of institutions can
take place, the Secretary believes strongly that a State should not unreasonably delay the conduct of reviews and
continue to receive Federal funds under this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 494(b) of the HEA provides that if a State declines to enter into an agreement with the Secretary to
carry out the purposes of this part, the provisions of this part that refer to the State refer instead to the Secretary
who may make appropriate arrangements with agencies or organizations of demonstrated competence in reviewing institutions
to carry out the provisions of this part. The Secretary proposes to implement this section of the statute in &sect;667.3(e)(2)(iii)(A)
and (B). Thus, in paragraph (A) the Secretary may establish review standards for any State that declines to enter into
an agreement with the Secretary, and in paragraph (B) the Secretary may carry out, or arrange to carry out, the State's
other responsibilities under this part.

Title IV, HEA program to determine if those institutions meet one or more of the review criteria contained in section
494C(b) of the HEA. If an institution meets one or more of the review criteria, the Secretary must refer the institution
to a SPRE for review. The review criteria set forth in section 494C(b) are as follows_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A cohort default rate (as defined in section 435(m) of the HEA) equal to or greater than 25 percent;

The Secretary anticipates making referrals at least annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 494C(a) as amended by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208) further provides
that the Secretary may determine not to refer to a SPRE for review an institution that meets only criterion (10) described
above, if the SPRE previously reviewed that institution under this part and found no violations of the State's review
standards. This provision is repeated in &sect;667.5(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a literal reading of review criteria (6) and (9), the Secretary would have to refer an institution to a SPRE in
perpetuity for an event that happened once. However, the Secretary believes that it is wasteful to require a SPRE to
continually review an institution for the same reason if the SPRE had previously reviewed that institution and found
no violations of its standards. Therefore, in &sect;667.5(c), the Secretary proposes to reserve whether to refer
an institution to a SPRE for review under these two criteria if on the basis of an earlier referral, the SPRE conducted
a review of the institution and found no significant violations of its standards as a result of that review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 494C(c) of the HEA provides that an institution may request confirmation of the data used by the Secretary
to determine that the institution met one or more of the statutory review criteria. In &sect;667.5(e), the Secretary
proposes to rescind a referral if the Secretary confirms that the data used to make the referral were inaccurate and
that a referral would not be made under accurate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When confirming the accuracy of data, the Secretary will presume that records maintained in the ordinary course of
business by the U.S. Department of Education, a guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, the SPRE, the State licensing
agency, or another State agency are accurate unless the institution proves to the Secretary's satisfaction that
the records are not properly maintained or are inaccurate.

In addition to those institutions referred to a State by the Secretary for review as a result of meeting one or more of

The statute further provides that if the Secretary fails to approve or disapprove a State's request to review additional
institutions within 21 days, the State may proceed to review those additional institutions as if approved by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These statutory provisions are repeated in &sect;667.6.

Section 494C(h)(2) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe in regulations a time period within which the Secretary
notifies a SPRE of any actions taken by the Secretary or another Federal agency against an institution located in the
SPRE's State. Accordingly, in &sect;667.7, the Secretary proposes to notify a SPRE within 10 days of taking or learning
of an action against an institution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 667.8 deals with the situation when a referred institution has locations in more than one State. In proposing
procedures for dealing with that situation, the Secretary had to decide which State standards would apply, which
State would conduct the review, and, if more than one State had to conduct a review, how those reviews should be coordinated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.8, the Secretary proposes the following. If an institution is referred for review, the Secretary will
refer the institution to the SPRE in each State in which the institution is located. With the referral, the Secretary
informs each SPRE of the other States in which the institution is located. The main campus of the institution or any
branch campus or additional location of that institution is subject to the review standards of the State in which it
is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed procedures place the principal responsibility for reviewing the institution on the SPRE of the State
in which the main campus of the institution is located. The SPRE of a State in which a branch campus or additional location
of the institution is located may choose among three options to determine when to review that branch campus or additional
location or to determine if review of that branch or additional location is warranted. Under the first option, the
SPRE may review that branch campus or additional location before a review is conducted of the main campus of that institution.
The second option provides that the SPRE may delay its review of that branch campus or additional location until a review
is conducted of the main campus of that institution. Under the last option, if the State's allotment will not allow
the SPRE to review all referred institutions, the SPRE may choose not to review that branch campus or additional location
if the SPRE of the State in which the main campus of that institution is located reviews that institution and makes no
significant findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes that SPREs may agree among themselves to alter these review requirements. Thus,
if the institution was located in a metropolitan area such as Washington, DC and had its main campus in Washington,
DC and branch campuses in Virginia and Maryland, the Washington, DC, Virginia, and Maryland SPREs could agree among
themselves that the Virginia SPRE would review all the institution's locations. However, the applicable review
standards would not change. Therefore, to the extent that the three jurisdictions had different standards, the Washington,
DC locations would be subject to the Washington, DC standards, the Maryland locations would be subject to the Maryland
standards and the Virginia locations would be subject to the Virginia standards.

Section 667.11&blank;Allotment Formula
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 494(a)(2) of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to provide Federal funds to a SPRE for performing the functions
contained in the State's agreement with the Secretary. Accordingly, in &sect;667.11, the Secretary proposes a funding
formula under which the Secretary allots annually to each SPRE its share of the Federal funds appropriated for the
SPRP. The following discusses the proposed funding formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each fiscal year that Federal funds are appropriated for the SPRP, the Secretary proposes to allot $20,000 to Guam,
$20,000 to the Northern Mariana Islands, $20,000 to the Virgin Islands, $20,000 to the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands (Palau), and $20,000 to American Samoa. The Secretary believes this amount is sufficient for these States
to carry out SPRE activities because only three institutions are located in Guam, and only one institution is located
in each of the other jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to allot the remaining fiscal year appropriation so that each remaining State receives the
greater of $50,000, or the amount determined under a formula that uses the following two variables_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The number of institutions located in a State that are certified to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount of Title IV, HEA program funds made available to students enrolled in those institutions during the
latest year for which complete data is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the formula, the Title IV, HEA programs only include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Family Education
Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Loan, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study
(FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes the formula described in greater detail in &sect;667.11(a) because the Secretary believes
that each State needs at least $50,000 to carry out SPRE activities. In addition, at least in the initial years of the
program, the Secretary believes it equitable to allot Federal funds to States based on the relative exposure of Title
IV, HEA program funds in each State as represented by the two variables in the proposed funding formula. However, after
several years, when there is a history of referrals to States and SPRE reviews of institutions as a result of those referrals,
the Secretary plans to reexamine the funding formula to determine whether to base the formula on the percentage of
referrals each State receives, the number of reviews each State performs, or a combination of those two variables.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.11(b), the Secretary proposes to reallot Federal funds not expended by a State to other States in a manner
that best carries out the purposes of the program. The Secretary proposes to reallot those funds the Secretary determines
a State will not spend during the period for which those funds are available, and those funds a State does not spend by
the end of the period for which those funds are made available.

Section 667.12&blank;Application for Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.12, the Secretary proposes procedures under which a State applies to receive its allotment for each
fiscal year in which Congress appropriates funds for the State Postsecondary Review Program. Under these procedures,
a State's application for funds consists of a plan to carry out specific activities and a budget that accounts for those
activities. The Secretary views these application procedures as satisfying the requirement in section 494A(b)(5)
of the HEA that a State include in its agreement with the Secretary its plan to carry out SPRE activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes a two-phased State application process. In the first phase, a State applies for funds to develop
review standards and to carry out other activities that are necessary before the SPRE conducts reviews of referred
institutions. In the second phase, a State applies for funds to conduct reviews of referred institutions and to perform
other allowable activities. A State may apply for funds in the second phase only after it has established review standards.
The Secretary considers a State to have established review standards if those standards were developed in accordance
with the requirements contained in &sect;667.21 and those standards were not disapproved by the Secretary under
&sect;667.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application before standards are established. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For this phase of the application process, in &sect;667.12(b), the Secretary proposes that the State submit a plan
to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Develop the State review standards described in section 494C(d) of the HEA and discussed further in &sect;&sect;667.21
and 667.22 of this preamble; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Develop procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from students, faculty, and others regarding
an institution, as required by section 494C(j) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the standards and the complaint procedures must be developed in consultation with institutions in the State,
as required under sections 494C(d) and 494C(j) of the HEA, respectively. In addition, the State may submit a plan to
identify information systems maintained by institutions and State agencies that are relevant to developing State
review standards. Finally, the plan may contain estimates of the costs of coordinating those information systems
with an information system for the SPRE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes these allowable activities because the SPRE cannot carry out a review of an institution to
determine whether the institution is in compliance with State standards until the State has developed those standards
in required consultation with institutions in that State. Similarly, a State cannot process complaints until it
has developed procedures, in required consultation with institutions in the State, to respond to complaints. Finally,
a State cannot determine whether it will be cost-effective to coordinate existing data systems without first determining
the costs of coordinating those systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several negotiators suggested that the Secretary specify the manner in which States were to consult with institutions
in their State while developing State standards and complaint procedures. The Secretary believes that each State
is in a better position than the Secretary to determine the most appropriate consultation method for that State. Moreover,
the Secretary believes that States should be able to select from a variety of consultation formats when developing
its standards and complaint procedures with the institutions in its State. Therefore, the Secretary has not specified
the type of required consultation under this section. However, the Secretary expects a State's consultation process
to be thorough and inclusive of the range and types of institutions in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With its plan, the State must submit a budget for carrying out the allowable activities. In &sect;667.12(b)(2), the
Secretary proposes that a State carry out the allowable activities in a priority order if the State anticipates that
the cost of carrying out all those activities will exceed its allotment. Specifically, the Secretary proposes that
a State first use its allotment to develop review standards. If a portion of the allotment remains after the State has
developed its review standards, the State may develop procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from
students, faculty, and others regarding institutions in the State. Finally, the State may use any remaining portion
of its allotment to provide costs estimates for the SPRE's information system after it has completed its review standards
and complaint procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Congress made $5.3 million of fiscal year 1993 funds available to initiate the State Postsecondary Review Program.
Under a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 14, 1993, 58 FR 38022&hyph;38025, the Secretary has allotted those funds to States for the purposes set forth
in &sect;667.12(b). Therefore, except for the following provision, the Secretary acknowledges that most States
will have complied with the provisions contained in &sect;667.12(b) when these provisions are published as final
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not establish review standards with its fiscal year 1993 allotment, the Secretary proposes that the
funds it may receive in any future fiscal year for those activities may not exceed the amount it received or was scheduled
to receive in fiscal year 1993. The Secretary proposes this provision because the Secretary believes that the primary
purpose of the State Postsecondary Review Program is SPRE reviews of institutions and that the funds allotted to States
in fiscal year 1993 were adequate to develop review standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application after standards are established. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the second phase of the application process, the Secretary proposes in &sect;667.12(c) that a State submit_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A plan to review referred institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A plan to carry out the activities described in &sect;667.14; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A budget for those reviews and activities that does not exceed the State's allotment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that a State's allotment of funds may be inadequate to review all the institutions that
must be reviewed under &sect;&sect;667.5 and 667.6. Therefore, in &sect;667.12(c)(2), the Secretary proposes
that a SPRE submit, as part of its plan, a priority system for selecting institutions for review from among the referred
institutions if the SPRE anticipates that the cost of reviewing all the referred institutions will exceed the State's
allotment. The Secretary proposes to provide maximum flexibility to States in selecting institutions to review,
except as limited by section 494A(b)(2) of the HEA. That section requires States to review referred institutions
on a schedule that coincides with the dates set by the Secretary to recertify those institutions to participate in
the Title IV, HEA programs. However, the Secretary expects States to establish review priorities that reflect the
objectives of protecting students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests public comment on the potential benefits of developing specific criteria for States to consider
in determining their review priorities and the nature of those criteria.

In &sect;667.13(a), the Secretary proposes to approve a State's plan and budget for the first phase of the SPRP, the
development of standards and complaint procedures in consultation with institutions in the State, if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State's plan provides a reasonable basis, and adequate budget justification, for conducting those activities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State's plan provides for conducting those activities in the priority order proposed in &sect;667.12(b)(2);
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State's budget includes only reasonable allowable costs within the State's fiscal year 1993 allotment. The

the review of referred institutions, if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State's plan provides adequate budget justification for carrying out the activities proposed and described
in &sect;667.14 within its allotment,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State's plan provides a reasonable scheme for reviewing referred institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any contract the State proposes to enter into with another agency to carry out SPRE functions, as provided in section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State that does not submit an application for funds under &sect;667.12 or does not submit an approvable application,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by sections 494A(c) and 494B of the HEA, a State is not required to expend any funds under the SPRP to carry
out allowable activities unless the Secretary reimburses the State for the costs it incurs in carrying out those activities.
To the extent appropriations are available the Secretary proposes to reimburse a State for the direct and indirect
costs of carrying out allowable SPRE activities if those activities are included in a plan that is approved by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``direct costs'' and ``indirect costs'' are defined in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular
A&hyph;87. In addition, the Secretary proposes to rely on the cost principles described in OMB Circular A&hyph;87
for determining allowable costs under the State Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to consider as allowable activities those activities that are directly related to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Establishing State review standards in consultation with institutions in the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Publicizing and providing initial and continuing training to State and other personnel in the State, including
personnel at the institution subject to review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Establishing and implementing procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from students, faculty,

In &sect;667.15, the Secretary proposes requirements regarding a State's use and accounting of the Federal funds
it receives under this part. To minimize burden on States, the Secretary proposes that a State account for funds it
receives under this part in accordance with the procedures it uses to account for its own funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary proposes that a State keep fiscal and accounting records that support, on audit, its expenditure
of funds under this part and maintain those records for five years. Finally, the Secretary proposes that a State must
have an audit performed of the SPRE's activities under this part at least once every two years. An audit conducted under
the Single Agency Audit Act satisfies this audit requirement.

Section 494C(d) of the HEA requires a State to develop review standards, in consultation with the institutions in
the State, that are consistent with the laws and constitution of the State. A State's authority to develop review standards
is further clarified in section 494C(g) of the HEA. That section prohibits the Secretary from requiring a State to
establish review standards that are unrelated to ensuring institutional or program integrity or that violate the
provisions of the State's constitution or laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SPRE reviews referred institutions under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-developed standards set forth in section 494C(d) of the HEA. In conducting its review, the SPRE must determine
whether a referred institution has complied with standards that address the following areas_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The availability to students and prospective students of catalogs, admissions requirements, course outlines,
schedules of tuition and fees, policies regarding course cancellations, and the rules and regulations of the institution
relating to students and the accuracy of such catalogs and course outlines in reflecting the courses and programs
offered by the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assurance that the institution has a method to assess a student's ability to successfully complete the course
of study for which he or she has applied; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assurance that the institution maintains and enforces standards relating to academic progress and maintains
adequate student and other records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Compliance by the institution with relevant safety and health standards, such as fire, building, and sanitation
codes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The financial and administrative capacity of the institution as appropriate to a specified scale of operations
and the maintenance of adequate financial and other information necessary to determine the financial and administrative
capacity of the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For institutions financially at risk, the adequacy of provisions to provide for the instruction of students and
to provide for the retention and accessibility of academic and financial aid records of students in the event the institution
closes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the stated objectives of the courses or programs of the institution are to prepare students for employment,
the relationship of the tuition and fees to the remuneration that can be reasonably expected by students who complete
the course or program and the relationship of the courses or programs (including the appropriateness of the length
of such courses) to providing the student with quality training and useful employment in recognized occupations
in the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The rates of the institution's students' program completion and graduation, taking into account the length of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) the variety of student completion goals, including transfer to another institution of higher education, full-time
employment in the field of study, and military service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the following standard, the statutory provisions contained in section 494C(d) of the HEA are essentially
repeated in &sect;667.21(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(a)(4), the Secretary proposed to interpret the standard described in 494C(d)(2) of the HEA to require
that a judgement be made regarding the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess a student's ability to complete
successfully an educational program. The proposed standard would require a SPRE to measure the effectiveness of
its assessment method by the completion rate of the assessed students enrolled in the institution's program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators indicated that the proposed standard implies a highly predictive association between the institution's
assessment method and the students' completion of the program. According to those negotiators, such a predictive
association does not exist. Therefore, the negotiators suggested that the success of the institution's assessment
method be judged by using measures other than completion rates. The Secretary invites comments on this suggestion
and alternative approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess a student's ability
to complete successfully an educational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the standard described in section 494C(d)(4) of the HEA and &sect;667.21(a)(7), the Secretary invites
public comments on whether the SPRE's review of an institution should include a review of the institution's compliance
with statutes and regulations governing access to disabled individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(b), the Secretary has proposed a framework under which a State develops review standards. Under
that framework the Secretary proposes_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To permit States to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions and educational
programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That States specify the records that referred institutions would need to maintain to satisfy State standards;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That States must quantify certain review standards; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That States determine whether a Title IV, HEA program standard would be an adequate State standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negotiators disagreed among themselves with regard to the proposal in &sect;667.22(b)(1), to provide latitude
to States to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions or educational programs.
While many negotiators agreed strongly with this approach, others disagreed vociferously, arguing that States
would use this latitude to establish unreasonably stringent standards for vocational and proprietary institutions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes the statute does not prohibit the establishment of different standards for different institutions
and therefore does not wish to preclude a State from establishing such standards, provided the State can adequately
justify that different standards are more appropriate than uniform standards for the institutions in its State.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(b)(2), the Secretary proposes that a State establish standards that specify the records and information
a referred institution would need to maintain to demonstrate to a SPRE the institution's compliance with those standards.
The Secretary wishes to make clear that technically, only a referred institution is subject to the recordkeeping
requirements specified in the State's standards unless, as discussed previously in &sect;667.3 of this preamble,
the State has or creates an entity that is responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance
with those standards. Otherwise, a nonreferred institution may choose not to maintain the specified records. However,
that institution would risk losing its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs if as a result of some future event
it triggered a statutory review criterion, and was unable to produce the records required to demonstrate to the SPRE
its compliance with the State's standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, concern has been raised regarding a State's authority to collect information from all institutions
in the State for the purpose of establishing review standards. For example, a State may establish on an annual basis
a student graduation rate standard that is equal to the average graduation rate of students at all institutions in
the State. While the Secretary believes that this method of establishing review standards is reasonable and appropriate,
a State does not have the authority under the SPRP to require all institutions in the State to report standards-related
information to the SPRE. Notwithstanding this limitation, the Secretary encourages all institutions to comply
with a request from a SPRE for this information, particularly if the only alternative available to the SPRE is to establish
arbitrary standards. The Secretary wishes to make clear, however, that a SPRE has the authority under section 494C(d)
of the HEA to require standards-related information from all referred institutions in the State. The Secretary notes
that if a State standard is based upon an average, such as an average graduation rate, there must be a sufficient number
of institutions providing data to support that rate, and the reporting institutions should be representative of
the institutions located in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(b)(4), the Secretary proposes that a State must quantify certain review standards. Thus, for the
standard described in section 494C(d)(7) of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(10), the Secretary proposes
that a State establish an acceptable percentage for the relationship between the tuition and fees charged by an institution
for an educational program and the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that program actually
earns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, for the standard described in section 494C(d)(14) of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(18), the
Secretary proposes that a State establish acceptable percentages for_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The completion and graduation rates of students enrolled in educational programs offered by an institution;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The withdrawal rate of students at an institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) With respect to an institution's vocational and professional programs, the placement rate of the institution's
graduates in occupations related to their educational program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The rate or rates at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of these areas, the acceptable percentage sets the level above which a SPRE must consider an institution to
be in compliance with the review standard, and below which a SPRE makes either a finding of noncompliance or conducts
a further review of the institution to account for the reasons the institution failed to meet that percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that developing such standards will be difficult and will therefore allow States great
flexibility in developing these quantifiable standards, both in terms of the methods used to determine an acceptable
percentage and the actual acceptable percentage. Moreover, the Secretary wishes to reiterate that the acceptable
percentage that a State establishes should reflect whether an institution is successfully providing its educational
programs to its students rather than whether the institution should automatically be terminated from participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs solely because it failed to satisfy that standard. The Secretary also reiterates that
a State need not recommend the termination of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs solely
because the institution failed to meet any particular State standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.21(b)(5) the Secretary proposes to require a State to determine the extent to which it is appropriate
to base a State review standard on a related Title IV, HEA program standard or requirement or to establish as the State's
review standard the comparable Title IV, HEA standard or requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes it is imperative that States take into consideration the standards and requirements institutions
must satisfy to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs before increasing the burden on those institutions by adopting
entirely new standards for this part. In this regard, the Secretary expects States to avoid establishing standards
that are weaker than similar Title IV, HEA program standards that an institution must otherwise satisfy to participate
in those programs. In addition, when the Secretary publishes regulations implementing the Student-Right-to-Know
provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA, the Secretary expects States to adopt the methodology contained in those
regulations for calculating student completion and graduation rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the convenience of the reader, the following Title IV, HEA program standards and requirements are related or comparable

information necessary to substantiate the truthfulness of the advertisement, and any State licensing requirements
for a job for which the institution's educational program prepares such students; and the provisions in section 487(a)(20)
of the HEA prohibiting an institution from paying a commission, bonus, or other incentive based on securing enrollments
to any person engaged in student recruiting or admission activities;

programs of less than 600 clock-hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that many of the referenced Title IV, HEA program standards will be revised or recodified
in the near future as additional regulations are published implementing changes made in the HEA by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites public comment regarding the development of standards under the proposed framework and on
alternative approaches that would assure the development of meaningful and rigorous standards. Specifically,
the Secretary seeks comment on ways to establish common methodologies for computing quantitative standards, and
common recordkeeping requirements associated with those standards, among institutions in all States, and among
the three members of the Integrity triad in a manner that reduces the administrative burden on institutions and the
triad. In addition, the Secretary invites comments on approaches that would minimize extreme disparities in standards
between States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 494C(d) of the HEA, State-developed standards are ``subject to disapproval by the Secretary.'' In
accordance with that section of the HEA, in &sect;667.22, the Secretary proposes procedures under which the Secretary
evaluates a State's review standards to determine whether to disapprove those standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, in &sect;667.22(a), a State must submit to the Secretary its review standards along with an explanation
of how each standard was established, including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A description of the manner in which institutions in the State were consulted in the development of the standards;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An explanation of the relationship between each of the State's review standards and the related or comparable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program standards or requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If applicable, an explanation of the reasons for establishing different review standards for different types
of institutions or educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.22(b), the Secretary proposes criteria to determine whether to disapprove a State's review standards.
Specifically, the Secretary proposes to disapprove a State's review standards if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State does not assure the Secretary that the State's review standards are consistent with the laws and constitution
of that State, as required by section 494C(d) of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State does not submit evidence that the State's review standards were developed in consultation with institutions
in that State, as required in section 494C(d) of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State's review standards do not meet or exceed all of the requirements and cover all the areas described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 494C(d) of the HEA and &sect;667.21; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The standards the State quantified under &sect;667.21(b)(4) do not meet certain procedural and statistical
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in &sect;667.22(c), if the Secretary disapproves a State's review standards, the Secretary proposes to
give the State the reasons for that disapproval and proposes to provide the State an opportunity to either demonstrate
why the Secretary's disapproval was incorrect or submit revised standards that address the reasons for the Secretary's
disapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites public comment regarding the proposed evaluation criteria and on additional criteria the
Secretary should use to evaluate a State's review standards.

Section 667.23&blank;SPRE Reviews of Institutions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.23, the Secretary proposes procedures regarding SPRE reviews of referred institutions. In general,
if the Secretary refers an institution to a SPRE for review under &sect;667.5, or the SPRE selects an institution for
review under &sect;667.6 and the Secretary approves that selection, the SPRE reviews, or arranges for the review
of, that institution to determine whether the institution is in compliance with the State review standards described
in &sect;667.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the part of section 494C(d) of the HEA that requires a SPRE to review referred institutions in accordance
with published State standards, in &sect;667.23(b), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE provide written notice
of the State's established review standards to each institution in the State before the SPRE conducts reviews of referred
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.23(c), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE issue a report of its findings and provide it to the institution
no later than 45 days after the SPRE completes its review. For each finding contained in the report, the SPRE must cite
the standard violated and cite the nature of the violation. The SPRE may prescribe, if necessary, a course of action
the institution must follow to correct the violation, or the SPRE may determine that the institution should no longer
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. If the SPRE chooses to prescribe a corrective action, the Secretary proposes
to give the SPRE sole discretion to determine an appropriate period for the institution to correct the violation and
bring itself into compliance with the State's review standards. Alternatively, if the SPRE determines that the institution
should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, as provided in section 494C(h) of the HEA, the SPRE may initiate
the process described in &sect;667.25, under which the Secretary ultimately terminates the institution's participation
in those programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.23(d), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE give the institution an opportunity to respond to its findings
and required actions. If the institution chooses to respond within the time permitted by the SPRE, in &sect;667.23(e),
the Secretary proposes that the SPRE evaluate the institution's response and issue a final report to the institution
that includes its findings and required action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 494C(h)(1) provides that a SPRE must notify the Secretary of its findings and the actions the SPRE is taking,
or has taken, in response to those findings within a time period prescribed by the Secretary in regulations. Therefore,
in &sect;667.23(f), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE provide to the Secretary a copy of its final report to an institution
within 30 days of its issuance to the institution. A final report includes the report that the SPRE produces after the
institution responds to its initial findings. However, if the institution does not respond to the SPRE's initial
report in the time permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE's initial report becomes its final report on the day after the deadline
date provided to the institution for responding to that report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.23(g), the Secretary proposes that a SPRE may determine that an institution should no longer participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs for reasons other than the institution's failure to meet the State's review standards.
Specifically, a SPRE may initiate a proceeding to effect the termination of the institution's participation in the
Title IV, HEA programs under &sect;667.25, if that institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does not respond to the SPRE's findings or required actions within the time permitted by the SPRE and the SPRE's
findings show serious violations of the State's standards; (2) Does not allow SPRE personnel at the institution;
or (3) Fails to provide SPRE officials with prompt access to its documents and records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary wishes to make clear that these proposed regulations do not require a SPRE to take specific actions against
an institution that fails to meet a State's review standards. The Secretary believes strongly that SPREs be afforded
the latitude to prescribe appropriate corrective actions, or, if the SPRE finds that an institution has continuously
or egregiously violated the State's standards, make the determination that the institution should no longer participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs. On the other hand, the Secretary would be concerned if a SPRE failed consistently to prescribe
appropriate and adequate corrective actions for institutions that did not satisfy the State's standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Secretary intends to add to this section a requirement that a SPRE establish performance standards that
would enable the Secretary to evaluate the conduct and quality of the SPRE's reviews. Public comment is invited regarding
the specific areas where SPRE performance standards should be established and how that performance should be evaluated.

Section 667.24&blank;Peer Reviews of Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each referred institution, section 494C(d)(15) of the HEA requires a SPRE to contract with a nationally recognized
accrediting agency or other peer review system with demonstrated competence in assessing educational programs
to carry out a review or provide information to the SPRE regarding that agency's or system's assessment of the quality
and content of the institution educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a literal reading of this provision, a SPRE could contract with the accrediting agency that had previously accredited
the referred institution for the latter to conduct another, limited accreditation review. Under normal circumstances,
the Secretary believes that use of SPRP funds for that activity would not be a prudent use of those funds. Therefore,
under normal circumstances, the Secretary recommends that a SPRE satisfy the requirements of section 494C(d)(15)
of the HEA by contracting with the referred institution's accrediting agency for the latter to provide a copy of the
relevant information that was included in connection with its previous grant of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the proposal that allows a SPRE to contract with a peer review system that it determines has competence in
assessing educational programs, the provisions in section 494C(d)(15) are repeated in &sect;667.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators argued that the Secretary should define the term ``peer review system'' or specify criteria
to determine the competence of a peer review system. Those negotiators believed strongly that a peer review system
selected by a SPRE would not be a credible authority in assessing postsecondary educational programs because that
peer review system would not be subject to the requirements and standards imposed on accrediting agencies in subpart
2 of Part H of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One negotiator suggested specific criteria to determine the competence of a peer review system. In particular, that
negotiator suggested that the Secretary approve a peer review system if that system demonstrates that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The geographical scope of the system's activities covers a State, region, or the United States; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The system has the administrative and fiscal capability to carry out its activities in light of the system's objectives
and scope; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The system has established standards and adequate experience to assess the quality and content of institutions'
programs of instruction, training, or study in relation to achieving the stated objectives for which the courses
or programs are offered;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The system has effective mechanisms for evaluating compliance with its standards and applying its standards
consistently; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (5) The system's activities will meet the needs of the State and the Secretary in accomplishing the purposes of the
SPRP and not unnecessarily duplicate the capabilities of a nationally recognized accrediting agency available
to perform the assessment described in &sect;667.24(b) of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Secretary believes that a peer review system for purposes of this program does not, in effect, have to qualify as
a recognized accrediting agency to be used under the SPRP. Nevertheless, the Secretary invites comment on these suggested
criteria and alternative approaches for determining the competence of a peer review system.

Section 667.25&blank;Termination of an Institution's Participation in the Title IV, HEA Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.25, the Secretary proposes the procedures a SPRE must follow to effect the termination of an institution's
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Under those procedures, if a SPRE determines, based upon its review,
that an institution is in violation of the State's review standards and should no longer continue to participate in
the Title IV, HEA programs or violates one of the provisions proposed in &sect;667.23(g), the SPRE provides the institution
with the opportunity to contest that determination in accordance with procedures the Secretary has approved for
that purpose under &sect;667.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the SPRE concludes after affording the institution the opportunity to challenge the SPRE's findings and determination,
that the institution should be terminated from participating in the Title IV, HEA Programs, the SPRE notifies the
Secretary of those findings and that determination. Upon notice by the SPRE that the institution should no longer
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary immediately terminates that institution's participation
in those programs and notifies the institution and the SPRE of the effective date of that termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Secretary proposes that an institution terminated under this part may not reapply to the Secretary to
participate in a Title IV, HEA program until 18 months have expired from the effective date of its termination. This
proposal is consistent with the provisions in 34 CFR 668.96. Under that section of the Title IV, HEA program regulations,
an institution whose participation in the Title IV, HEA programs has been terminated may not seek reinstatement in
those programs before the expiration of 18 months from the effective date of its termination. Moreover, section 494C(h)(1)
of the HEA does not authorize any appeal to the Secretary of a termination determination.

Section 667.26 Due Process Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 494C(h)(3) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe in regulations minimum procedural standards for
the disapproval of institutions by a SPRE. Thus, in &sect;667.26, the Secretary proposes due process criteria that
a State must satisfy when permitting an institution to challenge a SPRE's finding that the institution is in violation
of the State's review standards and should no longer continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Secretary proposes to approve the State's procedures if those procedures satisfy basic due process
requirements. Therefore, the Secretary proposes procedures that require the SPRE to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify an institution of any required action and the basis for that action; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Permit the institution the opportunity to challenge that adverse action in a hearing or in writing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notify the institution in writing of the result of its challenge, and the basis for that result; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Follow other applicable procedural requirements of State law.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Because these proposed regulations would affect only States and State agencies, the regulations
would not have an impact on small entities. State and State agencies are not defined as ``small entities'' in the Regulatory
Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 667.3, 667.4, 667.12, 667.15, 667.21, and 667.22 contain information collection requirements. As required
by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office
of Management and Budget for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations contain information collection requirements for States that apply to the Secretary
to receive funds under this part and for States that develop review standards and submit those standards to the Secretary
for approval. The Department needs and uses the information collected to determine whether to approve a State's application
for funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1480 hours for each of the
57 States that prepare plans to perform SPRE activities, prepare budgets that account for those activities, develop
review standards, and submit those plans, budgets, and standards to the Secretary for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,

(a)(1) This part establishes the rules and procedures that govern the State Postsecondary Review Program, which
is authorized under Title IV, Part H, Subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The purpose of
the program is to strengthen State oversight of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs through
the development of State standards for those institutions, and State review under those standards of institutions
referred by the Secretary under &sect;667.5 or selected by the State under &sect;667.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Under this part, if a State finds that an institution it reviews does not satisfy the State standards, the State
may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Require the institution to take prompt actions to bring itself into compliance with the State's standards; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Determine that the institution should no longer participate in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A State must carry out activities under this part only to the extent that the costs of those activities will be reimbursed
by Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As used in this part, ``an institution'' includes_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An institution of higher education as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR 600.4; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A proprietary institution of higher education as defined in 34 CFR 600.5; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A postsecondary vocational institution as defined in 34 CFR 600.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The provisions in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations, State Administered Programs,
34 CFR Part 76, do not apply to this part except for the provisions in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 34 CFR 76.1, 76.2, and 76.50 of subpart A; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 34 CFR 76.500 through 76.534, 76.561, 76.563, and 76.580 through 76.592 of Subpart F; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The SPRE shall provide written notice to all institutions in the State of the review standards approved by the Secretary

the SPRE_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Must cite the standard violated and the nature of the violation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) May_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prescribe, if necessary, a course of action the institution must follow to correct the violation. The SPRE has

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the institution did not respond to the SPRE's initial report by the date permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE must provide
to the Secretary a copy of its initial report. The SPRE's initial report becomes its final report on the day after the
date provided to the institution for responding to that report; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Appendix A to Preamble._Major Issues Discussed at the Regional Meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department convened four regional meetings in September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development
of regulations to implement Title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher
Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325. This subpart describes the rules and procedures that govern
the State Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department invited individuals and representatives of groups involved in student financial assistance programs
to the four regional meetings. At each meeting, the Department provided for a comprehensive discussion and exchange
of information regarding the implementation of subpart 1 by providing participants with an issue paper that raised
issues and questions with regard to the statutory provisions included in subpart 1. The following is a summary of the
information provided to the Department by participants at the regional meetings. The section of the proposed regulations
that is the subject of the information is provided as a reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time requirement for development of State review standards_&sect;667.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the regional meetings discussed whether the Secretary should require States to develop review standards
within a specified time. The participants agreed that the Secretary should specify a time period but disagreed on
what that time period should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allotment formula_&sect;667.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed how Federal funds should be divided among the States that have entered into an agreement with
the Secretary and suggested a funding scheme under which each participating State would receive (1) an allotment
sufficient to carry out minimum SPRE activities, and (2) a supplemental allotment based on the number of institutions
in the State, the total Title IV, HEA program funds made available to students attending institutions in the State,
or the number institutions referred to the State by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable costs and activities_&sect;667.14. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed the extent to which a State should be reimbursed for the costs of performing reviews and other
activities and suggested that the Secretary reimburse the State for the direct and indirect costs of SPRE review activities,
including salaries and fringe benefits, travel and other review costs, costs for developing State review standards
and complaint procedures, and litigation costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consultation with institutions_&sect;667.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether the Secretary should establish procedures that a State must use to consult with institutions
in its State in the development of State review standards. They recommended that the Secretary suggest, but not establish,
consultation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal minimum review standards_&sect;667.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether the Secretary should establish Federal minimum standards and whether a State could
establish standards that are weaker than comparable standards that govern an institution's eligibility and participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs. The participants were divided on the first issue; the majority argued that Federal minimums
would not be appropriate because they could not be developed in a manner that would adequately account for the mission
and diversity of all postsecondary institutions. With respect to the second issue, some participants felt that a
State should have the flexibility to develop weaker standards, while others felt that no distinction should be made
between a ``weaker'' standard or a ``different'' standard. Those participants felt that a State should be able to
develop different standards for different types of institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantifiable standards_&sect;667.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether a State should quantify review standards and suggested that, to the extent that standards
could be quantified, they should be quantified. However, most participants felt that the State should have the flexibility
to establish the level at which an institution would be considered to be in violation of the quantified standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPRE review findings_&sect;667.23. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether a SPRE should be required to determine that an institution should no longer participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs based on the institution's failure to satisfy a particular State standard. Most participants
felt that a SPRE could, but should not be required to, make that determination. The participants suggested that, based
on the nature and severity of an institution's violations, the SPRE should have the latitude to take an adverse action
against the institution or to require the institution to take actions to bring itself into compliance with the State's
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disapproval of State review standards_&sect;667.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed the basis under which the Secretary should disapprove a State's review standards. Most participants
felt that the Secretary should disapprove a State's standards only if those standards did not adequately address
the statutory requirements.

The Forest Service will analyze and disclose the environmental impacts of a proposal to harvest timber, regenerate
harvested timber stands, rehabilitate existing sediment sources, reconstruct existing roads, and construct new
roads in a portion of the West Fork Squaw Creek and Spring Creek drainages on the Powell Ranger District. An environmental
impact statement (EIS) will be prepared which will document the analysis. This EIS will tier to the Clearwater National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Final EIS of September 1987, which provides overall guidance in achieving
the desired condition for the area. The primary purpose and need of the proposed action is to implement land management
direction for the West Fork Squaw Creek and Spring Creek drainages. The goal is to develop a viable timber sale proposal
that is compatible with current resource management objectives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis area in which the proposed management activities would occur consists of approximately 3,650 acres
of National Forest land in the West Fork of Squaw Creek and Spring Creek drainage on the Powell Ranger District. The
study area includes all or portions of Sections 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 24 of T37N, R12E and Sections 6, 7, 18, and 19,
of T37N, R13E, Boise Meridian, Idaho County, Idaho.

The Land and Resource Management Plan for the Clearwater National Forest provides the overall guidance for management
activities in the potentially affected area through its goals, objectives, standards, guidelines and management
area direction. In the West Fork Squaw Creek analysis area, four Forest Plan Management Areas are found: E1 which emphasized
optimum timber management, M2 which emphasizes protection of riparian values, A6 which emphasizes the cultural
and visual resources from the historic trail corridor, and US which is lands unsuitable for timber production. The
areas of proposed timber harvest, regeneration and associated road construction and reconstruction activities
are located in Management Area E1, which emphasizes optimum sustained timber production.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date, considerable scoping and analysis has been done in regard to the proposed action. In April 1991 the staff of
the Powell Ranger District began an Integrated Resource Analysis (IRA) of the West Fork of Squaw Creek (Silvicultural
compartment 621) to identify the existing and desired conditions. During December of 1991, a Position Statement
was sent to the staff of the Clearwater National Forest, State agencies, the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee,
and other known local interest groups and individuals informing the public of the analysis and seeking comment. In
January 1992, an Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) was assigned to continue the analysis after receiving a number of comments
during the initial scoping phase. This team identified the primary issues in February 1992 after reviewing the input
received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The key issues identified by the Interdisciplinary Team are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Scenery_Proposed logging and road construction may influence, either positively or negatively, the view from
the Lolo Trail Corridor, which consists of the Lolo motorway, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, and the Lewis &amp;
Clark National Historic Landmark.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Fisheries and Water Quality_Proposed logging and road construction will be analyzed for sediment production
and potential mitigation measures to determine effects on the west fork and mainstem of Squaw Creek (recently recovered
to minimum Forest Plan standards) affecting the Spring/Summer Chinook salmon and the bull trout.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Old Growth, Wildlife, and Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Species_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Old Growth_Proposed logging and road construction may reduce the level of old-growth habitat in the analysis area
and further fragment corridors linking areas of old-growth habitat. Potential Old Growth stands within or adjacent
to proposed activities will be field verified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife_Timber harvesting and road construction may create new openings, decreasing suitable habitat needed
for wildlife. Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Species_Timber harvesting and road construction may affect
Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive species or their habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Timber Management_Proposed logging may increase overall stand productivity by removing timber which has reached
biological maturity and by removing timber which is infected with bark beetles and disease pathogens. Proposed logging
would also contribute timber to the local and National timber supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Economics_Proposed logging and environmental protection measures may affect the economic viability of a timber
sale offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the identified issues and concerns, the IDT has described four management alternatives. One of these
is the ``no-action'' alternative in which timber harvest, timber stand regeneration, and road construction/reconstruction
activities would not be implemented. Three other alternatives will examine various levels and locations of timber
harvest, rehabilitation of active sediment sources, and road construction/reconstruction activity. Various
mixes of timber and non-timber resource values of each alternative will also be examined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the action alternatives that the Interdisciplinary Team has described to this point, timber harvest ranges
from 1.9 to 3.9 million board feet (MMBF), with harvest directly affecting from 323 to 472 acres. To access proposed
harvest units, up to 0.9 mile of new road construction and no road reconstruction would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preliminary analysis indicates that tentative alternatives may have significant effects to the environment.
The Responsible Official, Margaret J. Gorski, Powell District Ranger, has decided to continue the analysis and document
it with an Environmental Impact Statement. Due to changed environmental conditions, the proposed action is changed
from the original position statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service is now seeking further information and comments from Federal, State, local agencies, and other
individuals or organizations who are interested in or affected by the proposed action. This additional input will
be used in preparing the Draft EIS (DEIS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process will include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Identification of additional potential issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Identification of issues to be analyzed in depth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Elimination of insignificant issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Identification of additional reasonable alternatives.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Determination of potential cooperating agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will disclose the environmental effects of alternative ways of implementing the Forest Plan. The Forest Service
will analyze and document the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the alternatives. In addition, the EIS
will disclose site specific mitigation measures and their expected effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation will be especially important at several points in the analysis. People are encouraged to visit
with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. A Final EIS is expected to be
filed in November 1994. Two key time periods have been identified for receipt of formal comments on the analysis: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Scoping period (now through January 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Review of the Draft EIS in June 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of Interior, will be informally consulted throughout the analysis.
To meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will review the EIS and Biological
Assessment of the effects on Threatened and Endangered species, including the grizzly bear, gray wolf, and fall chinook
salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review by
May 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the DEIS in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After a 45-day public comment period, the comments received will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service
in the final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by November 1994. The Forest
Service will respond in the FEIS to the comments received on the DEIS. The responsible official is the District Ranger
of the Powell Ranger District, Clearwater National Forest, Lolo, Montana 59847. The decision and reasons for the
decision will be documented in a Record of Decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer
to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as required by the National Environmental
Quality Act (NEPA). The proposed project is to evaluate a 10-Year Plan of Operations submitted by G. Antolini and Son
for continuing quarrying operations at the Colson Quarry. The quarry is located on the Santa Lucia Ranger District,
Los Padres National Forest, Santa Barbara County, California. The proposal could result in the approval of the proposed
Operating Plan and the issuance of a Contract for the Sale of Mineral Materials to G. Antolini and Son. Operating period
could be for as little as five years or as long as ten years. Proposed operating volume is an annual maximum of two thousand
tons.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The project has been proposed by G. Antolini and Son, in order to continue quarrying operations inside approximately
fifty acres of National Forest System lands on the Los Padres National Forest. The proposed operation would involve
additional open-pit mining of decorative building stone from approximately eighteen acres of National Forest System
lands. The remaining thirty-two acres is divided into sixteen acres for support facilities and sixteen acres for
old waste dumps. Disposal of mine wastes would be inside of the existing quarry area. Annual volume of stone removed
from the quarry would not exceed 2000 tons per year. Proposed project is for a total of ten years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original proposal by G. Antolini and Son resulted in the preparation of an environmental assessment for the proposed
action and four alternatives. The four alternatives included ``No Action'' and three alternatives that would allow
quarrying operations. The three operating alternatives vary in the amounts of Forest land that would be disturbed,
the different operating requirements and/or the lengths imposed on the total operating time. Based on agency scoping
and issues related to reclamation and the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act [SMARA] (California Public Resources
Code 2710 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it was determined that an environmental impact statement would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will require G. Antolini and Son to submit to the Resource Management Department, Santa Barbara County,
California, a Reclamation Plan as per SMARA. Any decision to approve the proposed Operating Plan would be in accordance
with Forest Service rules and regulations for the disposal of mineral materials as found at 36 CFR 228.40 through 228.67
and the regulations contained in SMARA. The County of Santa Barbara, California, as per the October 1992 Memorandum
of Understanding between the State of California, Department of Conservation and the State Mining and Geology Board,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, and the U.S. Department of the Interior,
Bureau of Land Management, California, will be accepting the final EIS as a functionally equivalent document to meet
their requirements under SMARA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to inform and to seek new information, comments and assistance during the original scoping period, the
Santa Lucia Ranger District, Los Padres National Forest, formally contacted ninety-two Federal, State, and local
agencies and other individuals and organizations who potentially were interested in or were affected by the proposed
action in December 1992. An additional twenty-four potentially interested individuals were formally contacted
in January 1993. A total of seven written responses were received by the Forest Service. This input was used to determine
the scope of the document and to validate the range of alternatives. The final phase of the public involvement process
will be the request for public comments on the draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary issues which have been identified are: visual viewshed, cultural and paleontological resource impacts,
slope stability, rehabilitation and reclamation of the mine and all of the associated area, impacts to water quality,
impacts to air quality, noise pollution, additional traffic and the need for road maintenance, impacts to the biological
resources, and socioeconomic effects.

The responsible official for the Forest Service and the NEPA process is Kathryn J. Silverman, District Ranger, Santa
Lucia Ranger District, 1616 Carlotti Drive, Santa Maria, California, 93454.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to be made by the District Ranger is whether or not to approve the proposed 10-Year Plan of Operations for
the Colson Quarry, as submitted by G. Antolini and Son, or to select another alternative for management of the current
quarry and the associated National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated date for completion of the DEIS is February 22, 1994. The estimated date for completion of the final EIS
is April 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the Federal Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is importation to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts the agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the environmental
impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The USDA Forest Service is proposing to construct 18.8 miles of road and harvest about 17.5 million board feet of timber
from 1,847 acres of suitable timber lands within the Millwood timber sale area. A mix of silvicultural treatments
is proposed, including 209 acres of commercial thinning, 467 acres of shelterwood (about 35 percent crown canopy
closure), 351 acres of irregular shelterwood (50&hyph;60 percent crown canopy closure), 452 acres of reserve tree
(about 5 trees per acre), 306 acres of sanitation/salvage, and 62 acres of strata 21 rehabilitation. This mix of silvicultural
prescriptions seeks to retain suitable habitat for sensitive species within all treatment units where it currently
exists, improve forest health (resilience and resistance to insect and disease), and increase dominance of seral
ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Helicopter logging is proposed for 150 acres (8 percent of the treatment acreage). Skyline logging is proposed for
894 acres (48 percent of the treatment acreage). Tractor logging is proposed for 803 acres (44 percent of the treatment
acreage). The proposed mix of logging systems seeks to protect leave stands and regenerate stands in a cost efficient
and cost effective manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This sale lies within the Council Mountain Roadless Area, Adams County, Idaho. Mill Creek and Cottonwood Creek are
the two drainages within the proposed timber sale area; both are tributaries of the Weiser River.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal follows direction in the Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, 1988 (Forest Plan).
The decision to be made is whether the sale area should be entered at this time for timber harvest and associated activities,
and, if so, the specific conditions of entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary issues include the proposal's effect on roadless characteristics, vegetation, water quality, biological
diversity, fisheries, soils, wildlife habitat, and economics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary alternatives being considered include no action, one that seeks to achieve Forest Plan objectives to
maximize timber growth and yield, and the proposed action alternative that modifies timber management intensity
in response to the preliminary issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) considering the proposed action and a reasonable range of alternatives
will be prepared. The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and to be available for
public review by March 1995. The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The USDA Forest Service is proposing to construct 10.0 miles of road and harvest about 14.9 million board feet of timber
from 1,145 acres of suitable timber lands within the Crystal Creek timber sale area. A mix of silvicultural treatments
is proposed, including 8 acres of commercial thinning, 101 acres of shelterwood (about 35 percent crown canopy closure),
643 acres of reserve tree (about 5 trees per acre), and 393 acres of sanitation/salvage. This mix of silvicultural
prescriptions seeks to retain suitable habitat for sensitive species within all treatment units where it currently
exists, improve forest health (resilience and resistance to insect and disease), and increase dominance of seral
ponderosa pine and douglas-fir.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Helicopter logging is proposed for 354 acres (31 percent of the treatment acreage). Skyline logging is proposed for
322 acres (28 percent of the treatment acreage). Tractor logging is proposed for 469 acres (41 percent of the treatment
acreage). The proposed mix of logging systems seeks to protect leave stands and regenerate stands in a cost efficient
and cost effective manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This sale lies within the council Mountain Roadless Area, Adams County, Idaho. Crystal Creek and Lake Creek are the
two drainages within the proposed timber sale area; both are tributaries of the Middle Fork Weiser River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal follows direction in the Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, 1988 (Forest Plan).
The decision to be made is whether the sale area should be entered at this time for timber harvest and associated activities,
and, if so, the specific conditions of entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary issues include the proposal's effect on roadless characteristics, vegetation, water quality, biological
diversity, fisheries, soils, wildlife habitat, and economics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary alternatives being considered include no action, an alternative that seeks to achieve forest Plan objectives
to maximize timber growth and yield, and the proposed action alternative that modifies timber management intensity
in response to the preliminary issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) considering the proposed action and a reasonable range of alternatives
will be prepared. The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and to be available for
public review by March 1995. The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers early notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of that proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewers position and contentions.

that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final environmental impact statement is scheduled to be completed by July 1995.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995 is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Dayton, Ohio geographic service area. The award number of this MBDC will be 05&hyph;10&hyph;94006&hyph;01.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered
programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will
then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the
demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose
of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal
awards may result in an applicant not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not
necessarily receive the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 156 of Title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 7, 1994, Procter &amp; Gamble Company, owner of record in the Patent and Trademark Office of U.S. Patent
No. 4,005,196, filed an application for interim extension of the term of this patent under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5). The
application states that the patent claims a composition of matter comprising the food additive product olestra.
The application indicates that the product is currently undergoing a regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration
for permission to market or use the product commercially. The original term of the patent is set to expire on January
25, 1994. Applicant requests an interim extension of the term of the patent for a period of one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156. Since it is apparent that the regulatory
review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the patent term
under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) of the term
of U.S. Patent No. 4,005,196 has been granted for a period of one year from the original expiration date of the patent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Eureka County Board of Commissioners has applied to lease an existing airstrip which serves the unincorporated
Town of Crescent Valley, Nevada, and surrounding vicinity. The lands were previously leased for airport purposes
by a succession of private individuals; however, the lease was allowed to expire the Eureka County has now applied
to lease the airstrip. The land is not required for any Federal purpose. Issuance of the lease would be consistent with
the Bureau's planning for the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The described lands were previously segregated from mineral entry by virtue of the previous lease, but were never
opened to entry upon expiration of the lease. Accordingly, this notice continues to segregate the lands from all forms
of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. Upon termination of the lease, the segregative
effect would terminate as specified in an opening order published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The lease when issued, will be subject to the provisions of the Act of May 24, 1928, and applicable regulations (43 CFR
2911) of the Secretary of the Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On or before March 10, 1994 interested parties may submit comments to the District Manager, Elko District Office,

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has prepared an Environmental Assessment for issuance of a section 10(a)(1)(B)
permit for the incidental take of the Federally endangered golden-cheeked warbler (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Dendroica chrysoparia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) during construction and operation of a 496 acre mixed residential and commercial development known as Lake Pointe
in Austin, Travis County, Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act to authorize
the incidental take of the golden-cheeked warbler.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant plans to build 850 single-family residences, a 10-acre commercial site, an elementary school, and
associated streets and utility corridors in southwest Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately
354 acres with the remaining 142 acres for open space, conducting golden-cheeked warbler monitoring studies, providing
$90,000 to fund the acquisition of golden-cheeked warbler habitat preserves, and constructing and maintaining
a fence between the proposed development and the areas of open space set aside for the golden-cheeked warbler. Details
of the mitigation are provided in the Lake Pointe Habitat Conservation Plan. Guarantees for implementation are provided
in the Agreement and the Management Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conservation plan actions ensure that the criteria established for issuance of an incidental take permit will
be fully satisfied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. No action,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Proposed action,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Alternate project location,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Reduce the proposed project, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Wait for the completion of the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan Section 10(a) permit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon information contained in the Environmental Assessment and the Habitat Conservation Plan, the Service
has determined that this action is not a major Federal action which would significantly affect the quality of the human
environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Accordingly,
the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed action is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is my decision to approve the issuance of the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit for the construction of the 496 acre mixed
residential/commercial development known as Lake Pointe Development in Austin, Travis County, Texas.

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of any endangered species, including the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered
species are at 50 CFR 17.22.

The Applicant plans to build a residential development on a 213 acre tract on RR2222 at Far West Blvd., west of Austin,
Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 86.84 acres including 10.58 acres of impervious
cover (i.e., streets, rooftops and driveways) with the remaining 126.16 acres proposed as conservation areas. These
activities will permanently eliminate about 86.84 acres of occupied and/or potential endangered species habitat.
The applicant proposed to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating 126.16 acres for open space, and providing
sufficient money to purchase land containing six golden-cheeked warbler territories adjacent to, or within, a preserve
that is managed for the warbler, and money, or other compensation, to operate and manage those lands for the life of
the permit.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FGDC is sponsoring a public review of the United States National Cartographic Standards for Spatial Accuracy.
The standard specifies the means of calculating horizontal and vertical accuracy for map graphics, the method by
which accuracy will be tested, the label to be applied to products that have been tested, and the application of the
standard to map series.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FGDC anticipates that the final standard will be submitted to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for the replacement
of the National Map Accuracy Standards, the last revision of which was issued by the former Bureau of the Budget in 1947.

The A&amp;G Railroad, L.L.C. (A&amp;G) has filed a notice of exemption to acquire from Abbeville &amp; Grimes Railway
Company (Abbeville) and to operate approximately 27 rail miles in Alabama, between Abbeville and Grimes, together
with incidental trackage rights over 7 miles of CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) lines between Grimes and Dothan,
AL, and substantially all of the other railroad operating assets of Abbeville. The proposed transaction is expected
to be consummated promptly upon the effectiveness of the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A&amp;G is 100% owned and controlled by Rail Partners, L.P. (Partners), a Delaware limited partnership, and Panama
City Beach Office Park, Ltd. (Office Park), a Florida limited partnership (collectively, Owners). Neither Partners
nor Office Park is a carrier, and Office Park does not currently control a carrier. However, Partners is jointly owned
and controlled by Mr. K. Earl Durden (Durden), Green Bay Packaging, Inc. (GBP), and Rail Management and Consulting
Corporation (RMCC), and with them jointly owns and controls several class III rail carriers. Office Park is jointly
owned and controlled by Partners and RMCC, and is thus under common control with those class III carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the class III carriers currently affiliated with Owners connects with A&amp;G. However, Durden, GBP, Partners,

Because A&amp;G and Bay Line connect by means of incidental trackage rights over CSXT, between Grimes and Dothan,
the ownership of A&amp;G will be placed in an independent voting trust prior to closing to prevent Durden, RMCC, GBP,

 Also contemporaneous with this filing, the A&amp;G Railroad, L.L.C. (A&amp;G), another newly formed Alabama limited
liability company, also owned by Partners and Office Park, is filing a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32437,
The A&amp;G Railroad, L.L.C._Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Rail Lines of Abbeville &amp; Grimes Railway
Company, to acquire from Abbeville &amp; Grimes Railway Company (Abbeville) and to operate approximately 27 rail
miles in Alabama, between Abbeville and Grimes, together with incidental trackage rights over 7 miles of CSX Transportation,
Inc. (CSXT) lines between Grimes and Dothan, AL, and substantially all of the other railroad operating assets of Abbeville.
Bay Line states that because, as a carrier, it will connect with A&amp;G by means of incidental trackage rights over
CSXT, between Grimes and Dothan, the ownership of A&amp;G will be placed in an independent voting trust prior to closing
to prevent Durden, RMCC, GBP, Partners, and Office Park from retaining direct control over A&amp;G once A&amp;G becomes
a carrier. Bay Line indicates that after the closing, a separate petition for exemption, or other pleading, will be
filed with the Commission, seeking appropriate authority or exemption for Owners to dissolve the voting trust and
acquire direct control over A&amp;G.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 14, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
establishing or changing a fee under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the
Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD is proposing a rule change to amend Schedule A to the By-Laws to adjust the amount of credit as set forth in Section
1(d) of Schedule A, which is currently 67%, to 59%, and to amend the calendar year dates from 1993 to 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Article VI of the By-Laws of the Corporation, the NASD requires its members to pay an annual assessment
fee based on gross income as defined by Schedule A, Section 1 to the By-Laws.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD also allows a credit against such assessment pursuant to Section 1(d). The NASD calculates the gross income
assessment from the gross income reported for the calendar or fiscal year preceding the NASD's calendar budget year.
Based on the operating budget for 1994, and subject to revision based on final actual gross income reports for 1993,
the NASD is proposing to amend the credit to adjust member assessments to reflect the estimated revenue needed to fund
1994 operations. This proposed rule change, therefore, amends the amount of credit set forth in Section 1(d) of Schedule
A to the By-Laws, which is currently 67%, to 59%, and applies the credit to the entire 1994 calendar budget year, and
amends the calendar year dates from 1993 to 1994.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Security Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Colorado and is the depositor of the Account.
The Account was organized under Colorado law, and is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust. That portion
of the assets of the Account that is equal to the reserves and other Contract liabilities with respect to the Account
is not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of Security Life. Any income, gains, or losses,
realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Account are credited to or charged against the Account without
regard to other income, gains, or losses of Security Life. The Account is divided into six divisions, each of which
invests exclusively in shares of The Palladian Trust (the ``Trust''). The Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end
management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SLD Equities, a registered broker-dealer and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Security Life, will be the principal
underwriter of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Contracts provide for retirement payments or other long-term benefits for persons covered under plans that
receive favorable federal income tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for persons desiring such
benefits who do not qualify for such tax advantages. The minimum initial purchase payment is $25,000 for a non-qualified
Contract and $1,500 for a qualified Contract. The minimum additional purchase payment is $500 for a non-qualified
Contract and $250 for a qualified Contract. Annuity payments under a Contract may be received on a variable basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The administrative charges to be assessed under the Contracts will be (a) an administrative charge of $30 per Contract
year, during the accumulation period only, if total purchase payments in the first Contract year are less than $100,000
and (b) a daily asset-based charge, at an annual effective rate of 0.15%, during both the accumulation and annuity
periods. Security Life guarantees that it will not raise these administrative charges for the duration of the Contracts.
Security Life also represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the administrative charges will
be greater than the total expected cost of administering the Contracts, on average, excluding costs that properly
are categorized as distribution expenses, over the period that the Contracts are in force.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If more than one demand partial withdrawal occurs during a Contract year, there will be a charge of the lesser of $25
of 2% of the amount withdrawn for each additional demand partial withdrawal. Security Life represents that it does
not expect that the total revenues from the partial withdrawal transaction charge will be greater than the total expected
cost of administering demand partial withdrawals, on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Contracts will permit transfers among the divisions of the Account, subject to certain conditions. Prior to
the annuity date, an Owner will be able to make up to 12 transfers each Contract year at no charge. Each additional transfer
will be subject to a charge of $25. After the annuity date, an Owner will be able to make no more than four transfers each
Contract year. No charge will be assessed for a transfer after the annuity date. Security Life represents that it does
not expect that the total revenues from the excess transfer charges will be greater than the total expected cost of
administering excess transfers, on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force. Security Life represents
that the amount that it will recover for premium taxes will not be greater than the amount of premium taxes required
to be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. No front-end sales charge will be imposed when purchase payments are applied under the Contracts. However, a surrender
charge will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts are taken
during the six year period from the date Security Life receives and accepts each purchase payment. The surrender charge
in the first Contract year is 7%, and reduces by 1% each Contract year thereafter; there is no surrender charge applicable
to the withdrawal of payments that are six or more years old. In no event is the surrender charge greater than the amount
withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants seek to impose a daily asset-based charge equal to 1.55% annually to compensate Security Life for certain
mortality and expense risks it bears under the Contracts. Security Life will assume several mortality risks under
the Contracts. First, Security Life assumes a mortality risk arising from the fact that the Contract does not impose
any surrender charge on the death benefit. Second, Security Life assumes an additional mortality risk by its contractual
obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the Annuitant under annuity options involving
life contingencies. Third, Security Life will assume a mortality risk because of its promise to pay a death benefit
to the beneficiary if the Owner dies prior to the annuity date. This assures each Annuitant that neither the Annuitant's
own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the annuity payments
received under a Contract. At the same time, Security Life assumes the risk that Annuitants as a group will live longer
than Security Life's annuity tables had predicted, which would require Security Life to pay out more in annuity income
than planned. The contracts contain annuity tables that are based on the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality Table
and, for variable annuity options, alternative net investment factors of 3% or 5%. Security Life guarantees these
annuity tables for the duration of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In general, the Contracts provide for a death benefit that is the greatest of: (a) The purchase payments made (less
partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken), accumulated at 7% per
year (the interest rate for any Owner of attained age 75 or greater is 0%) up to a maximum of two times the sum of all purchase
payments (less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken); (b) the
accumulation value at the time of death; and (c) the step-up benefit plus purchase payments made, less partial withdrawals
and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken since the last step-up anniversary. The step-up
benefit at issue is the initial purchase payment. At each step-up anniversary, the current accumulation value is
compared to the prior determination of the step-up benefit, increased by purchase payments made and reduced by partial
withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken since that anniversary. The greater
of these becomes the new step-up benefit. The step-up anniversaries are the Contract date and every sixth Contract
anniversary thereafter (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sixth, twelfth, eighteenth, etc. Contract anniversaries). The death benefit equal to the accumulation value, or
to the sum of the purchase payments made less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction
charges taken, constitutes the basic death benefit. The death benefit in excess of the foregoing basic death benefit,
including purchase payments accumulated at 7% interest as described above, and the step-up benefits as described
above, constitutes the enhanced death benefit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. In addition to mortality risks, Security Life will assume an expense risk under the Contracts. This risk arises
because the administrative charges under outstanding Contracts, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to
cover actual administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. As compensation for assuming these mortality and expense risks, Security Life proposes to assess against the
Account a daily charge at an annual aggregate rate of 1.55%. Approximately 1.20% of this annual charge is allocated
to the mortality risks that Security Life will assume, and 0.35% is allocated to the expense risks that Security Life
will assume. Of the 1.20% charge allocated to the mortality risk, 0.90% is for the cost of the basic death benefit and
the other mortality risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts, and 0.30% is for the cost of the enhanced death
benefit. Security Life will assess the charge for mortality and expense risks during the accumulation period and
annuity period, except that Security Life will not assess the 0.30% charge for the enhanced death benefit during the
annuity period. Security Life guarantees that it will not raise the charge for the duration of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. If the administrative charges and the mortality and expense risk charge are insufficient to cover the expenses
and costs assumed, the loss will be borne by Security Life. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient,
the excess will be profit to Security Life. Security Life represents that it likely will earn a profit from the mortality
and expense risk charge. To the extent that the surrender charge is insufficient to cover the actual costs of distribution,
the expenses will be paid from Security Life's general account assets, which will include profit, if any, derived
from the mortality and expenses risk charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Applicants request that the order also permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets
of any other separate account established by Security Life in the future to support deferred variable annuity contracts,
which contracts are offered on a basis that is similar in all material respects to the basis on which the Contracts are
offered.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Applicants submit
that their request for an order that applies to the Account and to future separate accounts issuing contracts that
are substantially similar to the Contracts is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness
in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for Security Life to file redundant exemptive applications,
thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. The delay and expense
involved in having to repeatedly seek exemptive relief would impair Security Life's ability to effectively take
advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent
with the purposes of the Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If Security Life were required to
repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this Application, investors would
not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions
are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter
thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a
trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the Act and are held under an agreement
that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants'
proposed mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% (which includes the basic mortality
risk charge of 0.90% and the expense risk charge of 0.35%), or 1.55% (which includes the foregoing charge of 1.25% and
the enhanced mortality risk charge of 0.30%), is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Security Life under
the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products.
Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly available information about
similar industry practices, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels and benefits provided,
the existence of expense charge guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. Security Life undertakes to maintain
at its home office, and make available to the Commission or its staff upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail
the methodology used in making the foregoing determinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Applicants assert that the mortality risk charge of 0.30% for the enhanced death benefit is reasonable in relation
to the risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts. In arriving at this determination, Security Life conducted
a large number of trials at different issue ages to determine the expected cost of the enhanced death benefit. First,
hypothetical asset returns were projected using generally accepted actuarial simulation methods. For each asset
return pattern generated, hypothetical accumulated values were calculated by applying the projected asset returns
to the initial value in a hypothetical account. Each accumulated value so calculated was then compared to the amount
of the enhanced death benefit payable in the event of the hypothetical Owner's death during the year in question. By
analyzing the results of a statistically valid number of such simulations, Security Life was able to determine actuarially
the level cost of providing the enhanced death benefit. Based on this analysis, Security Life determined that the
mortality risk charge of 0.30% was a reasonable charge for providing the enhanced death benefit. Security Life undertakes
to maintain at its home office a memorandum, available to the Commission and its staff upon request, setting forth
in detail the methodology used in determining that the risk charge of 0.30% for the enhanced death benefit is reasonable
in relation to the risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The surrender charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In that
event, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset
by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the surrender charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Security Life
has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will
benefit the Account and its Owners. Security Life undertakes to maintain at its home office, and make available upon
request to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting out the basis for such conclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Security Life also represents that the Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes,
in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated
and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Act.

interests in the same portfolio, and (b) to assess a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on redemptions of
shares of some of the classes, and to waive the CDSC in certain cases.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each of the Funds is a series, and separate diversified portfolio of, the Trust, a registered open-end management
investment company. The Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The Adviser, a majority-owned subsidiary
of NWNL Companies, Inc., is a registered investment adviser that will provide investment advisory services to each
of the Funds. The Distributor is a registered broker-dealer that will act as principal underwriter of the Funds' shares,
and is an affiliated person of the Adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants propose to establish a multiple class distribution system (the ``Multi-Class Distribution System'')
to enable each of the Funds to offer an unlimited number of classes of shares that would be subject to a front-end sales
load, a CDSC, a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for a distribution fee and service fee, a combination of the above, or
none of the above. Classes of shares that do not have a front-end sales load, and are subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan
and a CDSC are referred to herein as ``Deferred Option'' classes. Applicants will comply with Article III, Section
26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice, which limits the amount of asset-based distribution charges a Fund may assess.
All Fund expenditures for distribution will be made in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Each Fund currently intends to offer only two classes of shares (``Class A'' and ``Class B''). Some or all of the Funds
may not in fact create or issue additional classes of shares. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Funds will offer Class A shares at net asset value plus a front-end sales load. The front-end sales loads generally
would be subject to reductions for larger purchases and under a right of accumulation. Class A shares also will be subject
to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for distribution and service fees at a combined annual rate of up to .30 percent
of the average daily net asset value of that class. In addition, Class A shareholders who purchase shares at net asset
value without the imposition of a front-end sales load may be subject to a low level CDSC (not to exceed 2 percent of net
asset value) for a specified period, not to exceed two years, from the date of purchase when they redeem their Class
A shares. The purpose of such a sales charge is to reimburse the Distributor for commissions paid to dealers at the time
of sale from the Distributor's own resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Funds will offer Class B shares at net asset value subject to a CDSC, as described below. Class B shares also will
be subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for combined distribution and service fees at an annual rate of up to
1 percent of the average daily net asset value of that class.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Investment income and unrealized and realized gains or losses will be allocated daily to each class of shares based
on the percentage of net assets of the outstanding or dividend eligible shares, as appropriate, in each class of a Fund
at the beginning of each day. Operating expenses, which are attributable to all classes, will be allocated daily to
each class of shares based on the percentage of the Fund's net assets in each class at the beginning of the day. Expenses
that have a greater cost for one class than another (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, rule 12b&hyph;1 fees and possibly transfer agent fees) will be charged separately to each class. Because of higher
ongoing distribution fees and potentially higher transfer agency fees paid by holders of the Deferred Option shares,
the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Deferred Option shares would be lower than the net income
attributable to and the dividends payable on Class A shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Class B shares may convert automatically to Class A shares after a specified period of years. In addition, for the
purposes of conversion, shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in
respect of Class B shares are also Class B shares, except that they will be considered held in a separate sub-account.
Each time a shareholder's Class B shares, other than those in the sub-account, convert to Class A, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of the Class B shares in the sub-account also will convert to Class A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants reserve the ability to convert shares of any class to shares of another, consistent with the standards,
policies, conditions, and representations set forth in the application regarding the conversion of Class B shares
to Class A shares. Such ability to convert shares will be subject to the terms fully disclosed in a Fund's registration
statement current at the time of sale, and will be at the relative net asset values of each of the classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The conversion feature is subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service private
letter ruling to the effect that such conversion of shares does not constitute a taxable event under federal income
tax law, and may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants anticipate that each class of shares may be exchanged for shares of the same class in another Fund to
the extent that the shareholder would have been eligible to purchase the shares acquired in the exchange. The exchange
privileges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants expect that the CDSC applicable to Class B shares will vary from 2 percent to 5 percent for redemptions
made during the first year after purchase to 1 percent for redemptions made during the fourth year after purchase.
The CDSC applicable to Class B shares will not be imposed on redemptions of shares purchased more than six years prior
to their redemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the
net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption. The CDSC of any particular Fund or class
thereof may be higher or lower than that described in the application. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares derived
from the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount
which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above
the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares
representing capital appreciation, next of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions,
and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if
any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Applicants propose to waive the CDSC, in whole or in part, in connection with (a) redemptions made within one year
following the death or disability, as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b)(i) a lump sum or other distribution following retirement, or, in the case of
an individual retirement account (``IRA''), Keogh Plan, or custodial account pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the
Code, after the shareholder has attained age 591/2, or any redemption resulting from a tax-free return of an excess
contribution pursuant to section 408(d) (4) or (5) of the Code, or from the death or disability of the employee, or (ii)
in the alternative, in connection with a distribution following retirement under a tax-deferred retirement plan,
or attaining age 701/2 in the case of an IRA, Keogh Plan, or custodial account pursuant to section 403(b) of the Code,
or resulting from the tax-free return of an excess contribution to an IRA; (c) redemptions of shares purchased by active
or retired officers, directors or trustees, partners and employees of the Funds, the Distributor or affiliated companies,
by members of the immediate families of such persons, by dealers having a sales agreement with the Distributor, by
any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality, department, authority, or agency thereof and by trust companies
and bank trust departments which hold shares in a fiduciary capacity; (d) redemptions of shares made pursuant to a
shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (e) redemptions by shareholders
holding shares of a Fund worth over $1 million immediately prior to redemption; (f) redemptions effected by advisory
accounts managed by the Adviser; (g) redemptions by tax-exempt employee benefit plans resulting from the adoption
or promulgation of any law or regulation; and (h) redemptions effected by registered investment companies in connection
with the combination of an investment company with a Fund by merger, acquisition of assets, or by any other transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. If the Funds waive or reduce the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be applied uniformly to all offerees in the specified
class. If the Trustees of a Fund determine to discontinue the waiver or reduction of the CDSC, the disclosure in the
Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any shares purchased prior to the termination or reduction of such
waiver will be able to have the CDSC waived or reduced as provided in the Fund's prospectus at the time of the purchase
of such shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The Funds may provide a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 credit, to be paid for by the Distributor, for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment
effected within 365 days, or a shorter period, of the redemption.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed Multi-Class Distribution System might be
deemed: (a) to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g), and thus prohibited
by section 18(f)(1), and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i). Applicants also seek an exemption
from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d), and rule 22c&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit the imposition
and waiver of a CDSC on redemptions of Fund shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants believe that the proposal will permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities
and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting
and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. Applicants assert that, under the proposed Multi-Class
Distribution System, the Funds will save the organizational and other continuing costs that would be incurred if
the Funds were required to establish new separate investment portfolios.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants believe that the Multi-Class Distribution System does not raise any of the concerns that prompted the
SEC to recommend the adoption of section 18, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 excessive borrowing, inadequate assets or reserves, and increased speculative character of junior securities.
Applicants state that the proposal does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves.
In addition, applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares
of the Funds, since all such shares will participate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in all of a Fund's appreciation, income and expenses, with the exception of the different distribution fees and any
different transfer agency costs payable by each class. Applicants contend that mutuality of risk will be preserved
with respect to each class of shares in a Fund.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Applicants assert that the proposed capital structures of the Funds will not induce any group of shareholders to
invest in risky securities to the detriment of any other group of shareholders because the investment risks of each
Fund will be borne equally by all of its shareholders. Moreover, applicants further assert that the proposed capital
structures will not enable insiders to manipulate the expenses and profits among the various classes of shares because
the Funds are not organized in a pyramid fashion, all expenses and profits of a Fund, other than the different class
expenses, will be borne 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by all shares of the Fund, and all shareholders will have equal voting rights, except concerning matters relating
to each class' rule 12b&hyph;1 plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely
to: (a) The impact of the respective rule 12b&hyph;1 plan payments made by each of the classes of shares of a Fund, any
higher incremental transfer agency costs attributable solely to the Deferred Option shares of a Fund, and any other
incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved
by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule
12b&hyph;1 distribution plan, except as provided in condition 4 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of
each class of shares; (d) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature; and (e) the designation
of each class of shares of a Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Trustees of each of the Funds, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall have approved the Multi-Class
Distribution System, prior to the implementation of the Multi-Class Distribution System by a particular Fund. The
minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect
to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class Distribution System will reflect in detail the reasons for
determining that the proposed Multi-Class Distribution System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their
respective shareholders and such minutes will be available for inspection by the SEC staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between or among the interests of the classes of
shares offered. The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for
reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor

4. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares (the ``Target Class'') under the plan, existing shares of a class of shares that converts
into the Target Class shares after a period of time (the ``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into the Target Class
unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take
such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class
of shares (the ``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to
implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into the Target Class.
If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing
Purchase Class shares for a new class (the ``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in
all material respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class
or the New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this
condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation.
In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the
New Target Class or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. The Purchase Class
shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into the Target Class shares subject to the higher
maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to
the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

5. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to
that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the Independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
rule 12b&hyph;1 plans relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and any incremental
transfer agency costs relating a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by such class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of income and expenses between the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent
Examiner'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such
methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate
manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will
monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render
at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports
of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a)
and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to such reports, following request
by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request
for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission,
limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant
Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the
Independent Examiner is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will
be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and
described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be
adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses between such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent Examiner
in the initial report referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner, or an
appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred
to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective action if this representation is not concurred
in by the Independent Examiner, or appropriate substitute Independent Examiner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling or servicing
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.

11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
of the Funds with respect to the Multi-Class Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the Trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, service, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the expenses
and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will
contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund
as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to the classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the expenses and/or performance
data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper
or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present each class of shares separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval,
authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1
plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The conversion of one class of shares to another class of shares will be done on the basis of the relative net asset
value of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted
shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III,
Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales
charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.
