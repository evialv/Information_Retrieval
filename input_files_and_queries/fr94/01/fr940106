SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the Federal Seed Act regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and
red clover grown in Mexico and imported into the United States. The removal of the requirements is necessary to make
the regulations conform to the amendment of the Federal Seed Act by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act. The effect of this action is to relieve a restriction on importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are amending the Federal Seed Act Regulations in 7 CFR part 201 (referred to below as the regulations) by removing
the requirement that 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of each container of alfalfa or red clover grown in Mexico be stained red. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective
January 1, 1994. To implement this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments included in the Act become effective coincident with
NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment in this final rule is mandated by section 361(a) of the Act, which amended section 302(e)(1) of the Federal
Seed Act (7 U.S.C. 1582(e)(1)) by providing that the provisions requiring certain seeds to be stained red shall not
apply to alfalfa or red clover seed originating in Mexico. (See Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is being taken to conform the regulations with the amendments to the Act, by amending &sect;201.104
of the regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and red clover grown in Mexico and
imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that good cause exists to publish this final rule without prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice and opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain regulatory actions must be taken as a result of the statutory amendments discussed in the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Background
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' and must become effective with NAFTA to avoid inconsistency between the regulations and their statutory authority.
Removal of the origin staining requirement for alfalfa and red clover seed imported from Mexico is one of the regulatory
changes that must become effective at the same time as NAFTA and the Act to avoid this conflict. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action relieves a restriction on the importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico. Since prior notice
and other public procedures with respect to this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since this regulatory change is mandated by Congress, there is good cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 5 U.S.C. 553 for making this final rule effective as of January 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act, as amended, removes the requirement that alfalfa and red clover seed that is imported from Mexico be stained
red. This final rule conforms the regulations to the Act. We have no record of any alfalfa or red clover having been imported
from Mexico in the past 5 years, and we anticipate no importations in the foreseeable future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The regulations in 7 CFR part 322 (referred to below as the regulations) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
govern the importation into the United States of honeybees and honeybee semen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations were established pursuant to the Honeybee Act (7 U.S.C. 281 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
et seq.) The Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;United States of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 322.1 of the regulations contains a footnote that includes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria set forth in the Honeybee Act for determining which countries may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in the regulations as countries from which honeybees or honeybee semen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be imported into the United States. In this rule, we are amending that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
footnote to reflect amendments to the Honeybee Act made by section 361(d)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 361(d)(2) of the Act amended subsections (a) and (b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honeybee Act by providing the following: (1) That honeybees may be imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms as the Secretary of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subspecies of honeybees; and (2) that honeybee semen may be imported from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. (See Pub. L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103&hyph;182; 107 Stat. 2057). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends a footnote in the regulations that quotes the Act, in order to conform the footnote to the Act, as amended
by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the regulations will have no practical impact on importations of honeybees and honeybee semen from
Canada or Mexico since it merely quotes the Act. Furthermore, such importations are already allowed from any part
of Canada. Currently, the only regular movement of honeybees from Canada to the United States is a relatively insignificant
movement from the Maritime Provinces of Canada to northern New England. We anticipate that the amendments will have
little practical impact with regard to importations from Mexico. Sufficient numbers of honeybees are already available
in the United States to make it unnecessary to import honeybees or honeybee semen from Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The criteria for determining which countries may be listed in this part as countries from which honeybees or honeybee
semen may be imported into the United States are set forth in 7 U.S.C. 282. In this regard, 7 U.S.C. provides in relevant

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In order to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees, and the introduction
of genetically undesirable germ plasm of honeybees, the importation into the United States of all honeybees is prohibited,
except that honeybees may be imported into the United States_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From countries determined by the Secretary of Agriculture_

(A) To be free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To have in operation precautions adequate to prevent the importation of honeybees from other countries where
harmful diseases or parasites, or undesirable species or subspecies, of honeybees exist; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) From Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture determines appropriate,
if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely
to remain, free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Honeybee semen may be imported into the United States only from:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1991, REA published a final rule on part 1773, at 56 FR 63354, concerning audits of REA borrowers. Part
1773 implements the standard REA security instrument provision requiring REA borrowers to prepare and furnish to
REA, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations,
and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to REA, audited and certified by an independent CPA, satisfactory
to REA, and accompanied by a report of such audit, in form and substance satisfactory to REA. A report of the audit was
defined in &sect;1773.1 to include the auditor's report, report on compliance, report on internal controls and management
letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The management letter is prepared by the CPA and addresses specific internal control, compliance, and other program
issues not typically addressed in the standard auditor's report, report on internal controls, or report on compliance.
The requirements for preparing a management letter are set forth in &sect;1773.34, Management Letter. This final
rule revises and clarifies &sect;1773.34(e). Section 1773.34 (e)(1)(i) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34
(e)(2)(i) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to test compliance with the loan and security instrument provision
requiring borrowers to maintain insurance. REA is currently reviewing its insurance requirements to determine
if these requirements are representative of current industry standards. Therefore, until such time as REA's review
is completed and revisions, if any, to current policies are finalized, CPAs will not be required to test for compliance
with the mortgage provision relating to insurance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1773.34(e)(1)(ii) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(iii) for telephone borrowers requires
CPAs to test for compliance with the loan and security instrument provision requiring funds to be deposited in banks
or other depositories designated in the loan documents or approved by REA. Because of the many and varied investing
activities available in today's economy, CPAs have questioned the definition of funds and what, if any, investments
are affected. This final rule provides a definition of funds for purposes of applying this part 1773.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iv) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(iv) for telephone borrowers requires
CPAs to review the financial and statistical report and state whether the information presented is in agreement with
the borrower's records. CPAs have questioned whether they are required to review a certified copy of the report obtained
directly from REA or whether they may review a copy represented by the borrower as having been submitted to REA. This
final rule clarifies REA's requirement for CPAs to review a copy of the financial and statistical report represented
by the borrower as having been submitted to REA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iii) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(ii) for telephone borrowers requires
the CPA to state whether an REA borrower has complied with the provision of its loan and security instrument that requires
a borrower to obtain written approval of mortgagees to enter into any contract for the operation or maintenance of
all or any part of its property, or for the use of its property by others. This requirement clearly goes beyond the scope
of government auditing standards because it requires all contracts, even those that have little or no impact on financial
statement amounts, to be reviewed by the CPA for REA approval. This testing has, during the effective period of part
1773, translated into increased audit fees. To minimize the cost impact to REA borrowers yet provide REA the assurance
it requires, this final rule details the contracts that must be reviewed by CPAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also incorporates the illustrative management letter, as amended by these part 1773 revisions, issued
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in a Technical Practice Aid dated November 11, 1992. The
illustrative letter properly addresses the management letter requirements set forth in 7 CFR 1773.34 and includes
specific language to ensure compliance with the promulgated auditing literature. As such, REA believes it is more
informative than the sample management letter previously provided in appendix C to part 1773.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to a procedural change within REA that will more efficiently process and review audit reports submitted by REA
borrowers, this final rule also amends &sect;1773.3, &sect;1773.20, and &sect;1773.21 to require borrowers to
submit to REA an additional copy of the audit, report on compliance, report on internal controls, and management letter
and revises &sect;1773.21 to require the submission of an additional copy of borrowers' plans for corrective action.

A proposed rule entitled Policy on Audits of REA Borrowers, published September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49442, invited interested
parties to submit comments on or before November 22, 1993. Comments were received from the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association (NRECA) and two certified public accounting firms. The comments submitted by NRECA were
based upon an analysis performed by the Accounting &amp; Depreciation Committee, a subcommittee of the Generation
and Transmission Managers Association Technical Advisory Committee, and were considered and concurred in by the
NRECA Accounting and Tax Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One accounting firm agreed with the proposed revisions in all respects. The other commenters agreed with the proposed
revisions; however, proffered additional revisions. The following paragraphs address the additional revisions

 Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 state that the certified public accountant's (CPA) workpapers must document whether
all regulatory assets and liabilities comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and have received REA approval. REA telephone borrowers
that comply with generally accepted accounting principles as required by part 32 of the Federal Communications Commission's
Rules and Regulations, Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies, are not required to obtain
specific REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities. Only REA electric borrowers must seek such approval.
Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 should be amended to specify that REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities
must only be documented for REA electric borrowers.

 Section 1773.9(c) states that pursuant to the terms of its audit agreement with the borrower, the CPA must immediately
report, in writing, all irregularities and all indications or instances of illegal acts, whether material or not
to: (1) The president of the borrower's board of directors; (2) the Director, Borrowers Accounting Division; and
(3) the Office of Inspector General. This requirement goes beyond that of generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS) which limits reporting requirements for irregularities to material instances and instances
that cumulatively could have a material effect on the financial statements. GAGAS further limits the reporting of
illegal acts to only the top official of the entity arranging for the audit. REA should modify the requirements set
forth in &sect;1773.9(c) to correspond with the GAGAS requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA recognizes that certain procedures set forth in part 1773 exceed the requirements of a GAGAS audit and REA has acknowledged
that fact in the rule. The Office of Inspector General, in Departmental Regulation No. 1700&hyph;1, Basic OIG Investigation/Audit
Organization and Procedures, sets forth certain requirements that all Federal agencies within USDA must impose
upon nonFederal auditors. One of these requirements is that all irregularities or illegal acts, regardless of materiality,
discovered by nonFederal auditors be reported to the Federal agency requiring the audit and to OIG for appropriate
action. For this reason, no revisions were made in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1773.6(a)(2) states that ``The borrower and CPA acknowledge that REA regulations provide that if the borrower
fails to have an audit performed and documented in compliance with GAGAS and this part, the borrower is in violation
of its security instrument with REA''. This language exceeds the applicable mortgage covenant and the following
language should be substituted: ``The borrower and CPA acknowledge that REA will consider the borrower to be in violation
of its security instrument with REA if the borrower fails to have an audit performed and documented in compliance with

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAGAS and 7 CFR part 1773. This acknowledgement shall not be considered a contractual admission against interest
by either the borrower or the CPA.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA's proposed rule published on September 23, 1993, did not include revisions to &sect;1773.6(a)(2). Therefore,
comments on this section went beyond the scope of the proposal. REA is planning a separate rulemaking procedures that
will include changes in &sect;1773.6(a)(2) and REA will be soliciting comments at that time.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain disclosure and reporting requirements contained in &sect;1773.34 should include some consideration of
materiality. The concept of materiality is inherent in all audits. Strict compliance with the existing policy has,
however, resulted in reporting of immaterial items of non-compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.  
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously discussed, REA recognizes that certain procedures set forth in part 1773 exceed the requirements of
a GAGAS audit and REA has acknowledged that fact in the rule. Section 1773.34 sets forth REA's requirement that the
CPA must prepare a management letter and establishes the testing and reporting requirements for the management letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1773.34(e) sets forth certain provisions of REA's security instrument that REA has determined are essential
to the security of its loans. CPAs auditing REA borrowers are, therefore, required to test for compliance with the
security instrument provisions set forth in &sect;1773.34. Because of the degree of reliance that REA places on the
CPAs' testing in these areas, REA has determined that materiality should not be a factor upon which testing is based.
REA has, however, through the publication of this final rule, revised and eliminated many of the unclear or burdensome
requirements set forth in part 1773. For this reason, no additional revisions were made to &sect;1773.34.

We have audited the financial statements of [

Name of Borrower
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
] for the year ended December 31, 19x5, and have issued our report thereon dated March 15, 19x6. We conducted our audit
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States, and 7 CFR part 1773, Policy on Audits of Rural Electrification Administration (REA)
Borrowers. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Name of Borrower
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
] for the year ended December 31, 19x5, we considered its internal control structure in order to determine our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the financial statements and not to provide assurance on the
internal control structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining the internal control structure
and the objectives of and inherent limitations in such a structure is set forth in our independent auditors' report
on the internal control structure dated March 15, 19x6, and should be read in conjunction with this report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our consideration of the internal control structure would not necessarily disclose all matters in the internal control
structure that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A material weakness is a condition in which the design or operation of the specific internal control structure elements
does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that errors or irregularities in amounts that would be material in
relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. However, we noted no matters involving the internal
control structure and its operation that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above. [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
If a material weakness was noted, refer the reader to the independent auditors' report on internal control structure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 1773.34 requires comments on specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance with specific
REA loan and security instrument provisions, and other additional matters. We have grouped our comments accordingly.
In addition to obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements,
at your request, we performed tests of specific aspects of the internal control structure, of compliance with specific
REA loan and security instrument provisions, and of additional matters. The specific aspects of the internal control
structure, compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, and additional matters tested
include, among other things, the accounting procedures and records, materials control, compliance with specific
REA loan and security instrument provisions set forth in 7 CFR 1773.34 (e)(1), [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
for telephone borrowers, 7 CFR 1773.34 (e)(2)], 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
related party transactions, and depreciation rates. [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For electric borrowers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
:] The additional matters tested also include a schedule of deferred debits and credits, upon which we express an opinion.
In addition, our audit of the financial statements also included the procedures specified in 7 CFR 1773.38&hyph;.45.
Our objective was not to provide an opinion on these specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance
with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, or additional matters, and accordingly, we express no
opinion thereon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No reports (other than our independent auditors' report, our independent auditors' compliance report, and our independent
auditors' report on the internal control structure, all dated March 15, 19x6) or summary of recommendations related
to our audit have been furnished to management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to reflect an administrative change in the procedure
for notifying licensees of changes in the user fee charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for processing
fingerprint cards as part of the criminal history checks that nuclear power reactor licensees are required to perform
for those individuals granted unescorted access to an operating nuclear power facility or access to Safeguards Information.
This notice also informs licensees of the new user fee adopted by the FBI effective January 3, 1994.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of 10 CFR 73.57 requires licensees to process fingerprint cards through the NRC to the FBI Criminal
Justice Information Services Division which then does a criminal history check. A user fee for processing fingerprint
cards was required by Congress (Pub. L. 99&hyph;399), is established by the FBI, and is periodically increased as
the FBI's processing costs change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1993, the FBI's Division of Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) notified the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission that the ``user fee'' charged by the FBI for processing fingerprint cards had been increased from $23.00
to $24.00 effective January 3, 1994. The FBI user fee includes a $2.00 handling cost for the agency doing the initial
screening of the fingerprint cards, and provides that the agency doing the initial screening retains that handling
cost. In the case of nuclear reactor licensees, the NRC performs this initial screening. The user fee is periodically
changed by the FBI, as their processing costs change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this amendment pertains only to a user-fee change imposed by the FBI, the Commission for good cause finds that
the notice and public procedure provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act are impractical and unnecessary.
Comment will not serve to alter the FBI fee, which is outside the control of the NRC. Further, rather than engaging in
an unnecessary rulemaking procedure to amend the rule every time the FBI changes the fee, this amendment removes the
fee amount from the rule. The Commission will advise licensees directly when the FBI fee changes. A notice of the FBI
fee change pertaining to NRC licensees will also be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.

Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described as a categorical exclusion in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under approval number 3150&hyph;0002.

Backfit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to the action taken in this final rulemaking
and, therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule because this amendment does not involve
any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

Airspace Docket 93&hyph;ASO&hyph;17, published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54953), changed the effective hours of
certain Class D Airspace areas from full time to part time. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport was inadvertently
included in the list of Class D Airspace areas in error. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport is Class E2 airspace,
an airspace area designated as a surface area for an airport. Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASO&hyph;18, published
on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54954), changed the effective hours of certain Class E airspace areas from full time to part
time. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport was inadvertently omitted from the list of Class E airspace areas. This
action corrects the errors by changing the designation of the Columbus Golden Triangle, MS Airspace area from Class
D to Class E.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is today issuing a final rule which amends the implementing
regulations for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). A number of the revisions are required by the American Technology
Preeminence Act of 1992, including provisions on: participation by foreign companies in ATP; the establishment
of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act; and a new requirement that
``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led. Further, requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP
recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under ATP have been repealed by the Act, and are thus
removed from the regulations. Similarly, ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations
has been repealed. Also, changes not required by the Act are made, including changes to simplify and clarify the selection
criteria, and to streamline the internal operations of ATP, including the selection process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology is today issuing a final rule which amends regulations found at
part 295 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which implement the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). The
Advanced Technology Program assists United States businesses to carry out high-risk research and development that
will, if successful, improve the competitive position of the United States and its businesses by accelerating the
development of technologies that have significant potential to stimulate economic growth, and raise productivity.
ATP enters into cooperative agreements with United States joint research and development ventures and United States
businesses, especially small businesses. Where appropriate, Federal laboratories may be involved in ATP projects
consistent with other authority, such as cooperative research and development agreements under section 12 of the
Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980.

Description of the Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to part 295 include revisions on the following topics (please see the analysis of comments below for additional
details):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The eligibility of foreign firms to participate in ATP is addressed in a new section 295.3 of the regulations,
and a related definition of ``United States owned company'' is added in section 295.2(r). These revisions follow
the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(9)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The establishment of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;517, as amended) is set out at section 295.8(a). These revisions follow the requirements of section
201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)). That statute requires that
title to inventions made in whole or part with Program funds reside with for-profit companies that have been incorporated
in the United States. Entities that are not for-profit organizations incorporated in this country are not eligible
to obtain title to inventions made under the Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led, set out at &sect;&sect;295.2(i)
and 295.21, and the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations, set
out at &sect;295.30. These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively,
of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under
ATP have been repealed, and are thus removed from existing &sect;295.7(c) of the regulations. This revision follows
the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Finally, changes not required by the Act are made to the selection criteria, and to the internal operations
of ATP, including the selection process. These changes particularly include revisions to the remaining definitions
in &sect;295.2, changes to the selection process described in &sect;&sect;295.4 and 295.5, changes to the selection
criteria as set out in &sect;295.6, and changes to program administration found in &sect;&sect;295.7 and 295.14.

Summary of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 2, 1993, the Technology Administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 41069). In response to this notice forty-four letters were received; twenty-nine from universities, ten from
other not-for-profit research organizations and industry associations, one from a state agency, one from a U.S.-owned
for-profit company, one from a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned corporation, one from a member of the U.S. House
of Representatives, and one from a member of the NIST staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All but four of the forty-four respondents, including all twenty-nine from universities and all ten from other not-for-profit
organizations, commented on the proposed revision to the treatment of patent rights found in &sect;295.8. An additional
two dozen comments were received concerning proposed changes to the proposed definitions set out in &sect;295.2.
The remaining comments were scattered among several sections, including: five concerning new &sect;295.14, which
deals with special financial reporting requirements; three on the revisions to the selection criteria found in &sect;295.5;
two on the use of abbreviated proposals proposed in &sect;295.5; and one each on the provisions on the eligibility
and qualification of applicants found in &sect;&sect;295.3 and 295.31. No comments were received in response to
proposed changes to the following: &sect;295.1, pertaining to the purpose of the regulation; &sect;295.4, the selection
process; &sect;295.7, pertaining to notices of availability of funds; &sect;295.21, on qualification of applicants;
&sect;295.22, dealing with limitations on assistance; &sect;295.24, concerning registration under the antitrust
laws; and &sect;295.30, which describes the types of assistance available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a section-by-section description of the comments received by NIST, and NIST's response to those
comments.

Section 295.2&blank;Definitions_Comment Summary (24 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-three respondents, all universities or other nonprofit organizations, questioned whether the definition
of ``United States-owned company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule reflected the actual intent of Congress
as stated in the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991. The definition of United States-owned company set out
in &sect;295.2(r) is used in section 295.8 to determine eligibility to obtain title to inventions arising from assistance
under ATP. A consolidated analysis of the issues raised by &sect;295.2(r) and 295.8 is presented in the discussion
of &sect;295.8 later in this notice, and the reader is asked to refer to that discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the issue described above, one respondent questioned the exclusion (by omission) of independent research
and development (IR&amp;D) costs in the definition of matching funds found in &sect;295.2(1). IR&amp;D funds are
generally generated through contracts funded by the federal government. The financial assistance regulations
which are applicable to ATP awards, and particularly Attachment E to OMB Circular A&hyph;110, prohibit the use of
federal funds as cost share or match unless specifically authorized by federal law. The rule follows closely the wording
of the 1988 legislation and hence cannot be changed without congressional action. The purpose of the limitations
on qualified matching funds is to obtain a meaningful and significant commitment of company resources towards ATP
objectives, including support to additional R&amp;D beyond that which would have occurred without the ATP award.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned company requested that both eligibility requirements and cancellation requirements
for foreign-owned applicants be made clearer and that they be consistent with present law and with H.R. 820. In response,
NIST notes that H.R. 820 is not law, but rather is pending legislation in the Congress. NIST cannot base changes in rules
upon proposed legislation that has not been enacted.

Section 295.5&blank;Use of Abbreviated Proposals in the Selection Process_(2 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents endorsed the use of abbreviated proposals. One respondent further proposed that abbreviated proposals
address, and thus be evaluated on, scientific and technical criteria only. NIST has determined that business and
economic factors are important factors in assessing the potential for success of a proposed project, and therefore
must be considered in addition to the scientific and technical merit of the proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents endorsed the increased emphasis on ``scientific and technical merit'', one of whom suggested increasing
its weight further to 40 percent. Another respondent took issue with the reduced weight for two proposers ``level
of commitment'' and suggested increasing the weight for the ``commitment'' criteria to 30 percent by eliminating
``experience and qualifications'' as a separate criteria.

In response to these comments, &sect;295.5 has been modified to increase the weight of the ``level of commitment''
to 20 percent, the level that exists in the regulation as it was promulgated in 1990. The weight given ``experience
and qualifications'' has been reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent.

Section 295.8(a)&blank;Patent Rights_(40 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty comments were received concerning the proposed revision to &sect;295.8(a)(1), thirty-nine from universities
and other nonprofit organizations opposed to the proposal, and one from a business supporting the proposal. Also,
twenty-three of the thirty-nine commentors described above objected to the definition of ``United States-owned
company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``United States-owned company'' defined in &sect;295.2(r) is used in &sect;295.8(a)(1) to determine who
is eligible to obtain title inventions arising from assistance under ATP. The definition states that an entity must
be organized for profit-making purposes to be deemed a United States-owned company, and &sect;295.8(a)(1) states
that only United States-owned companies may take title to inventions arising under the ATP. Taken together, the two
sections prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from obtaining title to inventions arising under
the ATP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The thirty-nine universities and nonprofit commentors are strongly opposed to this outcome. The following objection
is typical: ``The ATP legislation enables universities to participate in research funded through the program, and
(we have) taken advantage of the opportunity to do so. However, the problem is that NIST has interpreted the ATP legislation
to exclude universities from ownership of intellectual property resulting from ATP funded research.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the view of NIST, the decision to prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from taking title to inventions
is embedded in statute, and NIST has no alternative but to follow the law as it presently is written. As a result of comments
received from both for-profit and nonprofit organizations, NIST recognizes that one ingredient for the successful
implementation of joint ventures under ATP is a flexible patent policy. The participants in ATP joint ventures need
the flexibility to determine for themselves the best means of commercializing the technology they develop. This,
in turn, requires the flexibility to allocate intellectual property rights as the joint ventures best see fit. Accordingly,
NIST is working with the Congress in an attempt to enact a patent policy for ATP that leaves the decisions on patent ownership
to joint venture members. Should a change in the law be enacted, NIST would immediately implement it. In that case,
NIST would rely on the ATP proposal evaluation criteria to assess the probability of subsequent commercialization
based on the proposed intellectual property rights arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)) states that intellectual
property rights developed under ATP ``shall vest in a company or companies incorporated in the United States.'' In
reaching the conclusion that the term ``company or companies'' refers to profit-making entities, NIST has been guided
by the broader context of changes made to the ATP by the American Technology Preeminence Act. NIST believes that it
was the intent of Congress to provide title to inventions directly to U.S. companies as the most effective means of
assuring that research results enter the marketplace rapidly, and in the way most beneficial to United States businesses.
In this context, NIST notes that the Act contains a new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures''
funded by ATP must be industry-led. NIST also notes the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to nonprofit
independent research organizations. (See sections 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively, of the American
Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, NIST believes that the only reasonable reading of section 201(c)(6) is to interpret the term ``United States-owned
company'' as referring to businesses, and specifically, to for-profit entities.

Section 295.8 (b) and (c)&blank;Copyright and Publication_(24 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of universities have expressed fear that the new ATP rules will prevent universities or their employees from
copyrighting their works. The fear is also raised that the ATP rule will require universities to get the permission
of their for-profit collaborators before publishing their research findings. In response, NIST notes that the parts
of the ATP rule dealing with the questions raised by these comments on copyright and publication were not proposed
to be substantively changed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of August 2, 1993. In the old rule, the provision on copyright was found in &sect;295.5(b), and the treatment
of publication of research results was found at &sect;295.8(d). In the new rule, the provision on copyright is found
in &sect;295.8(b), and the treatment of publication of research results is at &sect;295.8(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old &sect;295.5(b) concerned the governmental
use license that each ATP funding recipient is required to provide to NIST for any copyrighted data first produced
in the performance of the ATP award. The scope of the governmental use license has been truncated by deleting the authority
of the government to distribute computer programs first produced in the performance of the ATP award to users in the
United States. The ability of funding recipients to copyright the works of their employees remains unchanged. Both
the old and new versions of the ATP regulation state that ``funding recipients'' can copyright works made under ATP.
Universities that receive funds under ATP are ``funding recipients''. They are funding recipients if they are members
of joint ventures. They are funding recipients if they are subcontractors. Universities get copyright. Accordingly,
no change is made to &sect;295.8(c) of the regulation based upon the comments described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old &sect;295.5(d) was to delete the first part
of the first sentence. That sentence originally read: ``Although the program will encourage the timely publication
of research results by funding recipients, the decision on whether to publish or not will be made by the funding recipient(s).''
In the proposed revision, the sentence was revised to read simply ``The decision on whether to publish or not will be
made by the funding recipient(s).'' NIST believes that the regulation is very clear that the decision to publish shall
be made by negotiated agreement of the funding recipients and that the for-profit members of a joint venture will not
be able to dictate to universities on this matter. This provision has been part of every ATP award made since 1990, and
no difficulties have arisen under it. Accordingly, no change is made to section 295.8(c) of the proposed regulation
based upon the comments described above.

Section 295.14&blank;Special Financial Reporting_(5 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two universities and three other not-for-profit organizations commented on proposed section 295.14, which would
increase the flexibility of financial reporting requirements and encourage award recipients to retain independent
CPA firms to perform audit services, while reserving the right of the Department of Commerce's Office of the Inspector
General to determine the timing and nature of these services, and to conduct its own audit. The comments suggested
a need for greater specificity as to the applicable OMB regulations which might apply and the conditions under which
the Departmental Inspector General would exercise his authority in setting the time frame and scope of audit services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the regulations have been amended to state that the audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing
Standards'' subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''.
Clarifying changes have also been made to the definitions of ``direct costs'' found at &sect;295.2(c) and ``indirect
costs'' found at &sect;295.2(h).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent urged that state and local governments and U.S. universities and non-profit research institutes
working independently should be eligible to receive individual ATP awards outside of joint ventures. No change has
been made to the regulation based upon this comment because eligibility for individual awards is expressly limited
to United States companies by section 278n(b)(2) of title 15 of the United States Code.

This final rule relating to grants, benefits, and contracts is exempt from the delayed effective date requirement,
and accordingly, under section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), is therefore being
made effective immediately without a 30 day delay in effective date.

This document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The General Counsel
certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, at the time this rule was proposed that,
if it were adopted as proposed it would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
requiring a flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This is because there are only a small number
of awardees and thus only a small number of awards will be given to small businesses. The program is entirely voluntary
for the participants that seek funding. It is not a major federal action requiring an environmental assessment under
the National Environment Policy Act. This rule contains collection of information requirements subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act approved by OMB under control number 0693&hyph;0009. The Advanced Technology Program does not involve
the mandatory payment of any matching funds from a state or local government, and does not affect directly any state
or local government. Accordingly, the Technology Administration has determined that Executive Order 12372 is not
applicable to this program. This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant
preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The purpose of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) is to assist United States businesses to carry out research
and development on pre-competitive generic technologies. These technologies are: (1) Enabling, because they offer
wide breadth of potential application and form an important technical basis for future commercial applications;
and (2) high value, because when applied, they offer significant benefits to the U.S. economy. Precompetitive technology
is defined in &sect;295.2(n) and generic technology is defined in &sect;295.2(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of joint research and development ventures involving potential competitors, the willingness of firms
to commit significant amounts of corporate resources to the venture is evidence that the proposed research and development
is precompetitive. For joint ventures that involve firms and their customers or suppliers or for single firms not
proposing cooperative research and development, a quantified description of the expected broad applicability
of the technology and adequate assurances that the technology being developed will be utilized widely can provide
evidence that the proposed research and development is pre-competitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) These rules prescribe policies and procedures for the award of cooperative agreements under the advanced Technology
Program in order to ensure the fair treatment of all proposals. While the Advanced Technology Program is authorized
to enter into grants, competitive agreements, and contracts to carry out its mission, these rules address only the
award of cooperative agreements. The Program employs cooperative agreements rather than grants because such agreements
allow ATP to exercise appropriate management oversight of projects and also to link ATP-funded projects to ongoing
R&amp;D at the National Institute of Standards and Technology wherever such linkage would increase the likelihood
of success of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 295.2 is amended by revising paragraph (a), redesignating paragraphs (d) through (i) as paragraphs (k)

method used by the applicant for that equipment prior to the award. The value of equipment will be further pro-rated
according to the share of total use dedicated to carrying out the proposed ATP work program. The total value of equipment
expenditures allowable under the match may be applied in the award year expended or pro-rated over the duration of
award years. The total in-kind value of equipment expenditures can not exceed 30% of the applicant's total annual
share of matching funds. The total in-kind value of part-time personnel can not exceed 20% of the applicant's total

(a) A company shall be eligible to receive an award from the Program only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Program finds that the company's participation in the Program would be in the economic interest of the United
States, as evidenced by investments in the United States in research, development, and manufacturing (including,
for example, the manufacture of major components or subassemblies in the United States); significant contributions
to employment in the United States; and agreement with respect to any technology arising from assistance provided
by the Program to promote the manufacture within the United States of products resulting from that technology (taking
into account the goals of promoting the competitiveness of United States industry), and to procure parts and materials
from competitive suppliers; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Either the company is a United States-owned company, or the Program finds that the company is incorporated in the
United States and has a parent company which is incorporated in a country which affords to United States-owned companies
opportunities, comparable to those afforded to any other company, to participate in any joint venture similar to
those authorized under the Program; affords the United States-owned companies local investment opportunities
comparable to those afforded to any other company; and affords adequate and effective protection for the intellectual
property rights of United States-owned companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Program may, within 30 days after notice to Congress, suspend a company or joint venture from continued assistance
under the Program if the Program determines that the company, the country of incorporation of the company or a parent
company, or the joint venture has failed to satisfy any of the criteria contained in paragraph (a) of this section,
and that it is in the national interest of the United States to do so.

 The selection process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The selection process for awards is a multi-step process based on the criteria listed in &sect;295.6. In the first
step, called ``preliminary screening,'' proposals are eliminated that do not meet the requirements of this rule
or the program announcement. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for eliminating a proposal at this stage is that
the proposal: is deemed to have serious deficiencies in either the technical or business plan; or does not meet the
definition of precompetitive, generic technology; or, is not industry-led; or is significantly overpriced or underpriced
given the scope of the work; or does not meet the requirements set out in the Notice of Availability of Funds issued pursuant
to &sect;295.7; or in the case of joint ventures, requests more than a minority share of funding. NIST will also examine
proposals that have been submitted to a previous competition to determine whether substantive revisions have been
made to the earlier proposal, and if not, may reject the proposal or forward it to a later stage in the review process
based upon the earlier review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the second step, referred to as the ``technical and business review,'' proposals are evaluated under the criteria
found in &sect;295.6. Proposals are rated as ``not recommended'' or ``recommended.'' Proposals must have high scientific
and technical merit to be recommended. Only those proposals rated as ``recommended'' are considered further. These
applicants are referred to as ``semifinalists.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In the third step, referred to as ``selection of finalists,'' the Program prepares a final scoring and ranking
of semifinalist proposals. During this step, the semifinalist proposers may be asked to make oral presentations
on their proposals at NIST, and in some cases site visits may be required. Subject to the provisions of &sect;295.6,
a list of ranked finalists is submitted to the selecting official.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) In the final step, referred to as ``selection of awardees,'' the Selecting Official selects funding recipients
from among the finalists, based upon (1) the rank order of the applications on the basis of all selection criteria (&sect;295.6);
(2) assuring an appropriate distribution of funds among technologies and activities, and (3) the availability of
funds. The Program reserves the right to withhold awards in any case where a search of Federal records discloses information
that raises a reasonable doubt as to the responsibility of the applicant. The decision of the Selecting Official is
final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If a joint venture is ranked as a finalist, but the Program determines that the joint venture contains weaknesses
in its structure or cohesiveness that may substantially lessen the probability of the proposed program being completed
successfully, the Program may inform the applicant of the deficiencies and enter into negotiations with the applicant
in an effort to remedy the deficiencies. If appropriate, funding up to 10 percent of the amount originally requested
by the applicant may be awarded by the Program to the applicant to assist in overcoming the organizational deficiencies.
If the Program determines within six months of this award that the organizational deficiencies have been corrected,
the Program may award the remaining funds requested by the applicant to that applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) NIST reserves the right to negotiate with applicants selected to receive awards the cost and scope of the proposed
work, e.g., to add or delete a task to improve the probability of success.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reduce proposal preparation costs incurred by applicants and to make the selection process more efficient, NIST
may use a preliminary qualification process based on abbreviated proposals. Announcements requesting abbreviated
proposals will be published as indicated in &sect;295.7, seeking proposals that address all of the selection criteria,
but in considerably less detail than full proposals. The Program will review the abbreviated proposals and select
those that best meet the selection criteria. Submitters of abbreviated proposals will be notified in writing whether
their proposals are recommended for full proposal, or, not recommended for full proposal. Those whose proposals
are recommended for full proposal submission will be invited to prepare and submit full proposals. Those not invited
to submit proposals may nonetheless elect to do so, and will have an equal opportunity for selection. When the full
proposals are received, the review and selection process will continue as described in &sect;295.4.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Appropriateness of the technical risk and feasibility of the project; that is, is there a sufficient knowledge

toward commercial application, either through their own organization(s) or through others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Degree to which proposal identifies potential applications of the technology and provides evidence that the
applicant has credible plans to assure prompt and widespread use of the technology if the R&amp;D is successful and
to ensure adequate protection of the intellectual property by the participant(s) and, as appropriate, by other U.S.
businesses.

Extent to which the proposer assigns the company's best people to the project. Priority given to this work vis-a-vis
other projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For joint ventures, the extent to which the joint venture has been structured (vertical integration, horizontal
integration, or both) so as to include sufficient participants possessing all of the skills required to complete
successfully the proposed work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For joint ventures, appropriate participation by small businesses. ``Small business'' is defined in &sect;295.2(q).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Appropriateness of subcontractor/supplier/collaborator participation and relationships (where applicable).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Clarity and appropriateness of management plan. Extent to which the proposers have clarified who is responsible
for each task, and the chain of command. Extent to which those responsible for the work have adequate authority and
access to higher level management.

(2) Quality and appropriateness of the technical staff to carry out the proposed work program and to identify and overcome
barriers to meeting project objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Past performance of the company or joint venture members in carrying out similar kinds of efforts successfully,
including technology application. Consideration of this factor in the case of a start-up company or new joint venture,
will take into account the past performance of the key people in carrying out similar kinds of efforts.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 31_``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures'', or other sound accounting
practices to be specified in the Cooperative Agreement. The audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing Standards''
subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''. Each award
will be subject to an Attestation Engagement (i.e., providing assurance on representations of compliance with statutory,
regulatory, and contractual requirements) or an audit in conjunction with the recipient's annual audit at least
every two years. In the interest of efficiency, the recipients are encouraged to retain their own independent CPA
firm to perform these services. The Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General (OIG) reserves the right
to determine the time frame and/or level of service of financial audit reports that are to be delivered and to determine
how the close-out audit is to be conducted. The use of an independent CPA firm does not preclude the OIG's right to conduct
its own audit.

We are extending the date on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings, found in appendix 1 of part 404,
subpart P, will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994. We have made no revisions in the medical
criteria in the cardiovascular system listings; they remain the same as they now appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.
We are presently considering comments we received on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to update the medical
criteria contained in part A and part B of the cardiovascular system listings. When we have completed our review, any
revised criteria will be published as final regulations.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 6, 1985, a revised Listing of Impairments in appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 50068). The Listing of Impairments describes, for each of 13 major body systems, impairments that are considered
severe enough to preclude a person from engaging in any gainful activity (part A), or in the case of a child under the
age of 18, impairments that are considered severe enough to prevent the child from functioning independently, appropriately,
and effectively in an age-appropriate manner (part B). The Listing of Impairments is used for evaluating disability
and blindness at the third step of the sequential evaluation process for adults and children under the Social Security
disability program and the supplemental security income program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the revised Listing of Impairments was published in 1985, we indicated that medical advances in disability evaluation
and treatment and program experience would require that the listings be periodically reviewed and updated. Accordingly,
we established termination dates ranging from 4 to 8 years for each of the listings for specific body systems. A date
of December 6, 1989, was established for the cardiovascular system listings in part A to no longer be effective. A date
of December 6, 1993, was established for part B of the cardiovascular system listings to no longer be effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential program impact of the changes to update the cardiovascular system listings required careful analysis
and consideration within the Agency. As our analysis continued, it became evident that we would be unable to publish
a proposed and then a final regulation containing revised criteria for part A of the cardiovascular system listings
by December 6, 1989. We published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 5, 1989 (54 FR 50233), a final regulation extending the current part A cardiovascular system listings
for a period of 18 months through June 5, 1991. The part A cardiovascular system listings were again extended an additional
12 months through June 5, 1992, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 6, 1991 (56 FR 26030), and were extended to January 5, 1993, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 5, 1992 (57 FR 23945), and to July 6, 1993, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 29, 1992 (57 FR 61795). The part A and part B cardiovascular system listings were extended to January 6,
1994, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 9, 1991, we published an NPRM proposing revisions to the medical criteria contained in parts A and B of the cardiovascular
system listings (56 FR 31266), with provisions for a 60-day comment period. The complex issues raised by the numerous
comments we received have required extensive analysis and careful consideration. In order to ensure sufficient
time for this review, we are extending the date on which the current cardiovascular system listings in parts A and B
will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy, generally follows the Administrative Procedure
Act notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its
regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures
when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists
for waiver of notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures on this rule because it only extends the
dates on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings will no longer be effective and makes no substantive
changes to these listings. The current regulations expressly provide that the listings may be extended by the Secretary,
as well as revised and promulgated again. Because we are not making any revisions to the current listings, we have determined
that use of public comment procedures is unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this final rule to temporarily
place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to
the emergency scheduling provisions of the CSA. This action is based on the finding by the Acting Administrator of
the DEA that the placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid
an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this rule, the criminal sanctions and regulatory controls of
Schedule I substances under the CSA will be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, and possession of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;473) amended section 201 of the Controlled Substances
Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 811) to give the Attorney General the authority to temporarily place a substance into Schedule
I of the CSA if it is found that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. A substance
may be temporarily scheduled under the emergency provision of the CSA if that substance is not listed in any other schedule
under Section 202 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 812) of if there is no approval or exemption in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the substance. The Attorney General has delegated his authority under 21 U.S.C. 811
to the Administrator of the DEA (28 CFR 0.100).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of intent to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 4, 1993, (58 FR 58819). The Administrator transmitted notice of his intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
into Schedule I of the CSA to the Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
In response to this notification, the Food and Drug Administration has advised DEA that there are no exemptions or
approvals in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
and HHS has no objection to DEA's intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule
I of the CSA. No other comments were received regarding this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3), the Acting Administrator has considered the following factors regarding
4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine: (1) Its history and current pattern of abuse; (2) scope, duration and significance
of abuse; and (3) what, if any, risk there is to the public health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is structurally similar to the Schedule I phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens,
4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (STP or DOM) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (DOB). Like DOM and
DOB, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine displays high affinity for central serotonin receptors and is capable
of substituting for either DOM or DOB in drug discrimination studies conducted in rats. These data suggest that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
is a psychoactive substance capable of producing effects similar, though not identical, to DOM and DOB. Data from
human studies indicate that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is orally active at 0.1&hyph;0.2 mg/kg producing
an intoxication with considerable euphoria and sensory enhancement which lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Higher doses have
been reported to produce intense and frightening hallucinations.

DEA first encountered 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Texas in 1979. Since that time, several other exhibits
of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine have been analyzed by DEA and state forensic laboratories in California,
Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Oregon, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. Clandestine laboratories producing
4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine were seized in California in 1986 and in Arizona in 1992. It has been represented
as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and has been sold in sugar cubes as LSD. More recently, it has been
promoted as an aphrodisiac and distributed under the product name of NEXUS whose purported active ingredient is brominated
cathinine. DEA has recently seized several thousand dosage units of this product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The continued clandestine production, illicit importation, distribution and abuse of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
poses an imminent hazard to public safety. DEA is not aware of any commercial use for this substance in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of section 201(h) of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)) and 28 CFR 0.100 and based on a consideration
of the requisite factors and other relevant information, the Acting Administrator finds that placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
into Schedule I of the CSA on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following regulations are effective with respect to 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine on January 6, 1994,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Acting Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
into Schedule I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This action involves the temporary control of a substance with no currently approved medical use in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is not a significant regulatory action for the
purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the provisions of E.O. 12866, section 3(d)(1). Accordingly,
this proposed emergency scheduling action is not subject to provisions of E.O. 12778 which are contingent upon review
by OMB. This regulation both responds to an emergency situation posing an imminent hazard to the public safety, and
is essential to a criminal law enforcement function of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined
that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Regulatory History

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the sponsor's late submission of the regatta application
left insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in advance of the scheduled event. However, the
Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation now as the benefits of holding the training
during the winter, as scheduled, rather than later in the spring will mean less impact on the boating public.

Background and Purposes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operation Anzio Reenactment consists of river crossing training for the 19th Engineer Battalion, Fort Knox, Kentucky.
The Training will take place over three days, January 20&hyph;22, 1994. Each day's training will begin at 12 p.m.,
and will end at 3 p.m. local time. In order to provide for the safety of spectators and participants, and for the safe
passage of through traffic, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regatta area. The river will be closed
during part or all of the effective period to all vessel traffic except participants, official regatta vessels, and
patrol craft. These regulations are issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 and 33 CFR 100.35.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant
under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of
information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact
of this regulation to be minimal due to its short duration.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures
would have been contrary to the public interest. Immediate action is needed to prevent possible loss of life and damage
to vessels in the area and to the structure itself. Although this regulation is published as a final rule without prior
notice, an opportunity for public comment is nevertheless desirable to ensure that the regulation is both reasonable
and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The circumstances creating the need for this regulation is information received by Chevron and by the Coast Guard
that vessels intend to protest and possibly interfere with drilling operations at this site. This is the first site
at which drilling will begin in this particular area, which has been a subject of controversy. Precautionary measures
for safety at a drilling site require that the structure and waters around it be maintained free of interference and
traffic in order to allow for immediate evacuation of personnel aboard the structure and by attending vessels in case
of emergency. The establishment of a safety zone will prevent non-attending vessels from remaining in close proximity
to the offshore structure and hindering any necessary evacuation of the area.

This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is nonsignificant
under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic
impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The Coast Guard certifies
that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Upper Mississippi River. This regulation is needed to control
vessel traffic in the regulated area to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area.
The regulation will prohibit navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection
of life and property associated with bridge and span removal.

Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the nature of repairs to the Burlington Highway Bridge
at mile 404.2 Upper Mississippi River leaves insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rule making. The Coast
Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period since the
conditions present an immediate hazard.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Extensive renovation of the bridge is required and removal of the center is to be accomplished from a vessel located
in the navigation channel and this action will impede normal traffic flow. As a result of these conditions this regulation
is necessary to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant
under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of
information requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
The imposed restrictions are anticipated to be of short duration. To avoid any unnecessary adverse economic impact
on businesses which use the river for commercial purposes, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri will monitor the
situation and will authorized entry into the closed area as conditions warrant. Changes will be announced by Marine
Safety Information Radio Broadcast on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHZ). Mariners may also call the Port
Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823 for current information.

Regulatory History

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a bridge is being removed from a navigable waterway. Bridge
removal operations pose inherent risks to the waterway because the structure is progressively weakened as the operation
proceeds. Once commenced, such operations should be completed as quickly as possible. Removal operations involving
structural supports for this bridge have proceeded ahead of schedule, leaving insufficient time to publish a notice
of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting
for a comment period, as immediate implementation of navigation restrictions is needed to ensure the safety of vessels
transitting the area and to minimize the time a bridge in a weakened condition remains over the waterway.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Port Vue Bridge located at mile 1.3 on the Youghiogheny River is not longer an active highway bridge and must be removed.
The bridge consists of several small spans that are located over land and one 310-foot main span that crosses over the
navigable waterway. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, this main span will be demolished with five simultaneously
detonated explosive charges. This explosion, which will create an obvious hazard to vessels transitting the area,
will occur at approximately 10 a.m. on January 8, 1994. After the explosives on this span are detonated, the steel and
other debris from the bridge will fall into the navigable waters of the Youghiogheny River, creating an unsafe condition
of vessels. The contractor will immediately commence clearing operations, but it will require 48 hours to restore
the navigability of this section of the Youghiogheny River. Accordingly, during that period, no traffic will be permitted
in the safety zone, as it would be unsafe for vessels attempting to transit and such transit attempts would interfere
with the debris clearing operations.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant
under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of
information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact
of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the relatively
small size of the area regulated, and the absence of any commercial vessel transits along this section of the Youghiogheny
River, due to insufficient bridge clearances and water depth downriver.

Federalism Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation
as an action required to protect public safety.

The regulations that appear at 38 CFR 4.87a, diagnostic code 6210, establish the criteria for evaluating disease
of the auditory canal. Due to VA error, that criteria contains the word ``serious'' instead of the word ``serous.''

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is today promulgating changes to its fuel economy calculation regulations to conform to changes in the Motor Vehicle
Information &amp; Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2), made by section 371 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993 (NAFTA Implementation Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182 (December 8, 1993).
Section 104(a)(2) of the NAFTA Implementation Act specifically provides that ``appropriate officers of the United
States Government may issue such regulations *&blank;*&blank;* as may be necessary to ensure that any *&blank;*&blank;*
amendment made by this Act, that takes effect on the date the Agreement enters into force is appropriately implemented
on such date.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MVICSA, 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(1), specifies that the EPA Administrator is to separate passenger automobiles manufactured
by a manufacturer into foreign and domestic fleets, and to calculate the average fuel economy of each category separately.
Prior to the NAFTA Implementation Act, 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2) specified that an automobile is to be considered domestically
manufactured in any model year if at least 75% of the cost to the manufacturer is attributable to value added in the United
States or Canada, unless the assembly is completed in Canada and the automobile is not imported into the United States
prior to the expiration of 30 days following the end of the model year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 371 of the NAFTA Implementation Act simply adds a new subparagraph (G) to 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2) extending domestic
treatment to costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added in Mexico, according to an explicit phase-in schedule.
The statutory change does not alter the current treatment of costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added
in the United States or Canada. Pursuant to clause (iii) in new subparagraph (G), the Secretary of Transportation
is to prescribe reasonable procedures for manufacturers to make elections for the phase-in schedules described
in today's regulations, and the EPA Administrator may prescribe rules for carrying out subparagraph (G). Today,
EPA is amending its regulations governing the determination of domestic production to include the provisions of
new subparagraph (G) in 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2).

II. Environmental Effects and Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the NAFTA Implementation Act does not give EPA discretion as to the content of these regulations and because
Congress required the regulations to become effective less than a month after enactment of this Act, the Agency has
not conducted detailed analyses of the environmental and economic impacts separate from the analyses that were done
on the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Public Participation and Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Agency is not using notice and comment
rulemaking procedures to promulgate this rule because the Agency has found that notice is unnecessary and impracticable.
Comment is unnecessary because the rule issued today merely conforms pre-existing regulations as required by the
NAFTA Implementation Act and does not involve an exercise of discretion by the Administrator. Furthermore, comment
is impracticable because the NAFTA Implementation Act allowed the Administrator less than one month between the
date of enactment and the date by which the regulations must be effective. It is impracticable to have notice-and-comment
rulemaking completed in such a short time. This short time period is consistent with EPA's view that it is performing
a ministerial act that is not subject to notice and comment rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule is being made effective sooner than 30 days after publication or service. This is permitted by section 553(d)
of the Administrative Procedure Act when the Agency finds good cause and publishes it with the rule. The Agency finds
that there is good cause. The regulation needs to be effective on January 1, 1994, to avoid having the statute (which
goes into effect on January 1, 1994) differ from the implementing regulations. In addition, the statutory provision
itself will go into effect less than 30 days after it was enacted, which precludes EPA from providing 30 days between
publication or service and the effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required and does not expect this change to be controversial,
as it directly incorporates the explicit provisions of the statutory amendment into the current regulations. Nonetheless,
EPA will accept comments on these regulatory changes and will consider making changes if justified by the comments.

IV. Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority for the actions promulgated in this final rule is granted to EPA by section 371 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;182. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Administrative Designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore,
subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines a ``significant regulatory action''
as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1990, which requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts
of federal regulations upon small entities, does not apply to this rulemaking. Section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act requires analyses only for final rules for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. As discussed
in section III, a general notice of rulemaking would be unnecessary and impracticable and, thus, is not required for
this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA must obtain Office of Management and Budget clearance for any activity that will involve collecting substantially
the same information from ten or more non-Federal respondents. This regulation does not impose any new information
requirements or contain any new information collection requirements and will result in no change in the reporting
burden.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule issues technical amendments to Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations intended to simplify and improve our system for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the performance of fiscal intermediaries and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers in the administration of the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, we evaluate intermediaries using performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards announced in an annual notice in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. We are clarifying the methodology for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing these criteria and standards. For consistency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we establish comparable regulation requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of carrier performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These revisions are published in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1816(f) and 1842(b)(2) of the Social Security Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which require us to develop standards, criteria, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to evaluate an intermediary's or carrier's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall performance.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1816(a) of the Social Security Act (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act), public or private organizations and agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the administration of Part A (Hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insurance) of the Medicare program under agreements with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies or organizations are known as fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries, and they perform bill processing and benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment functions for the Medicare program. Under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1842(a) of the Act, the Secretary is authorized to enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into contracts with carriers to fulfill various functions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administration of Part B (Supplementary Medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insurance) of the Medicare program. Beneficiaries, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physicians and suppliers of the services submit claims to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these carriers that, in turn, make appropriate payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1980 for intermediaries and in 1981 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers, we have been evaluating the effectiveness and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of contractor operations through a system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards called the Contractor Performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation Program (CPEP).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We refer to the performance requirements we use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the performance of intermediaries and carriers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting their contractual obligations to HCFA in our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and program instructions as criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. When we developed our regulations, criteria were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be distinguished from standards; we intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure broad categorizations of performance using criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(42 CFR 421.120) and to measure statistical and performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data using standards (&sect;421.122). As planned, a contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had to be evaluated by and pass the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria before we evaluated contractor performance using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical standards. However, in practice, the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been used to measure a contractor's compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the criteria. The separate reliance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical standards diminished and we have developed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPEP under which standards are used to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of specific activities in a defined criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead of ``statistical'' standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1992, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(57 FR 57125) a proposed rule describing technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions we proposed to make to Medicare regulations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to simplify and improve our system for evaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performances of fiscal intermediaries and carriers in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the Medicare program. These technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions are necessary to bring our regulations up to date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with our actual use of criteria and standards in performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the proposed rule we described how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reliance on statistical standards diminished and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current ``standards'' are used to measure the performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific activities in a defined criterion. That is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement and evaluation using criteria and standards have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evolved into a one-step process. In addition, we noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain functions that were included in the original planned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation structure have been transferred to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate review activities. We, therefore, proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend &sect;&sect;421.3, 421.112(b), 421.118(b) and 421.122 to delete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to statistical standards and to replace the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standards for the areas evaluated formerly by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical standards with a general explanation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas evaluated by performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also mentioned in the proposed rule that our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations do not contain requirements relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of carrier performance that are parallel to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those for intermediaries. For consistency, we proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a new &sect;421.201, ``Performance Criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards,'' that would measure and evaluate carrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of functional responsibilities, such as, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate and timely processing of claims, responsiveness to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries', physicians' and suppliers' concerns, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper management of administrative funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to base performance criteria and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the experience of carriers nationwide, changes in carrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations due to fiscal constraints, and our objectives in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving better performance. Before the beginning of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPEP evaluation period, we would publish the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also announced that we would add a new &sect;421.203, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Carrier's failure to perform efficiently and effectively,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to explain the adverse action that may be taken by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary if the carrier fails to meet criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards specified at &sect;421.201. The content is parallel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to &sect;421.124, which applies to intermediaries. This new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;421.203 does not add or change carrier obligations. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely codifies in regulations a provision specific to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers that has been in effect since Public Law 98&hyph;369. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Analysis of and Response to Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received 10 timely items of correspondence in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to the December 3, 1992 proposed rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments were from intermediaries, carriers, contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocacy groups, and provider advocacy groups. A summary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments and the Department's responses follow: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be developed by HCFA for receiving comments, complaints, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems with carrier performance by physicians or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional organizations and that the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by this process be included in the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance evaluation of a carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning in Fiscal Year 1994, HCFA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review both intermediaries' and carriers' efforts to enhance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customer satisfaction through the use of customer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction surveys, including the National Physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survey. Results of the surveys will be used to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance data on customer satisfaction and to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas in need of improvement. The results will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarized for publication in the report of contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of the commenters believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain of our proposed changes at &sect;&sect;421.124 and 421.203 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unnecessary. Those changes would allow the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take adverse action if an intermediary or carrier exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount the Secretary finds to be reasonable and adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the costs which must be incurred by an efficiently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and economically operated intermediary or carrier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notwithstanding whether the intermediary or carrier meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the published criteria and standards. Both the intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and carrier contracts currently have a provision to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to request a committee of the contractors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist in efforts to effect improvements in the high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractor's performance. In addition, the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contractor Performance Evaluation Program (CPEP) contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures on contractor costs. If a contractor fails to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable criteria, its CPEP score is reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not agree that the proposed changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unnecessary. This section of the regulation would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize us to take adverse action for deficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of a function not specifically evaluated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPEP. Currently, CPEP only measures contractor performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in meeting the approved budget and the contractor's relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standing among similar contractors. Moreover, beginning in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FY 1993, CPEP eliminated the concept of passing/failing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall evaluation. Passing/failing now is determined on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard by standard basis. For example, if a contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fails to meet the approved budget, it will fail one standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in CPEP, not the entire CPEP. Thus, despite CPEP, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to take adverse contract action against high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries and carriers is necessary. As the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note, current contracts allow the Secretary to request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee of the contractors to assist in efforts to effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements in the high cost contractor's performance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulatory change allows us to take the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logical step in the event efforts to effect improvement have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed. We will have authority to take adverse action based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on continued high cost performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stressed that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;421.124 and &sect;421.203 were vague. They asked that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further define ``reasonable'' amount, and how and when high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost would be calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that the provisions at &sect;421.124 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and &sect;421.203 are clear and straightforward. It is our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to consider the funding levels that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable and adequate to meet the costs incurred by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiently and economically operated contractor. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address this responsibility, we develop unit cost targets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each contractor prior to the start of every fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These unit cost targets are forwarded to the HCFA regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices as part of the Budget and Performance Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BPRs) package and represent the benchmark for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations between the regional offices and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the composition of a contractor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload (for example, number of hospital inpatient bills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus number of outpatient bills or laboratory bills, etc.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an important factor in the amount of costs it incurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since some claims are inherently more problematic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to resolve. In order to give full consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each contractor's unique situation, we currently apply a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``complexity index'' to develop the BPRs' unit cost targets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This methodology allows us to correlate the contractor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs with its individual workload composition. The use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complexity index allows us to identify the contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose unit costs appear to be out of proportion to the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and medium (electronic versus hardcopy) of workload they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the complexity index methodology allows us to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate each contractor's costs with full consideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its unique workload mix and within the national forum of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peers. In this way, we identify our high cost contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since the use of the complexity index methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an administrative tool to identify contractors with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aberrant costs and can be changed or modified as required, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we do not believe it necessary to outline this methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulation.

Several commenters stated that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;421.124(a) and 421.203(a) on high cost contractors do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify the types of adverse action we may take on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds of excessive cost. Contractors are uncertain about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how we would go about the process of applying sanctions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what these sanctions might be.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adverse contract actions are listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;421.124(a) and 421.203(a) of the proposed regulation, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are not limited to those. Adverse contract actions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further defined in the intermediary and carrier manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuances released within the HCFA Program Manual Issuances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System, which contain the details of the CPEP. Adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions range in severity commensurate with relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance and include, but are not limited to, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions as, Regional Office Letter of Admonition; Central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office Letter of Admonition; deletion of the automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal clause from the contract without performance goals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established; deletion of the automatic renewal clause from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract with performance goals established; limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract automatic-renewal clause and provision for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination upon 90 days notice; reduction in territory or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter was unsure whether, if HCFA does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not publish the CPEP standards during a fiscal year, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be no performance evaluation for that year or whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous year's CPEP would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the evaluation period which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards measure is the Federal fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We make every effort to publish the criteria and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the beginning of the Federal fiscal year, that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1st. If we do not publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the new fiscal year begins, readers may presume that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until and unless notified otherwise, the criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards which were previously in effect remain in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a new CPEP is published, it usually applies to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective period, as stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter states that contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in pilot projects which may involve additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding from HCFA. They assume this ``additional funding'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be considered as ``excessively high costs''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We encourage contractors to participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot projects which may result in improved quality, service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or efficiency in the administration of the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a contractor's participation in a pilot study or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program adversely affects its performance evaluation,

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommends that HCFA not base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards on the sliding scale of available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding but on true expectations of performance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore delete ``changes in fiscal operations due to fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constraints'' as a basis for developing criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each year the specific standards are revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and developed in concert with the specific budget and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance requirements, because that is the fiscally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible approach to develop uniform and fair performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for the Medicare contractor community. We will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to develop standards in conjunction with budget and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance requirements.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter notes that &sect;&sect;421.124 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
421.203 do not include the contract's provision for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the contract, subject to cost limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would deprive high cost contractors of the formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to choose between accepting limits on their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursable costs and losing their Medicare contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contract allows us to offer a high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractor the option of submitting a lower budget or losing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its Medicare contract. Sections 421.124 and 421.203 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give us the authority to determine the amount which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable and adequate to efficiently and economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate as an intermediary and carrier. If we determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we cannot afford to contract with high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries or carriers, we may consider appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse contract action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Provisions of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on our review of the comments submitted, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making no substantive changes to the proposed revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules affecting criteria and standards for evaluating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries and carriers as published on December 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, (57 FR 233). Only minor editorial and technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions have been made to the proposed rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermediary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an entity that has a contract with HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine and make Medicare payments for Part A or Part B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits payable on a cost basis (or under the Prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Payment System for hospitals) and to perform other related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions. For purposes of designating regional or alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional intermediaries for home health agencies and of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designating intermediaries for hospices under &sect;421.117 as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as for applying the performance criteria in &sect;421.120 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards in &sect;421.122 and any adverse action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from such application, the term intermediary also means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Blue Cross Plan which has entered into a subcontract approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HCFA with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform intermediary functions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In &sect;421.112(b), ``statistical standards'' is revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read ``performance standards''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. In &sect;421.118(b) ``statistical standards'' is revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read ``performance standards''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Section 421.122 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.122 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Development of standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance criteria (&sect;421.120), HCFA develops detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards for use in evaluating intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance which may be based on historical performance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of acceptable statistical measures of variation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide intermediary experience during a base period, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changing program emphases or requirements. These standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also developed considering intermediary experience and evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specific requirements of each functional responsibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Factors beyond intermediary's control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable factors that significantly affect an intermediary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance, but that are not within the intermediary's control, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Study the performance of intermediaries during the base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consider the noncontrollable factors in developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Publication of standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The development and revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of standards for evaluating intermediary performance is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing process. Therefore, before the beginning of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year period of October 1&hyph;September 30, HCFA publishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the performance standards as part of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing the performance criteria issued under &sect;421.120(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before the beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as the evaluation period of the intermediaries for the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards begins after the publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 421.124 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.124 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Intermediary's failure to perform efficiently and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Failure by an intermediary to meet, or to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capacity to meet, the criteria or standards specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;421.120 and 421.122 may be grounds for adverse action by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or by HCFA, such as reassignment of providers, offer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a short-term agreement, termination of a contract, or non-renewal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a contract. If an intermediary meets all criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in its overall performance, but does not meet them with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to a specific provider or class of providers, HCFA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reassign that provider or class of providers to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary in accordance with &sect;421.114. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In addition, notwithstanding whether an intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the criteria and standards, if the cost incurred by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount which HCFA finds to be reasonable and adequate to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated intermediary, those high costs may also be grounds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In subpart C a new &sect;421.201 is added to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Performance criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of performance criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the carrier evaluations mandated by section 1842(b)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, HCFA periodically assesses the performance of carriers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their Medicare operations using performance criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The criteria measure and evaluate carrier performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional responsibilities such as_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Accurate and timely payment determinations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Responsiveness to beneficiary, physician, and supplier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Proper management of administrative funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The standards evaluate the specific requirements of each functional responsibility or criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA bases the performance criteria and standards on_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nationwide carrier experience;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Changes in carrier operations due to fiscal constraints; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) HCFA's objectives in achieving better performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Publication of criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the beginning of each evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal fiscal year period of October
1&hyph;September 30, HCFA publishes the performance criteria and standards as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before
the beginning of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the criteria and standards after the Federal
fiscal year begins, as long as the evaluation period of the carriers for the new criteria and standards begins after
the publication of the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A new &sect;421.203 is added to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.203
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Carrier's failure to perform efficiently and effectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Failure by a carrier to meet, or demonstrate the capacity to meet, the criteria and standards specified in &sect;421.201
may be grounds for adverse action by the Secretary, such as contract termination or non-renewal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding whether or not a carrier meets the criteria and standards specified in &sect;421.201, if the
cost incurred by the carrier to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the amount that HCFA finds to be reasonable
and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically operated carrier, those high
costs may also be grounds for adverse action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule amends certain personnel requirements for cytotechnologists that perform testing in laboratories subject
to the requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). We are providing an adequate
period of time for individuals to gain the necessary 2 years experience performing cytology testing which is currently
included in two of the provisions for qualifying as a cytotechnologist. Also, we are extending the time for individuals
to either meet the educational qualifications by virtue of completing training in an approved cytotechnology training
program or be certified by an approved organization. We are making these changes to prevent the loss of qualified personnel
in the field of cytotechnology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 28, 1992, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 57 FR 7002, rules that set forth the test performance requirements for laboratories that are subject to the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). We subsequently published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a related rule (January 19, 1993 (58 FR 5215)) that made technical corrections and addressed immediate concerns raised
by some of the approximately 16,000 comments on the publication of the February 28 regulations. This rule responds
to concerns raised by some of the commenters and pertains to limited aspects of the CLIA requirements: The period of
time during which an individual who needs 2 years experience as a cytotechnologist is allowed to earn that experience,
and the period of time that a person may either obtain appropriate training in a school approved by the Commission on
Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) or be certified by an organization approved by HHS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The February 28, 1992 CLIA regulations represented establishment of uniform personnel standards for cytotechnologists
for all laboratories offering cytology, regardless of location. Prior to these regulations, individuals working
in hospital cytology laboratories that were not licensed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 to
test specimens in interstate commerce were not subject to Federal personnel qualification requirements for cytotechnologists.
In addition, individuals employed in cytology laboratories that were not approved to participate in the Medicare
or Medicaid program were not subject to Federal requirements, including personnel requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the February 28, 1992 regulations, we stated that in developing the personnel standards for cytotechnologists,
it was not our intention to put out of work individuals currently employed as cytotechnologists. Our aim was to provide
qualification standards that would ensure quality of service and be in the best interest of the public health. Recognizing
the existing shortage of laboratory personnel, particularly cytotechnologists, we stated that we were expanding
the qualification requirements to allow individuals additional methods of qualifying. We stated, ``In our opinion,
many individuals currently working in laboratories, as a function of their employment, have gained valuable experience
in testing operations. In most instances in this rule, we are acknowledging the value of this experience, by allowing
those individuals, who do not meet the qualification requirements in these regulations, to continue their laboratory
employment while acquiring the education or training necessary to meet the requirements. The net effect of the personnel
standards will be to permit a preponderance of personnel presently working in laboratories to continue their employment
while they are updating their credentials to meet the national standards for laboratory personnel specified in this
rule.'' (57 FR 7083)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To &sect;493.1483, Standard: Cytotechnologist Qualifications, we added several alternative qualification standards
for cytotechnologists with education or experience requirements that had to be met by the effective date of the regulations
(September 1, 1992) or by a specified later date. To the previous Federal requirements, we added at &sect;493.1483(b)(4)
a current work experience requirement that had to be met by September 1, 1992, which was applicable to those individuals
who received their cytotechnology training and acquired their work experience prior to January 1, 1969. At &sect;493.1483(b)(5),
we added a new provision requiring current work experience by September 1, 1993, in addition to requiring on or before
September 1, 1994, that individuals either complete their cytotechnology training in an approved school or be certified
in cytotechnology by an organization approved by HHS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Revisions to the Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have now determined that we did not provide sufficient time for cytotechnologists to meet current standards. Without
prior notification, the February 28, 1992 rule required individuals, who obtained their education and training
prior to January 1, 1969, 6 months to acquire 2 years of current work experience. Also, individuals, who trained outside
of the United States, were given 1 year and 6 months to fulfill the requirement of 2 years for current work experience
in the United States. Therefore, we are revising the dates originally published in the February 28, 1992 rule at &sect;493.1483(b)
(4) and (5) concerning personnel requirements for cytotechnologists who qualified under Federal regulations and
for individuals who trained outside of the United States. Based on public concern and our analysis of anticipated
availability of qualified individuals, we are revising our regulations to allow all individuals 2 full years from
September 1, 1992, the effective date of our personnel requirements, to gain the necessary experience to qualify
under the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in &sect;493.1483(b)(4), we are revising the date from September 1, 1992 to September 1, 1994, to enable
a previously qualified cytotechnologist to continue working without interruption and obtain the necessary work
experience. In &sect;493.1483(b)(5)(i), we are similarly revising the date from September 1, 1993 to September
1, 1994 to allow an individual trained outside the United States and an individual who does not meet the other qualification
standards an opportunity to obtain the 2 years of slide examination experience within the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a technical revision to our rules, we note that &sect;493.1483(b)(5)(ii) provides that an individual qualifying
as a cytotechnologist must, on or before September 1, 1994, have either graduated from a school of cytotechnology
approved by the CAHEA or be certified by an organization approved by the Department. It is possible that the CAHEA may
cease to function as an accrediting organization before the Department has recognized any alternative certifying
organization. In order to prevent the possibility that individuals will not have 2 full years to be certified by an
approved certifying organization, we are extending the date from September 1, 1994 to September 1, 1995. This will
allow time for the Department to recognize organizations that certify cytology personnel and minimize the loss of
currently employed individuals at a time when there is an existing shortage of qualified cytology personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also making a conforming change to &sect;493.1483(b)(1) to provide that a school of cytotechnology must be
accredited by CAHEA ``or other organization approved by HHS.''

III. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay of Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invite public comment on proposed requirements. The notice of proposed rulemaking includes a reference to the
legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms and substances of the proposed rule or a description
of the subjects and issues involved. This procedure can be waived, however, if an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment
procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest and incorporates a statement of the
finding and its reasons in the rule issued.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that these revisions are essential to the effective implementation of the CLIA program, and to delay the
effective date would potentially disrupt public access to laboratory services, unnecessarily expose laboratories
to greater costs than are needed to help assure quality testing, and create unnecessary confusion among laboratories
in understanding the standards they must meet. Without immediate revision of the regulations, we believe there may
be shortages of cytotechnologists in some areas resulting in limited access to cytology services. Therefore, we
believe it is contrary to the public interest to go through a notice-and-comment procedure, and we find good cause
to waive the notice of proposed rulemaking and to issue this final rule on an interim basis. For these same reasons,
we find there is good cause to dispense with a delayed effective date of these regulations. Although the regulations
are final and effective on the date of publication, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment.

IV. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all laboratories are considered to be small entities.
Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule with comment period revises personnel requirements for cytotechnologists by extending the dates
by which they must meet the qualification requirements. We are unable to quantify the number of individuals, laboratories,
or rural hospitals affected by this rule. In the laboratory industry generally, recent surveys indicate that 80 percent
of U.S. laboratories have experienced a shortage of technical personnel. A shortage of cytotechnologists throughout
the United States has been demonstrated through anecdotal studies of wages and vacancy rates. According to the American
Hospital Association's 1991 Survey of Human Resources, there was a full-time equivalent vacancy rate of 12.2 percent
for cytotechnologists in hospital laboratories. The survey also reported that more than 60 days were required to
fill almost two-thirds of the full-time vacancies. The average length of time required to fill approximately half
of the full-time vacancies was over 90 days. This scarcity level existed prior to the imposition of Federal personnel
standards that might lead to lesser numbers of qualified cytotechnologists.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of a registry that indicates the actual number of cytotechnologists, their employment and age distribution,
the amount and type of work they do, and the specific number of individuals that meet all the qualifications except
the two years' experience, we cannot determine the cause of this shortage or predict when the shortage will end. Based
on data projections from the Census Bureau and the National Health Interview Survey, the demand for Pap smears in women
18 and older was nearly 79 million in 1992 and is expected to increase. If there is an existing shortage of personnel
and we anticipate the increased demand for cytology services, the impact of this regulation would be beneficial to
laboratories because it will allow larger numbers of cytotechnologists to meet Federal personnel requirements.
Although we cannot determine whether this final rule's provisions to allow a longer period of time for certain individuals
to accumulate required experience will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities or small
rural hospitals, because of the lack of data, we have determined that its impact is beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, one of the new methods of qualifying as a cytotechnologist includes graduation, by September
1, 1994, from a CAHEA-approved school. In the event that CAHEA should cease to function as an accrediting agency prior
to September 1, 1994, individuals may not be able to avail themselves of this method of qualifying as a cytotechnologist.
To accommodate individuals seeking to qualify under this provision, we are extending the date of graduation to September
1, 1995. This should provide sufficient time for us to formally recognize another accrediting organization, if that
becomes necessary.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS announces the 1994 fishery specifications and management measures for groundfish taken in the U.S. exclusive
economic zone and state waters off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California as authorized by the Pacific Coast
Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The specifications include the level of the acceptable biological catch
(ABC) and harvest guidelines including the distribution between domestic and foreign fishing operations. The management
measures for 1994 are designed to keep landings within the harvest guidelines, for those species for which there are
harvest guidelines and to achieve the goals and objectives of the FMP and its implementing regulations. The intended
effect of these actions is to establish allowable harvest levels of Pacific coast groundfish and to implement management
measures designed to achieve but not exceed those harvest levels while extending fishing and processing opportunities
as long as possible during the year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMP requires that fishery specifications for groundfish be evaluated each calendar year, that harvest guidelines
or quotas be specified for species or species groups in need of additional protection, and that management measures
designed to achieve the harvest guidelines or quotas be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and implemented by January 1, the beginning of the next fishing year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final fishery specifications and management measures have been recommended by the Council and approved by
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for implementation on January 1, 1994. The ABCs and harvest guidelines announced
herein are the basis for the management measures recommended for 1994, and may be modified during the year as provided
in the FMP. Unless otherwise specified, all of the management measures announced in this notice are considered ``routine,''
and have been so designated at 50 CFR 663.23. The exception is trip limits in the open-access fisheries for groundfish
caught incidentally in nongroundfish gear (such as trawl gear used to fish for pink shrimp, spot or ridgeback prawns,
California halibut, or sea cucumbers). These trip limits will be designated ``routine'' in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice so that they may be adjusted as necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FMP provides for announcement of the final fishery specifications in the

 after consideration at two Council meetings. The process for adopting ABCs and harvest guidelines for 1994 was initiated
early in 1993 so that preliminary specifications could be adopted by the Council at its September 1993 meeting. New
stock assessments, the basis for changes to the 1993 ABCs, were distributed to the public prior to the September Council
meeting. The Council's scientific and industry advisory committees and the public reviewed and commented on the
documents. After receiving comments, the Council adopted preliminary ABCs and harvest guidelines at its September
meeting, which were subsequently made available to the public. Comments were requested before and at the November
Council meeting. The final recommendations of harvest specifications and management measures designed to achieve
those specifications, adopted at the November Council meeting, were forwarded to the Secretary for implementation
by January 1, 1994.

Open-Access and Limited-Entry Allocations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fishery specifications include ABCs, the designation of harvest guidelines or quotas for species that need individual
management, the apportionment of the harvest guidelines or quotas between domestic and foreign fisheries, and subsequent
allocation between the open-access and limited-entry segments of the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final 1994 specifications (except for DAP, DAH, JVP, and TALFF) are listed in Table 1, followed by a discussion
of each specification that differs from 1993 levels. As in the past, these specifications include fish caught in state
ocean waters (0&hyph;3 nautical miles offshore) as well as fish caught in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (3&hyph;200
nautical miles offshore).

The yellowtail rockfish assessment addresses three separate areas: Vancouver, Columbia north of Cape Lookout,
and Columbia south of Cape Lookout plus Eureka. For this table, the Columbia ABC means north Columbia only, and the
Eureka ABC means Eureka plus south Columbia. The total ABC for yellowtail rockfish is divided into two harvest guidelines:
4,160 mt for the northern area (Vancouver plus Columbia north of Cape Lookout) and 2,580 mt for the southern area (Eureka
plus Columbia area south of Cape Lookout). (Separate harvest guidelines are established for the Sebastes complex
north and south of the Eureka-Columbia border. Therefore, 300 mt of the yellowtail rockfish southern harvest guideline
is included in the southern Sebastes complex harvest guideline, and the remainder of the yellowtail rockfish southern
harvest guideline is included in the northern Sebastes complex harvest guideline.) A 16 percent discard factor will
be added to certain landings of yellowtail rockfish inseason. This will affect inseason landings estimates for the
Sebastes complex also.

Changes to the ABCs and Harvest Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 final ABCs are changed from the 1993 levels for the following species: Pacific whiting, shortbelly rockfish,
widow rockfish, chilipepper, yellowtail rockfish, remaining rockfish, English sole, and petrale sole. These changes
are based on the best available scientific information. Information considered in determining the ABCs is available
from the Council (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and was distributed to the public in the Council's stock assessment and fishery evaluation (SAFE) document. The
SAFE document, required under the guidelines for Fishery Management Plans at 50 CFR part 602, summarizes the best
available scientific information concerning the past, present, and possible future condition of the stocks and
fisheries being managed under Federal regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those species or species groups with harvest guidelines in 1993 will continue to be managed with harvest guidelines
in 1994. As in 1993, no quotas are established. The harvest guidelines are changed from those for 1993 for Pacific whiting,
jack mackerel, Pacific ocean perch (POP), shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, thornyheads, yellowtail rockfish,
the

 complex in the Vancouver/Columbia subareas, Dover sole in the Columbia subarea and coastwide, and new harvest guidelines

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 complex in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the ABCs and harvest guidelines are described below. All other ABC and annual harvest guideline specifications
announced in Tables 1 and 2 for 1993 (58 FR 2990, January 7, 1993) will apply again in 1994 and are included in Table 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lingcod.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ABC for lingcod remains at 7,000 mt, but a new harvest guideline is established at 4,000 mt in 1994, approximating
peak landings during the past 10 years. Landings ranged between 3,000 and 3,500 mt in 1989&hyph;1991. The ABC is based
on historical landings rather than a scientific stock assessment, and has not been updated since 1986. A stock assessment
for lingcod is planned for the near future. The Council was concerned that the new open-access fishery would expand
its lingcod harvest. In order to discourage expansion pending completion of the new stock assessment, a harvest guideline
was designated. Based on the harvest guideline, open-access and limited-entry allocations are being specified.
If effort shifts into this fishery, trip limits may be imposed to keep landings within the allocations and/or harvest
guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pacific whiting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ABC for Pacific whiting in 1994 (325,000 mt for the United States (U.S.) and Canada combined) is substantially
higher than in 1993 (177,000 mt) for several reasons. The 1992 hydroacoustic survey utilized new, more sensitive
equipment, and extended further offshore and further north to better encompass the range of pacific whiting. As a
result, the biomass estimate was more than double the previous estimate. In recent years, the Council has adopted
a hybrid fishing strategy that combines the features of a constant fishing mortality (F) strategy at higher levels
of biomass, and, at lower levels of biomass, a variable F strategy where fishing mortality for a particular year in
proportional to the level of female spawning biomass. If this moderate harvest policy is applied to the new projected
numbers in 1994, the potential yield would be 450,000 mt. However, the Council recommended a more conservative harvest
rate for 1994, which provides a yield of 325,000 mt, to provide for cautious exploitation until further information
can be obtained; the large increase in projected yield is due to a single survey estimate that will not be replicated
until 1995. In addition, the Council felt it prudent to acknowledge the possibility of a combined U.S. and Canadian
harvest in excess of the U.S.-Canada ABC as occurred in 1992 and 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These overages (15 percent in 1993) have not caused a biological problem, particularly given the large increase in
the ABC in 1994. The Council recommended that the U.S. share in 1994 continue at 80 percent of the U.S.-Canada ABC, as
was the case in 1993, providing a U.S. harvest guideline of 260,000 mt. If Canada continues to calculate its share in
the same manner as in 1992 and 1993, the U.S. and Canadian total harvest would be 14 percent above the coastwide ABC in
1994. However, the total harvest would be lower than the overfishing level, and lower than the amount that would have
been taken if the Council had chosen to use the moderate harvest rate level, as in 1993, in determining the ABC. If recruitment
remains near the median level, a decline in annual yield is expected over the next few years, and will be slightly more
severe if the catch exceeds the harvest guideline. Bilateral negotiations with Canada are expected to continue to
resolve this issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Jack mackerel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ABC is maintained at 52,600 mt, the same level as in 1993, and the harvest guideline is adjusted upward to equal the
ABC. In 1992, the harvest guideline has been set at 46,500 mt, lower than the ABC, to deduct the amount of jack mackerel
that was expected to be taken beyond 200 nautical miles (nm). However, the fishery did not materialize and the Council
recommended setting the harvest guideline equal to ABC in 1993. This change inadvertently was not announced with
the 1993 specifications in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Chilipepper rockfish

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In 1993, the coastwide ABC was set at 3,600 mt with nearly all the catch coming from the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception
subareas. The catch in 1992 was about 2,895 mt; 1993 landings data are not yet available for this species. A new assessment
indicates that the ABC could be higher, up to 5,000 mt, due to a very strong 1984 year class, and that the stock is at a level
above that expected under the recommended level of exploitation. However, the Council recommended a lower ABC of
4,000 mt for 1994, higher than the expected 1993 catch, but less than the maximum amount suggested by the assessment
and close to the long-term average yield. Although a higher ABC appears supportable from the assessment, it is not
recommended because bocaccio, which is at a low stock level and has an ABC of 1,540 mt and 1993 landings near that level,
are unavoidably caught with chilipepper. There is no harvest guideline at this time for chilipepper rockfish.

Pacific ocean perch (POP)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on the 1992 stock assessment, the ABC for POP remains at zero. A rebuilding program was established for POP in
1981, following depletion of this stock during the 1960's and early 1970's. Significant rebuilding has not been detected.
The stock abundance is estimated to be about 50 percent of its target level and recent harvests of about 1,000 mt are
near the level of overfishing. If the stock recovers to its target level, then annual yields of about 1,400 mt may be
possible. Strong year classes which are necessary to rebuild the stock occur infrequently, so the lack of rebuilding
is not unexpected. The harvest guideline continues to be set at the level that accommodates the incidental catch of
POP caught while fishing for other species. The reduction of the harvest guideline from 1,550 mt in 1993 to 1,300 mt
in 1994 results from converting the harvest guideline from an estimate of total catch (retention plus discards) to
an estimate of landed catch (retention only). The harvest guideline of 1,550 mt in 1993 applied to the total catch,
1,300 mt for landed catch and a 250-mt (16 percent) estimate of trip-limit induced discards. In 1994, the harvest guideline
represents only the landed catch, and therefore is lowered to 1,300 mt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the last several years, the harvest guideline, in conjunction with a very small trip limit, was necessary to accommodate
only incidental catches of POP which otherwise would have been discarded. The trip limit will not be relaxed to achieve
the harvest guideline, but may be changed to reflect revised estimates of bycatch levels. The catch in 1993 is projected
to be about 1,447 mt, 93 percent of the harvest guideline. The 1994 harvest guideline is consistent with the Council's
policy to allow for incidental catches during the 20-year rebuilding schedule for POP.

Shortbelly rockfish
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Shortbelly rockfish remains an unexploited stock and thus is difficult to assess quantitatively. In recent years,
the ABC has been maintained at 13,000 mt until further data can be collected. However, the midpoint of the range of recently
revised yield estimates is 23,500 mt. The Council agreed that this represents the best available scientific information
and recommended that the harvest guideline be set equal to the ABC. To date, a fishery for this species has not developed.
Less than 10 mt were taken in 1992 and similar landings have occurred in 1993.

Widow rockfish.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A new assessment was conducted for widow rockfish which explored the consequences of near-term landings between
5,000&hyph;7,000 mt. If recent recruitment remains near the average, then stock abundance is expected to remain
nearly constant with annual landings of 7,000 mt (which would, including discards, indicate a total harvest of 8,150
mt) in 1994&hyph;1996. With annual harvest at 6,500 mt, stock abundance would be expected to increase slightly towards
its target level. However, the assessment also provides a plausible alternative, based on lower stock abundance
and recent recruitment at a lower, median level, which would support landings of only 5,000 mt during 1994&hyph;1996.
Given this uncertainty, the ABC and HG are both set at 6,500 mt for 1994.

Thornyheads.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ABCs for shortspine and longspine thornyheads are the same as in 1993. The two species of thornyhead cannot be practically
separated in the landings, so, as in 1993, the 1994 harvest guideline is set for the combined species. However, like
POP, the harvest guideline is adjusted so that it applies only to landed catch in 1994. Under the assumption that equal
amounts of each species will be in the catch, the harvest guideline is set at 6,440 mt for both species combined (the
1993 harvest guideline of 7,000 mt, which represented the total catch, minus 8 percent for trip limit induced discards).
This would result in a shortspine thornyhead catch equal to its overfishing level of 3,500 mt and a longspine catch
that is less than its ABC of 10,100 mt. However, the percentage of shortspine thornyheads in 1991 and 1992 has been lower
than 50 percent, and therefore the catches in these years have been below the overfishing level. During the first half
of 1993, shortspine contributed only 35 percent of the thornyhead landings. If the percentage shortspine in 1994
remains at this reduced level as expected, the 1994 catch would be 2,450 mt, well below the overfishing level.

Yellowtail rockfish.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A new stock assessment was conducted which indicates that 1983 and 1984 were stronger year classes than previously
thought. The ABCs which were applied to the Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka subareas separately in the past, are applied
to different subareas in 1994, coinciding with the subareas used in the new stock assessment. These areas are: The
Eureka subarea combined with the Columbia subarea south of Cape Falcon (40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; to 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;46
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude); the Columbia subarea north of Cape Falcon (45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;46
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; to 47
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude); and the Vancouver subarea between 47
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; and 49
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude which includes Canadian waters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the north Columbia subarea, the assessment indicates a stock that is slowly declining, and further declines are
expected as the 1983&hyph;1984 year class moves through the stock. The 1994 4,160 mt ABC in this area is higher than
the 1992 catch and similar to average catches between 1986&hyph;1989. In the Vancouver subarea, which extends into
Canadian waters, there are contrary indicators of stock condition. Trawl survey data indicate a stable healthy stock
from 1980&hyph;1992, whereas age composition data do not indicate a particularly strong 1983&hyph;1984 year class
and implies a steeply declining stock. Therefore the ABC for the Vancouver subarea is more conservative, based on
the lower end of the optimistic scenario in the stock assessment, and the U.S. portion is estimated at 60 percent, or
1,190 mt. In the southern subareas (Eureka/south Columbia), the stock is believed to have recently increased because
of the strong 1983&hyph;1984 year classes, but will experience a declining trend as the strong year classes are exploited.
In 1993, 300 mt of the ABC was set aside for the Eureka subarea, and a harvest guideline, equal to the sum of the ABCs, was
set only for the U.S. Vancouver/Columbia subareas combined. In 1994, however, two harvest guidelines are set for
yellowtail rockfish, dividing the U.S. Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka subareas at Cape Falcon, Oregon. The 4,160
mt harvest guideline in the northern subareas (U.S. Vancouver/north Columbia) is the sum of the ABCs. In the southern
area (south Columbia/Eureka), the harvest guideline is set equal to the ABC of 2,580 mt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Remaining rockfish in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas includes all rockfish except POP, widow rockfish,
shortbelly rockfish, bocaccio and chilipepper rockfish. The ABCs for remaining rockfish have been unchanged since
1983. The ABCs in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas were set at 1.2 times the 1977 catch, for a total of 9,500
mt. During 1983&hyph;1992, the catch of remaining rockfish in this area has ranged from 5,100 mt to 7,200 mt with an
average of 6,600 mt. Although annual catches never have achieved the 9,500 mt ABC, an examination of declines in average
length for several rockfish species suggests that the fishery is having a noticeable impact. Although there is insufficient
information to conduct a quantitative stock assessment for the remaining rockfish in this southern area, an increase
in effort in this area should not be encouraged, and therefore the ABC is reduced to 7,000 mt, the upper range of harvest
in recent years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remaining rockfish in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas are defined as all rockfish except POP, yellowtail rockfish,
canary rockfish, widow rockfish, and shortbelly rockfish. The ABC is not changed in 1994.

guideline to better respond to effort shifts during the season.

Dover sole.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no change to any of the subarea or coastwide ABCs for Dover sole. At its November 1992 meeting, to mitigate the
economic impact of abrupt reductions in ABC, the Council adopted a policy to reduce the harvest (and therefore the
harvest guideline) in the Columbia subarea by 1,000 mt annually until the 4,000 mt ABC for that subarea is reached in
1995. This is the second year of the step-down, and therefore the harvest guideline in the Columbia subarea is reduced
from 6,000 mt in 1993 to 5,000 mt in 1994, 1,000 mt above the 1994 ABC. Consequently, the coastwide harvest guideline,
which is the sum of the subarea harvest guidelines, is 16,900 mt, 1,000 mt higher than the sum of the ABCs. As stated at
58 FR 2994 (January 7, 1993), the risk of overfishing Dover sole in the Columbia subarea is not appreciably increased
by setting the harvest guideline greater than the ABC in 1993 and 1994. The Columbia subarea catch has declined from
an average of 7,970 mt in 1988&hyph;1991 to 5,665 mt in 1992, and landings are expected to be about 5,800 mt in 1993.

English sole. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The coastwide ABC of 1,900 mt in 1993 is changed to two area ABCs in 1994: 2,000 mt for the Vancouver-Columbia area and
1,100 mt for the Eureka-Monterey-Conception area. A new stock assessment was conducted only for the Vancouver-Columbia
area. It indicated high recruitment during 1977&hyph;1992. The large biomass, combined with the early age at maturity
which allows a high exploitation rate, suggest that a ten-fold increase in short-term yield may be possible in the
Vancouver-Columbia area. However, catches have averaged only about 2,100 mt between 1983&hyph;1991. The 1994 ABC
is set conservatively, at 2,000 mt in this area, approximately double the coastwide average catch during 1983&hyph;1991.
The southern area ABC is set near the recent average catch because trawl surveys indicate little trend in abundance.
There is no harvest guideline for English sole.

A new stock assessment for the Vancouver and Columbia subareas was conducted which resulted in the ABC for the two subareas
being combined and lowered from 1,700 mt in 1993 to 1,200 mt in 1994. The assessment indicates that the stock in this
area is essentially at the expected long-term average level of abundance, and recent yields are slightly below the
potential. In addition, the ABC is lowered to exclude the portion that applied to Canadian waters that mistakenly
was included in the previous ABC. There is no harvest guideline for petrale sole.

Setting Harvest Guidelines Greater Than ABC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most cases, harvest guidelines equal the ABCs, or prorated ABCs, for specific areas. However, for 1994 as in 1993,
the Council recommended harvest guidelines that exceed the ABCs for three species, POP, Dover sole in the Columbia
subarea, and shortspine thornyheads. The FMP requires that the Council consider certain factors when setting a harvest
guideline above an ABC. These factors were analyzed by the Council's Groundfish Management Team (GMT) and considered
at the Council's November 1993 meeting before recommending the 1994 harvest guidelines. These factors also were
considered in establishing the 20-year rebuilding schedule for POP in the 1981 FMP, and in the most recent stock assessments
for POP and Dover sole in the Council's August 1992 SAFE document, which provided the basis for the 1993 and 1994 ABCs.
A synopsis of these issues appears in the above discussion of these species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Overfishing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMP defines ``overfishing'' as a fishing mortality rate that would, in the long-term, reduce the spawning biomass
per recruit below 20 percent of what it would have been if the stock had never been exploited (unless the species is above
the level that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY)). The rate is defined in terms of the percentage of
the stock removed per year. Therefore, a large amount of catch can cause overfishing at any stock abundance level.
Conversely, overfishing does not necessarily occur for stocks at low abundance levels if the catch can be kept to a
sufficiently small fraction of that stock level. The target rate of exploitation for west coast groundfish typically
is the rate that would reduce spawning biomass per recruit to 35 percent of its unfished level. This desired rate of
fishing will always be less than the overfishing rate, so there is a buffer between the management target and the level
that could harm the stock's long-term potential productivity. If the overfishing level is reached, the Guidelines
for Fishery Management Plans at 50 CFR part 602 require the Council to identify actions to be undertaken to alleviate
overfishing. POP is the only species believed to be near its overfishing level in 1993, and no others are expected to
be overfished in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POP was depleted off Washington and Oregon mainly by foreign fishing during the 1960's and early 1970's. In 1981, a
rebuilding program was established for POP in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas. (POP are neither common nor important
in the more southern areas). A review in 1992 of fishery and survey data does not indicate any significant rebuilding.
The stock is estimated to be about 50 percent of its MSY level and recent harvests are near the level of overfishing (1,100
mt). The review also indicates that strong year classes, which are necessary to rebuild the stock, occur infrequently
so the lack of rebuilding is not expected. The Council's GMT recognized that, as long as trawling occurs in these areas,
incidental catches of POP will result. The GMT recommended that trip limits continue to be set to discourage targeting
on POP while allowing landings of incidental catches.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not anticipated that lowering the level of the trip limit (or the harvest guideline) will reduce the fishing mortality
of POP. The level of catch will vary with effort in the Vancouver-Columbia area, and it is possible that the overfishing
level will be reached, but not substantially exceeded, in 1994. Under the same harvest guideline and trip limit (3,000
pounds (1,361 kg) or 20 percent of all groundfish per trip, whichever is less), the total landings were 1,378 mt in 1991,
1,023 mt in 1992, and are projected at 1,214 mt in 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Stock assessments and inseason catch monitoring are designed to account for all fishing mortality, including that
resulting from fish discarded at sea. Discards of rockfish and sablefish in the fishery for whiting processed at sea
are well-monitored and are accounted for inseason as they occur. In the other fisheries, discards caused by trip limits
are not monitored, so discard factors have been developed to reasonably account for this extra catch. These discard
factors are applied in several ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases (trawl sablefish, widow rockfish, bocaccio, Dover sole), the discard factor was used in the stock assessment
and in the setting of the ABC. Therefore the ABC and harvest guideline are defined in terms of landed catch. No additional
discard factor is applied to inseason catch projections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other cases (yellowtail rockfish, POP, thornyheads), a discard factor was not anticipated in the stock assessment
leading to the setting of the ABC because the assessment was conducted before the trip limits became low enough to induce
discards. For POP and thornyheads, an estimate of discards caused by trip limits has been subtracted from the ABC so
that the harvest guideline represents only the landed catch. For yellowtail rockfish, a variety of gears with different
discard levels contribute to the catch, so the harvest guideline is set equal to ABC and landings are adjusted by a discard
factor during the season to estimate total removals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of trip limit discard is not monitored. A level previously measured for widow rockfish (16 percent) in a scientific
study is assumed to be appropriate for the commercial fisheries for widow rockfish, yellowtail rockfish and POP.
A lower level of 8 percent is used for the deepwater thornyhead fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discarded bycatch in the Pacific whiting fishery always is counted towards the harvest guideline inseason because
this source of discard is measured accurately by observers and is variable from year to year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foreign and domestic fisheries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For those species needing individual management that will not be fully utilized by domestic processors or harvesters,
and that can be caught without severely impacting species that are fully utilized by domestic processors or harvesters,
the harvest guidelines or quotas may be apportioned to domestic annual harvest (DAH, which includes domestic annual
processing (DAP) and joint venture processing (JVP)) and the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). In
1994, there are no surplus groundfish available for joint venture or foreign fishing operations. Consequently,
all the harvest guidelines in 1994 are designated entirely for DAP (which also equals DAH), and JVP and TALFF are set
at zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the unlikely event that a foreign or joint venture fishery should occur, the incidental catch levels would be the
same as announced at Table 2, footnote 1 of 58 FR 2990 (January 7, 1993).

The Limited-Entry Program_Effective January 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 6 to the FMP establishes a limited-entry program which divides the groundfish fishery into two components,
the limited-entry fishery and the open-access fishery, each of which has its own allocations and management measures.
The limited-entry and open-access allocations are calculated according to a formula specified in the FMP and implementing
regulations, and are announced annually with the ABC and harvest guideline specifications. At its November 1993
meeting, the Council recommended the species and areas subject to open-access and limited-entry allocations in
1994, and the Regional Director calculated the amounts of the allocations which are presented in Table 1. Unless otherwise
specified, the limited-entry and open-access allocations are treated as harvest guidelines in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Open-access allocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The open-access fishery means the fishery composed of vessels using (i) exempt gear, or (ii) longline or pot (trap)
gear used pursuant to the harvest guidelines, quotas, and other management measures governing the open-access fishery.
Exempt gear means all types of fishing gear except groundfish trawl, longline, and pots. (Exempt gear includes trawls
used to harvest pink shrimp or spot or ridgeback prawns (shrimp trawls), and, south of Point Arena, California, California
halibut, or sea cucumbers.) Simply put, open-access gear is all types of fishing gear except longline, pot, or groundfish
trawl gear fished by a vessel that has a limited-entry permit affixed with a gear endorsement for that gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open-access allocation is derived by applying the open-access allocation percentage to the annual harvest guideline
or quota after subtracting any set asides for recreational fishing or treaty Indians under sections II.E. (b) and
(c) of the Appendix to part 663. For those species in which the open-access share would have been less than one percent,
no open-access allocation is specified for 1994 because significant open-access effort is not anticipated. At the
time the calculations were made, the status of some vessels (whether or not they would receive a limited-entry permit)
was not certain. The catch by these vessels was divided equally between the limited-entry and open-access allocations.
The highest ``undecided'' amount is 4.7 percent for the catch of species used to represent bocaccio during the window
period. Therefore the greatest potential error in any of the open-access or limited-entry allocations is less than
2.5 percent of the harvest guideline. This level of error would not result in a change in any of the trip limits for the
limited-entry or open-access fisheries.

Limited-entry allocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The limited-entry fishery means the fishery composed of vessels using limited-entry gear fished pursuant to the
harvest guidelines, quotas, and other management measures governing the limited-entry fishery. Limited-entry
gear means longline, pot, or groundfish trawl gear used under the authority of a valid limited-entry permit, issued
under 50 CFR part 663, affixed with an endorsement for that gear. (Groundfish trawl gear excludes shrimp trawls used
to harvest pink shrimp, spot prawns, or ridgeback prawns, and other trawls used to fish for California halibut or sea
cucumbers south of Pt. Arena, California.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limited-entry allocation is the allowable catch (harvest guideline or quota) reduced by: (1) Set asides, if any,
for treaty Indian fisheries or recreational fisheries, and (2) the open-access allocation.

II. 1994 Management Measures_Commercial Fishery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the 1994 management measures announced in this notice have been designated as ``routine'' under the procedures
contained in Amendment 4 to the FMP (56 FR 736, January 8, 1991). The ``routine'' designation means that a measure is
likely to need adjustment on an annual or more frequent basis, and that it may be implemented and adjusted for a specified
species or species group and gear type after consideration at a single Council meeting. However, the effects of the
particularly measure must have been analyzed previously, the purpose of the measure must be the same as when it was
designated as routine, and the measure must be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those management measures not yet designated as routine apply to the harvest of groundfish taken incidentally in
non-groundfish fisheries (in the open-access fishery) for pink shrimp, spot and ridgeback prawns, California halibut,
and sea cucumbers. These fisheries must be managed under ``routine'' trip limits to assure that open-access allocations
are not exceeded. The trip limits for pink shrimp, and spot and ridgeback prawns previously were codified at 50 CFR
663.24; those for California halibut and sea cucumbers are announced herein for the first time. In the future, the
Council also may recommend designating trip limits for lingcod as routine, so that they may be adjusted in season to
achieve its harvest guideline which was specified for the first time in 1994.

Limited-entry fishery. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following management measures apply to vessels operating in the limited-entry fishery after January 1, 1994,
and are designed to keep landings within the harvest guidelines or limited-entry allocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Sebastes complex (including yellowtail rockfish and Bocaccio). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning January 1, 1993, the cumulative trip limit for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex coastwide was 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) in a 2-week period, of which no more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) could
be bocaccio taken south of Cape Mendocino, or 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) could be yellowtail rockfish caught north of
Coos Bay, Oregon. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex trip limit remained the same all year, but the trip limit for yellowtail rockfish was lowered to 6,000 pounds
(2,722 kg) in late April, and the bacaccio trip limit was increased to 15,000 pounds (6,804 kg) in early October. By
the end of 1993, landings of bocaccio are yellowtail rockfish and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex catches are expected to exceed their harvest guideline in the Vancouver/Columbia subareas by as much as 27
percent and 18 percent, respectively. The Council did not recommend further reductions in the trip limit for yellowtail
rockfish in 1993 because the ABC and harvest guideline for this species were expected to increase substantially in
1994, and the overage in 1993 is not expected to reduce future productivity. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex harvest guideline was exceeded entirely due to the overage in the yellowtail rockfish landings, so the trip
limit for the complex was not reduced for the same reasons as for yellowtail rockfish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1994, the cumulative trip limit period for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex (including yellowtail rockfish and bocaccio) is extended from 2 weeks to a calendar month, consistent with
the period for widow rockfish and the Dover sole/thornyhead/sablefish complex. However, the trip limit is not simply
doubled because experience has shown that the opportunity for landings, and thus catch rates, increase as the trip
limit period is lengthened. Consequently, the coastwide trip limit for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex is increased to only 80,000 pounds (36,290 kg) per calendar month in 1994. Analysis of 1993 Washington and
Oregon landings accumulated by 4-week periods indicated that this trip limit will not be severely constraining because
few cumulative 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
trips exceeded 80,000 pounds (36,290 kg) in 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the management line for yellowtail rockfish is moved north to Cape Lookout, Oregon (45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;20
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;15
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude), to better define the areas where this species is concentrated. The cumulative trip limit for
yellowtail rockfish north of Cape Lookout is set at 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) per month, intermediate to the 1993 levels
(6,000 pounds (2,722 kg) and 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) per 2-week periods), because landings in 1993 are believed to
have been similar to the 1994 harvest guideline for the same area. To keep landings from accelerating south of the line,
as occurred in 1992, a trip limit of 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) per month is established for yellowtail rockfish caught
south of Cape Lookout.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because landings of bocaccio did not reach the 1993 harvest guideline, the trip limit is almost doubled to 30,000 pounds
(13,608 kg) per month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 restrictions limited a vessel to the northern, more restrictive trip limit for yellowtail rockfish if operating
on both sides of the line at Coos Bay. This was a problem for vessels that took the yellowtail rockfish limit south of
Coos Bay at the beginning of the month, and then fished north of the line for the DTS complex because yellowtail rockfish
is commonly taken as bycatch. The yellowtail rockfish would either need to be discarded or the vessel would be in violation
of the more restrictive northern limit. The same problem would exist north and south of Cape Lookout in 1994. Consequently,
the Council endorsed a declaration procedure by the States of Oregon and Washington that would allow a fisherman to
operate both north and south of Cape Lookout during a month and retain up to the southern limit of yellowtail rockfish,
if the State is notified in advance where the vessel will be operating on each trip that crosses the line during that
month. These declarations, which are binding for the trip, are similar, but not identical, to those used in the past.
The State where the fish will be landed (Oregon or Washington) should be contacted for more complete information on
these procedures, which may differ between the two States. The phone numbers of the State agencies appear in Section
III.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Widow rockfish. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 cumulative trip limit for widow rockfish initially was set at 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) per 4-week period,
but was reduced to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) per trip on December 1, 1993. Landings of widow rockfish are projected to
exceed the harvest guideline by as much as 12 percent in 1993. For 1994, the trip limit is again initially set at 30,000
pounds (13,608 kg), but the period is slightly extended from 4-weeks to a calendar month. Reducing the number of trip
limit periods from 13 4-week periods (of 28 days) to 12 calendar months (of 30&hyph;31 days) is intended to reduce landings
from 1993 levels and avoid the need for further trip limit reductions before the fall of 1994.

POP. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 trip limit for POP is the same as in 1991&hyph;1993: 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) or 20 percent of all fish on board,
whichever is less, in landings of POP above 1,000 pounds (454 kg). This is not a cumulative limit because it is intended
to accommodate only incidental catches. It therefore applies to each fishing trip. Because the trip limit for POP
is intended to accommodate only unavoidable incidental catches, it will not be increased if landings are lower than
the harvest guideline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DTS complex (Dover sole, thornyheads, and trawl-caught sablefish). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In January 1993, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex was 45,000 pounds (20,412 kg) per 2-week period, of which
no more than 20,000 pounds (9,072 kg) could be thornyheads and no more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg), or 25 percent of the
DTS complex, whichever was greater, could be sablefish. In April, the trip limits were reduced and applied on a 4-week
cumulative basis: 60,000 pounds (27,216 kg) of the DTS complex, of which no more than 35,000 pounds (15,876 kg) could
be thornyheads. The sablefish trip limit remained the same (but was expected to result in lower landings due to the
reduction in the trip limit for the complex) until September when a ceiling of 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) per trip was added.
Nonetheless, landings continued at high levels and, at the Council's November 1993 meeting, were projected to exceed
the harvest guidelines for trawl-caught sablefish by 18 percent and for thornyheads by 17 percent. Dover sole landings
were projected to be 17 percent below its coastwide harvest guideline, but only 3 percent below the harvest guideline
in the Columbia subarea (which is 1,000 mt lower in 1994). Further reductions were implemented in December 1993 (58
FR 64169, December 6, 1993) but were not expected to substantially reduce these overages. Throughout the year, no
more than 5,000 pound (2,268 kg) of sablefish per trip could be smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1994, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex is 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) per month, including no more than
30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) of thornyheads and 12,000 pounds (5,443 kg) of trawl-caught sablefish. The cumulative
period is lengthened from 4-weeks to calendar month. The sablefish trip limit of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) or 25 percent
of the DTS complex, whichever is greater, that applies to each trip, remains in effect. The 5,000-pound (2,268 kg)
trip limit on sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) also continues. Even though the sablefish harvest guideline
applies only to the Vancouver, Columbia, Eureka, and Monterey areas, these trip limits are applied coastwide to avoid
effort shifts into the Conception area.

Nontrawl trip limits for sablefish. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, a coastwide 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit was applied until May 9, the beginning of the 72-hour closure
before the start of the regular season on May 12. The 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit was reimposed on June 5 following
a 72-hour closure beginning June 2. Landings are projected to be within one percent of the harvest guideline in 1993.
The harvest guideline applies coastwide except for the Conception subarea.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daily trip limits are established again in 1994, until 72 hours before, and 72 hours after, the regular season which
is scheduled to start on May 15, 1994. However, the 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit will apply only to the Vancouver,
Columbia, Eureka, and Monterey subareas, the same areas covered by the harvest guideline. In the Conception area,
where there is no harvest guideline and landings have been below the 425 mt ABC, the daily trip limit is increased to
350 pounds (159 kg). This limit will accommodate most current landings without encouraging excessive effort shifts
into that area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trip limit for sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (1,500 pounds (680 kg) or 3 percent of all legal sablefish
on board, whichever is greater) remains in effect.

and after the regular season. In 1994, the regular season begins on March 1 between 42

Open-access fishery. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its November meeting, the Council recommended open-access fishery trip limits for certain gear types, areas,
and species or species groups. For all open-access gear except trawls, the Council recommended: (1) A 10,000 pound
(4,536 kg) trip limit for all rockfish, not to exceed 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative in a month; and (2) a sablefish
trip limit of the same amounts and areas as for the limited-entry nontrawl fishery at the beginning of the year (250
pounds (113 kg) per day north of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude; 350 pounds (159 kg) per day south of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude). For shrimp trawls, the trip limit for spot and ridgeback prawns remains the same at 1,000 pounds
(454 kg) of groundfish per trip, and the trip limit in the pink shrimp fishery (1,500 pounds (680 kg) of groundfish per
day times the number of days in the fishing trip) is the same except the exclusion of whiting, shortbelly rockfish,
and arrowtooth flounder is removed. The trip limits all are designed to keep landings within the open-access allocation
for as long as possible during the year. In addition, any more restrictive limits imposed on the limited-entry vessels
also apply to the open-access vessels. In particular, the cumulative monthly limits for bocaccio and for yellowtail
rockfish are more restrictive than the 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative limit on all rockfish in the open-access
fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment resulting from the discussion of trip limits at the September 1993 Council meeting revealed two minor
trawl fisheries for non-groundfish species (California halibut and sea cucumbers south of Point Arena, California)
that incidentally take small amounts of groundfish. If these vessels had landed the 500-pound (227 kg) minimum landing
requirement during the window period, they would have qualified for a limited-entry permit, but they did not. These
vessels are considered to be using exempt gears, and therefore may participate in the open-access fishery. The Council
agreed that the total take of groundfish in these fisheries was insignificant, if measurable, and that there was no
need to force these fishers to discard incidentally-caught groundfish. Therefore, a 500-pound (227 kg) trip limit
for all groundfish species was recommended for these fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vessels using open-access gear are subject to the management measures for the open-access fishery, whether or not
the vessel has a valid limited-entry permit endorsed for any other gear. In addition, a vessel operating in the open-access
fishery must not exceed any trip limit, frequency limit, and/or size limit for the same gear and/or subarea in the limited-entry
fishery (as announced in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice in paragraphs titled ``limited-entry''). A vessel that operates in both the open-access and limited-entry
fisheries is not entitled to two separate trip limits for the same species. Fish caught with open-access gear will
also be counted toward the limited-entry trip limit. For example; In one month, a trawl vessel catches 12,000 pounds
(5,443 kg) of yellowtail rockfish in the limited-entry fishery, and in the same month catches 4,000 pounds (1,814
kg) of yellowtail rockfish using hook-and-line (open-access) gear. Because the open-access landings are counted
toward the limited-entry limit, the vessel would have exceeded its monthly 14,000 pound (6,350 kg) limited-entry
limit for yellowtail rockfish by 2,000 pounds (907 kg).

III. 1994 Management Measures_Recreational Fishery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recreational size and bag limits in 1994 are the same as in 1993 except for the bag limit for black rockfish off Oregon.
The State of Oregon is concerned that numbers of black rockfish on the north Oregon coast are declining and has reduced
the State bag limit from 15 rockfish of any species, to 15 rockfish of which no more than 10 may be black rockfish. The
Council recommended that the same change be made to the bag limit in Federal waters to conserve the species and maintain
consistency with Oregon regulations. The commercial fishery is not restricted at this time because the commercial
catch of black rockfish is low, and commercial vessels have voluntarily agreed to avoid the nearshore areas where
black rockfish are found.

IV. Secretarial Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated above, the Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendations and announces the following
management actions for 1994, including those that have not been changed since 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Definitions and Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following definitions and provisions apply to the 1994 management measures, unless otherwise specified in a
subsequent notice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A trip limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex, by weight, or by percentage of fish on board,
that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel from a single fishing trip.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A daily trip limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in 24 consecutive hours, starting
at 0001 hours local time. Only one landing of groundfish may be made in that 24-hour period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A cumulative trip limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, without
a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 initially apply to calendar months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Unless the fishery is closed, a vessel which has landed its cumulative or daily limit may continue to fish on the
limit for the next legal period so long as the fish are not landed (offloaded) until the next legal period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All weights are round weights or round weight equivalents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Percentages are based on round weights, and, unless otherwise specified, apply only to legal fish on board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Legal fish means fish taken and retained, possessed, or landed in accordance with the provisions of 50 CFR part
663, the Magnuson Act, any notice issued under subpart B of part 663, and any other regulation promulgated or permit
issued under the Magnuson Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Closure, when referring to closure of a fishery, means that taking and retaining, possessing or landing the particular
species or species group is prohibited. (See the regulations at 50 CFR 663.2.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The fishery management area for these species is the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California between
3 and 200 nautical miles offshore, and bounded on the north by the Provisional International Boundary between the
United States and Canada, and bounded on the south by the International Boundary between the United States and Mexico.
All groundfish possessed 0&hyph;200 nautical miles offshore, or landed in, Washington, Oregon, or California are
presumed to have been taken and retained from the fishery management area, unless otherwise demonstrated by the person
in possession of those fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Inseason changes to trip limits are announced by notices published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information concerning changes to trip limits also is available from the NMFS Northwest and Southwest regional offices

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES

 above]. Changes to trip limits are effective at the times stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices. Once a change is effective, it is illegal to take and retain, possess, or land more fish than allowed under
the new trip limit.

(11) It is unlawful for any person to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish in excess of the landing limit for
the open-access fishery without having a valid limited-entry permit for the vessel affixed with a gear endorsement
for the gear used to catch the fish. (50 CFR 663.7(t))

The States of Oregon and Washington are implementing declaration procedures that enable a vessel that fishes or transits
both north and south of Cape Lookout during a month to retain the 30,000 pound (13,608 kg) cumulative limit for yellowtail
rockfish south of Cape Lookout. For any vessel that takes and retains or lands yellowtail rockfish during the month,
a declaration must be filed for each fishing trip that crosses the line at Cape Lookout during that month, must be made
before leaving port on the fishing trip, and may not be changed once the vessel has left port. Declarations must be made,
according to State law, to the state where the fish will be landed. To make a declaration or for further information,
contact: Washington Department of Fisheries, Montesano, WA, at 206&hyph;249&hyph;4628; or Oregon Department
of Fish and Wildlife, Newport, OR, at 503&hyph;867&hyph;4741.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A vessel under a northern trip declaration may not exceed the northern limit during a single trip, nor may the cumulative
catch of all northern declared trips exceed the northern cumulative limit. The total cumulative catch for the month
may not exceed the southern limit, no matter where the fish are caught.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A vessel under a southern trip declaration may not fish for any groundfish north of Cape Lookout during the fishing
trip for which the declaration is made; otherwise, the northern trip limit would apply. A vessel under a southern trip
declaration may not exceed the southern trip limit during a single trip, nor may the cumulative catch of all southern
declared trips exceed the southern cumulative limit. The total cumulative catch for the month may not exceed the southern
limit, no matter where the fish are caught.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If any vessel is used to fish south of Cape Mendocino during the month, then the vessel is subject to the trip limit
for bocaccio taken and retained south of Cape Mendocino, no matter where the fish are possessed or landed. Similarly,
if a vessel is used to take and retain bocaccio north of Cape Mendocino and possesses or lands bocaccio south of Cape
Mendocino, that vessel is subject to the southern trip limit.

 An estimate will be made of the catch to the end of 1994 for the Washington coastal treaty tribes. It is anticipated that
these tribes will regulate their fisheries so as not to exceed their estimated catch. There will be no Federally imposed
tribal allocation or quota. In 1994, the estimated tribal catch is 300 mt, the same as in 1991, 1992, and 1993.

 The 1994 harvest guideline for sablefish is 7,000 mt. The 300-mt tribal-imposed catch limit is subtracted, and the
limited-entry and open-access allocations are based on the remaining 6,700 mt. The limited-entry allocation for
1994 of 6,070 mt is allocated 3,520 mt (58 percent) to the trawl fishery and 2,550 mt (42 percent) to the nontrawl fishery.
The trawl and nontrawl gear allocations are harvest guidelines in 1994, which means the fishery will be managed so
that the harvest guidelines are not exceeded, but will not necessarily be closed if they are reached.]

The final specifications and management measures for 1994 are issued under the authority of and in accordance with
the regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 611 and 663. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the data necessary for these specifications and management measures comes from the current fishing season.
Because of the timing of the receipt, development, review, and analysis of the fishery information necessary for
setting the initial specifications and management measures, and the need to have these specifications and management
measures in effect at the beginning of the fishing year, there is good cause to waive the publication of proposed specifications
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 30-day comment period on the proposed specifications. Amendment 4 to the FMP, implemented on January 1, 1991,
recognized these timeliness considerations, and set up a system by which the interested public was notified, through

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice and Council mailings of meetings, and of the development of these measures, and was provided the opportunity
to comment during the Council process. The public participated in GMT, Groundfish Advisory Subpanel, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, and Council meetings in August, September, October, and November 1993 that resulted
in these recommendations from the Council. Additional public comments will be accepted for 30 days after publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA will consider all comments made during the public comment period
and may propose modifications as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule is being issued without prior notice and opportunity for public comment, preparation of a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis is not required and none has been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrative Procedure Act requires that publication of an action be made not less than 30 days before its effective
date unless the Secretary finds and publishes with the rule good cause for an earlier effective date. Good cause for
waiving the delay in effectiveness is found if the delay is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public
interest. These specifications announce the harvest goals and the management measures designed to achieve those
harvest goals in 1994. A delay in implementation could compromise the management strategies that are based on the
projected landings from these trip limits. Therefore, a delay in effectiveness is contrary to the public interest
and these actions are effective on January 1, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule amends the regulations governing the Pacific coast groundfish limited-entry fishery to:
(1) Clarify distinctions between holders, owners, and lessees of limited-entry permits in the Pacific coast groundfish
fishery by adding definitions of these terms and making minor corrections consistent with the new definitions; (2)
clarify that shrimp (including spot and ridgeback prawn) trawls, California halibut trawls, and California sea
cucumber trawls are ``exempted gear''; (3) delete trip limits for groundfish taken in the pink shrimp and spot and
ridgeback prawn trawl fisheries; (4) designate trip limits in the pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries
as ``routine'' management measures; (5) modify the method of calculating allocations for the ``open-access'' fishery;
and (6) clarify that the sablefish ``regular'' season for nontrawl gear only applies to the limited-entry groundfish
fishery. These actions are necessary to make the regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Pacific
Coast Groundfish Fishery (FMP) consistent with Amendment 6 (limited entry) to the FMP, and to improve recordkeeping
and enforcement of regulations in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1992, NOAA promulgated regulations (57 FR 54001) that establish a license limitation limited-entry
program for the Pacific coast commercial groundfish fishery based on the issuance of gear-specific Federal permits
(the ``limited-entry program''). Under the program, permits are initially issued to owners of qualifying vessels.
Permits with type ``A'' gear endorsements are transferrable, and may be leased by one vessel owner to another. The
implementing regulations, codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C, use the terms ``permit holder'' and ``permit owner''
interchangeably, and do not clearly define the relationship between permit owners and permit lessees. This lack
of definition creates potential recordkeeping and enforcement problems. These problems stem from a person being
able to ``own'' a permit, but lease it to someone else. Maintenance of records identifying the permit owner, even if
the permit is currently registered to a lessee, is essential for recording and enforcement purposes. The NMFS records
system is the only place available to officially record permit ownership, and give notice to creditors, purchasers,
encumbrancers, and other interested parties. NMFS itself needs to know who owns the permit in the event it becomes
necessary to take an enforcement action such as sanctioning the permit or collecting a delinquent penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the first clarification made by this interim final rule is to add the following definitions for ``permit
owner,'' ``permit lessee,'' and ``permit holder.'' A ``permit owner'' is defined as the person owning the permit;
a ``permit lessee'' is defined as a person who does not own the permit, but has the right to possess and use it for a designated
period, with reversion to the permit owner; and ``permit holder'' is an umbrella term which includes both ``permit
owners'' and ``permit lessees.'' This rule amends the regulations in multiple paragraphs to use the term ``permit
owner'' rather than ``permit holder'' when appropriate, and to amend the definition of ``owner'' to ``owner of a vessel''
or ``vessel owner'' to distinguish a vessel owner from a ``permit owner.'' These revisions clarify that only permit
owners may transfer a limited-entry permit to a different person, thus not allowing a lessee to transfer the permit
to someone other than the permit owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to administration of the limited-entry program, the terms ``permit holder,'' ``permit owner,'' and
``permit lessee'' are used for ease of understanding only, and do not signify traditional property rights. As stated
in Amendment 6,

Groundfish limited entry permits and endorsements confer a right to participate in the Pacific coast groundfish
fishery with a limited entry gear in accordance with the limited entry system established under the Pacific Coast
Groundfish FMP as modified by this chapter of the FMP (created under Amendment 6) or any future amendment which may
modify or even abolish the limited entry system. The permits and endorsement are also subject to sanctions, including
revocation, as provided by the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. at 1858(g) and 15 CFR part
904, subpart D.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second clarification revises the definition of ``exempted gear'' in the implementing regulations. Section
4.2.1 of the FMP states that exempted gear includes all gears other than groundfish trawl, longline, and fishpot (which
are limited-entry gears). The FMP points out that shrimp trawl gear, a non-groundfish trawl gear, is an exempt gear.
Shrimp trawl gear is not defined in terms of physical attributes, but includes trawl gear used to take pink shrimp,
or spot or ridgeback prawns. Two other trawl fisheries, California halibut and California sea cucumber, also have
been identified as non-groundfish trawl fisheries, which have traditionally landed small quantities of groundfish
as a bycatch. However, the implementing regulations at 50 CFR 663.31 define ``exempted'' gear as all types of fishing
gear except trawl, longline, and trap (or pot) gear, thus inadvertently excluding shrimp, California halibut, and
California sea cucumber trawl gear from participation in the open-access fishery. This action clarifies that ``exempted''
gear includes all gear other than longline, trap, and groundfish trawl gear. Trawl gear used to take pink shrimp, spot
prawns, ridgeback prawns, California halibut, or California sea cucumbers is specifically defined as ``exempted
gear.'' ``Limited-entry gear'' is redefined to include ``groundfish trawl gear'' rather than ``all trawl gear.''
A new definition of ``groundfish trawl gear'' is added to include only trawl gear used under the authority of a valid
Pacific Coast Groundfish limited-entry permit affixed with an endorsement for trawl gear.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third and fourth clarifications address how trip limits are established for groundfish taken in trawl fisheries
for pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries. Trip limits for groundfish in these fisheries have been fixed
in the regulations at 50 CFR 663.24(a) and (b). The trip limits were codified because the Council did not foresee any
future need to revise them under the management regime that existed prior to limited entry. Under Amendment 6, however,
groundfish bycatch in the shrimp and prawn trawl fisheries is managed as a component of the ``open-access'' fishery
because it is taken with ``exempted gear.'' Amendment 6 provides for the establishment of trip limits for bycatch
of groundfish with exempted gear in the open-access fishery to make sure that the total catch of each species and species
group does not exceed the historical catch proportions during the limited-entry qualifying period, and that the
open-access allocations are not exceeded during the fishing year. Because the amount of effort in the open-access
fishery may change over time, Amendment 6 contemplated that trip limits may need frequent revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific coast groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 663.23(c) establish a category of management measures called
``routine.'' Routine measures include the types of management measures, primarily trip limits but also including
trip frequency limits and bag limits in the recreational fishery, that need to be adjusted frequently in order to manage
the fishery consistent with the FMP's goals and objectives. Once a particular management measure has been established
by regulation as ``routine,'' the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) may recommend that the Secretary
adjust that measure at any time, following consideration at a single Council meeting and publication of the adjustment
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, provided that the purpose for the adjustment is consistent with the rationale for needing frequent adjustments
that was articulated at the time the management measure was determined to be ``routine.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing regulations for Amendment 6 inadvertently omitted a ``routine'' designation for trip limits for groundfish
in the shrimp and prawn trawl fisheries. The routine designation is necessary in order to limit the open-access catch
of groundfish to its historical catch proportions and to ensure that the annual open-access allocation is not exceeded.
Thus, this rule deletes the trip limits in the pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries at 50 CFR 663.24(a)
and (b) while simultaneously designating them as ``routine'' under 50 CFR 663.23(c)(2) so that the Council may recommend
adjustments as necessary without undertaking the time-consuming regulatory amendment process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the procedures for routine designation, the Council considered the routine designation for trip
limits for pink shrimp and prawns at the September 1993 meeting and recommended the designation at its November 1993
meeting. Rockfish and sablefish trip landing and trip frequency limits for all gear are already designated as routine.
This action clarifies the regulations to include trip landing and frequency limits for rockfish and sablefish in
the open-access as well as the limited-entry portion of the Pacific coast groundfish fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth clarification addresses an inconsistency between how catches in the ``limited-entry'' and ``open-access''
fisheries are accounted for, and how the allocations are calculated for each fishery. 50 CFR 663.32(c) provides that
any groundfish caught by a vessel with a limited-entry permit will be counted against the limited-entry allocation
while the limited-entry fishery for that vessel's limited-entry gear type is open. Thus, for example, while the limited-entry
fishery for groundfish is open, any groundfish taken by a vessel with a limited-entry permit, even if it is fishing
with exempted gear such as shrimp trawl gear, will be counted against the limited-entry allocation. In sections II.E.(d)(3)
and (d)(4)(A)(1) and (2) of the appendix to part 663, the ``open-access'' allocation is derived by applying the open-access
allocation percentage to the annual harvest guideline or quota after subtracting any set asides for recreational
fishing or treaty Indians. The ``open-access allocation percentage'' is calculated by computing the total catch
during the limited-entry qualifying (window) period by longlines and traps (or pots) not initially receiving a limited-entry
endorsement for that gear, and by exempted gear, and dividing that amount by the total catch during the window period
by all gear. Thus, the groundfish catch taken during the window period with exempted gear by a vessel that initially
receives a limited-entry permit will be included in the open-access allocation even though the catch with that same
exempted gear in 1994 and beyond will count against the limited-entry allocation as long as the limited-entry fishery
is open. To rectify this inconsistency, this rule amends the regulations to provide that the window period catch by
vessels not initially receiving limited-entry permits will count toward the ``open-access'' allocation; conversely,
the window period catch with exempted gear by vessels initially receiving a limited-entry permit will count toward
the ``limited-entry'' allocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule clarifies that the ``regular'' season with longline and fish trap (or pot) gear (nontrawl gear)
for sablefish refers only to the ``limited-entry'' fishery. Vessels participating in the ``open-access'' fishery
are not affected by the regular season because they are regulated under open-access trip landing limits which extend
throughout the year.

This rule makes minor changes designed to clarify and facilitate implementation of Amendment 6. NMFS became aware
of the need for these changes while implementing the Pacific coast groundfish limited-entry program, a new and complex
regulatory system. These changes need to be in place when the fishery itself begins to operate under the limited-entry
system on January 1, 1994. Most of the changes effected by this rule are necessary to conform the implementing regulations
to the letter and intent of Amendment 6 to the FMP. As such, these provisions were discussed and were subject to public
comment and scrutiny during the years the Council developed Amendment 6. Furthermore, the revisions and clarifications
are necessary to uniformly administer the program and to ensure accurate recordkeeping. These provisions will not
result in any significant changes in the day-to-day operating practices of the fishery. Accordingly, the Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d), that it would be unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to delay the effectiveness of these provisions pending advance notice and comment
and a 30-day delay in effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision of 50 CFR 663.22(d)(1) is the only change that was not necessarily contemplated by Amendment 6; however,
it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide advance notice and comment before the fishery
converts to limited-entry because, without it, permit owners and potential purchasers would be susceptible to substantial
losses if permits could be freely transferred by permit lessees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration
(ESA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) are publishing final regulations governing the filing and enforcement
of attestations by facilities seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered nurses under H&hyph;1A visas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attestations, required under the Immigration and Nationality Act, pertain to substantial disruption in the
delivery of health care services, absence of adverse effect on wages and working conditions of similarly employed
registered nurses, payment of wages to nonimmigrant alien nurses employed by the facility at wage rates paid to other
registered nurses similarly employed by the facility, taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and
retain U.S. nurses in order to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant alien nurses, absence of a strike or lockout, and
giving appropriate notice of filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities are required to submit these attestations to DOL as a condition for being able to petition the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) for H&hyph;1A nurses. The attestation process is administered by ETA, while complaints
and investigations regarding the attestations are handled by ESA.

The Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989 (INRA), Public Law 101&hyph;238, 103 Stat. 2099 (December 18, 1989), amended
the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to add new sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 212(m) governing the admission
to the United States of nonimmigrant aliens for employment as registered nurses (RN's) during a 5-year ``pilot''
period. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1182(m). The provisions which INRA added to the INA were further amended
by section 162(f) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978 (November 29, 1990),
and by section 302(e) (9) and (10) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments
of 1991 (MTINA), Public Law 102&hyph;232, 105 Stat. 1733 (December 12, 1991).

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
The provisions of INRA do not apply to nurses admitted under the free trade agreement with Canada, whose admission
is authorized under section 214(e) of the INA. Under the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the number of Mexican professionals (including registered nurses) entering
the United States pursuant to NAFTA is limited to 5,500 annually. This limit may be increased by agreement between
Mexico and the United States and will expire 10 years after NAFTA enters into effect, unless the two countries decide
to remove the limit earlier. Entry into the United States under these provisions of NAFTA neither forecloses nor establishes
their eligibility for entry under other similar provisions of the INA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As authorized by Paragraph 5(b) of Section D of Annex 1603 of NAFTA, during the period that the transition provisions
of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the NAFTA are in effect, Mexican nurses are subject to the labor attestation requirements
of section 212(m) of the INA. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(m); Section 341(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement its responsibilities with respect to the admission of Mexican nurses during the transition
period provided under the NAFTA, the Department will require health care facilities seeking to use the services of
Mexican registered nurses to file H&hyph;1A labor attestations under and pursuant to existing regulations implementing
section 212(m) of the INA, at 20 CFR part 655, subpart D; and 29 CFR part 504, subpart D. Complaints regarding such attestations
will be processed under and pursuant to existing regulations at 20 CFR part 655, subpart E; and 29 CFR part 504, subpart
E. This document amends the applicability section of the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 212(m) of the
INA pertaining to facilities using nonimmigrants as registered nurses under H&hyph;1A visas, to implement the provisions
of NAFTA.

, H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;288, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 1&hyph;4 (October 16, 1989). Some health care facilities had
been relying on nonimmigrant RN's admitted under H&hyph;1 visas to meet this need. However, the numbers of visas available
for such aliens to adjust their immigration status to permanent residency had been limited.

. at 2 and 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of INRA's enactment, many such RN's were approaching the end of their periods of admission to the United
States and faced return to their home countries. Many H&hyph;1 RN's potentially affected by the INRA were thought
to be employed in critical care and emergency service units.

the care provided to critically ill patients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, Congress was concerned about the perceived increased dependence of health care providers on foreign
RN's. As a result, the INA, as amended, links future access to nonimmigrant RN's to the taking of significant steps
by the facility to develop, recruit and retain U.S. workers in the registered nursing profession while ensuring that
the temporary foreign nurses admitted are protected in their employment and that their employment does not adversely
affect the employment of U.S. nurses. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities are required to file attestations with DOL attesting to certain conditions and to steps taken to recruit
and retain U.S. nurses in order to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant alien nurses. Facilities are required to submit
these attestations to DOL as a condition to being able to petition INS for admission of H&hyph;1A nurses. The attestation
process is administered by ETA, while complaints and investigations regarding the attestations are handled by ESA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The INRA-amended portions of the INA were amended by IMMACT to make clear that where nursing contractors are involved,
both the contractor and the worksite facility (other than private households) must file attestations, but granted
the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) some discretion in determining the requirements of the worksite facility attestation.
MTINA further amended the INA to clarify Congressional intent concerning the ``no lay off'' provision, to specify
that a facility that has laid off a nurse other than a staff nurse still meets the ``no lay off'' requirement, if it attests
that it will not replace the nurse with an H&hyph;1A nurse for 1 year after the lay off.

B. Attestation Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The INA requires a health care facility seeking access to temporary foreign RN's (under the H&hyph;1A visa category)
to file an ``attestation'' with the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) on an annual basis. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a)
and 1182(m)(2)(A) and (C). This includes worksites (except private households) seeking to use the services of an
H&hyph;1A nurse through a nursing contractor. See IMMACT section 162(f). The attestation must assure that the following
six statutory criteria are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There would be a substantial disruption through no fault of the facility in the delivery of health care services
of the facility without the services of such alien(s). A facility is not considered to meet this clause if, within the
previous year, it laid off RN's, unless such RN's were other than staff nurses and the facility has attested that it
will not replace them with H&hyph;1A visa nurses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The employment of the alien(s) will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of RN's similarly employed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The alien(s) employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for RN's similarly employed by the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The facility has taken and is taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient RN's
who are United States citizens or immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as
quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on nonimmigrant RN's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The facility is subject to an approved State plan for the recruitment and retention of nurses (see 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment of such alien(s) is not intended
or designed to influence an election for a bargaining representative for RN's of the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) At the time of the filing of the petition for RN's, notice of the filing has been provided by the facility to the bargaining
representative of the RN's at the facility or, where there is none, notice of the filing has been provided to RN's employed
at the facility through posting in conspicuous locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A)(i) through (vi).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the following is a ``significant step'' reasonably designed to recruit and retain RN's (see Item (4)(a) above):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Operating of training program for RN's at the facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training
program for RN's elsewhere;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become RN's;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Paying RN's wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to RN's similarly employed in the geographic area;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Providing adequate support services to free RN's from administrative and other non-nursing duties; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by RN's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(B) (i) through (v); see 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A)(iv)(I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Items (i) through (v) above are not an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to meet the requirements
of the fourth attestations element, and a facility is not required to take more than one step if the facility can demonstrate
than taking a second step is not reasonable. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special rules apply to cases where an alien nurse, for whom an employer has filed an attestation, is performing services
at a worksite other than the employer's worksite or other than a worksite controlled by the employer. In cases of temporary,
emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good
cause, the Secretary may waive such requirements for the attestation for the worksite as the Secretary may determine
are appropriate, in order to avoid duplicative attestations. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A) (as amended by section 162(f)(2)(B)(iii)
of IMMACT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These attestations (and visa petitions supported by them) are available for public examination in the Employment
and Training Administration (ETA) National Office in Washington, D.C. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E)(i). The Department
also informs the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) which attestations have been accepted. The employer
must furnish evidence to INS that the Department has accepted its attestation for filing as a prerequisite for INS
approving a petition to bring in foreign RN's under H&hyph;1A visas (which visas are issued by the U.S. Department
of State (DOS)). 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, DOL's administrative functions under the INRA include, with certain limited exceptions, receiving
and accepting attestations for filing, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
checking that the attestation form is properly completed and that the required explanatory statements are provided.
DOL reviews elements of attestations in only four instances: (1) the facility attests to a ``non-standards'' indicator
of substantial disruption (Element I); (2) the facility takes as one of its two steps a ``non-standard'' timely and
significant step (Element IV); (3) the facility attests that taking a second timely and significant step under Element
IV would not be reasonable; and (4) the facility is not an employer of H&hyph;1A nurses and is claiming a bona fide medical
emergency as the basis for requesting a waiver of one or more of the attestation elements. The Department also makes
the accepted attestations available for public inspection, and notifies INS of those attestations that DOL has on
file. These administration functions are delegated, by regulation, to ETA.

C. Complaints, Investigations and Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also authorized to investigate allegations that a facility has failed to meet the conditions attested
to or that a facility has misrepresented a material fact in an attestation. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E) (ii) through (v).
If violations are found, DOL may impose administrative remedies, including civil money penalties (CMP's); shall
notify the Attorney General, who shall not approve H&hyph;1A petitions for a period of at least 1 year for the facility;
shall obtain back wages; and may impose other remedies. These activities constitute the Department's enforcement
functions under the INRA. Under the regulations, the enforcement functions are delegated to the Department's Employment
Standards Administration (ESA), Wage and Hour Division.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, pursuant to the INRA, the Secretary appointed an advisory group which includes representatives of DOL,
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General, hospitals, and labor organizations representing
RN's. Pub. L. 101&hyph;238 section 3(c)(2), 103 Stat. at 2103.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the INRA, the advisory group advises the Secretary on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The impact of this legislation on the nursing shortage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Programs that health care facilities may implement to recruit and retain U.S. RN's, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State recruitment and retention plans, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The advisability of extending the law beyond the current 5-year duration of this pilot program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advisory group operates under the auspices of the DOL Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy.

E. Operating Experience
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 6, 1990, an interim final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to implement the Department's responsibilities relating to attestations by facilities seeking to use nonimmigrant
aliens as registered nurses. 55 FR 50500. This interim final rule incorporated many of the comments the Department
received on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which was published in the July 6, 1990, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 55 FR 27992; see also 55 FR 30720 (July 27, 1990). The interim final rule went into effect on the date it was published
and established a comment period that ended February 4, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking was the Department's first experience with defining and implementing an attestation process. The
interim final rule required attestations to be filed in the ETA National Office to allow it to gain operating experience
in this new process. The final rule published below decentralizes the processing of H&hyph;1A attestations to four
ETA regional offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attestation includes a completed Form ETA 9029 and accompanying statements that explain briefly how the facility
complies with the various attestation elements and describe the documentation available at the facility that demonstrates
compliance. In the case of facilities attesting to ``other'' indicators of substantial disruption, ``other'' timely
and significant steps, the unreasonableness of taking more than one timely and significant step, and/or a bona fide
medical emergency, the attestation must also include more detailed information describing how the prescribed standards
are being met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attesting facilities are required to maintain sufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance with the statutory
and regulatory standards for each of the attestation elements. The attestation, along with supporting documentation,
must be maintained by the facility on site in a separate file. The file shall also contain visa petitions supported
by the attestation. Any interested party may request to see this file. The facility is required to make all of the information
in the file available within 72 hours of receiving a request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ETA has provided for a 30-day time period to determine whether an attestation can be accepted for filing. All attestations
are examined to ensure that the Form ETA 9029 is properly completed and that the explanatory statements contain the
required information. In the case of facilities attesting to ``other'' indicators of substantial disruption, ``other''
timely and significant steps, the unreasonableness of taking more than one timely and significant step, or a bona
fide medical emergency, the explanatory information is reviewed to ensure that the prescribed standards are being
met. Attestations which meet the established criteria are accepted for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time the interim final rule was promulgated, ETA estimated that approximately 1,000 facilities per year would
be submitting attestations. Experience has proven this estimate to be too low. Approximately 1,500 facilities submitted
attestations the first year the H&hyph;1A attestation process was in effect. Approximately 1,400 facilities submitted
attestations during the 1992 fiscal year. It should be noted, however, that the number of attestations received was
substantially larger than the number of facilities submitting attestations, because many facilities submitted
attestations that were returned as unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As employers' experience with the 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;&blank;H&hyph;1A program has increased, the proportion of attestations that ETA returns because they are
unacceptable for filing has decreased from 43 percent to the current level of 23 percent. The two most common reasons
why ETA is not able to accept attestations for filing are that the Form ETA 9029 is not properly completed and the required
explanatory statements are not included with the submission. ETA returns unacceptable attestations to the facility
with a letter explaining why the attestation cannot be accepted for filing. The facility may file a new attestation
which corrects the deficiencies. There are no restrictions on how frequently they may be refiled. Most facilities
which have submitted attestations not accepted for filing continue to refile their attestations until they are accepted
for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over 70 percent of the attestations have been submitted by health care facilities located in six States_California,
New York, New Jersey, Texas, Illinois, and Florida. Approximately 90 percent of the attestations received have been
submitted by three types of facilities: about 62 percent by acute care facilities; 22 percent by long-term care facilities;
and 6 percent by nursing contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was estimated in the interim final rule that 10 notices of strikes or lockouts and 10 annual State plans would be submitted
per year. However, ETA has received notice from an attesting facility of a strike that lasted 1 day. ETA has not received
any annual State plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 6, 1990, invited comments through February 4, 1991. 55 FR 50500. comments were received from 21 organizations
and individuals, including employers and employer associations, labor organizations, a nurse association, a commission,
an attorney association, two individual attorneys, one Member of Congress, and one State employment security agency
(SESA). The 41 comments received on the NPRM were discussed at 55 FR 50501&hyph;50504 and are further discussed in
pertinent part below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The labor organizations and other organizations representing the interests of registered nurses asserted that
the interim final rule did not offer U.S. nurses the protection offered in the proposed rule, while the attorneys and
commenters representing the interests of employers asserted that the interim final rule did not go far enough in ``streamlining''
the attestation process. See 55 FR 27992 (July 6, 1990); and 55 FR 30720 (July 27, 1990). Some commenters stated that
the Department had been successful in addressing concerns that the proposed definition of ``nurse'' did not take
into consideration the differences among State governments in defining nursing duties and practices and did not
clearly state that foreign nurses who have not been licensed by State nursing boards must have passed the Commission
on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) Examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major concerns expressed by commenters on the interim final rule included: the type of and location for retention
of supporting documentation; the waiver provisions; DOL's role in reviewing attestations; the definition of ``facility'';
and the indicators of substantial disruption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the comments received on the interim final rule, as well as those comments received on the proposed rule that
may not have been fully addressed in the interim final rule, have been reviewed and considered in preparing this final
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Location for Retention of Supporting Documentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three labor organizations and one Member of Congress commented that supporting documentation should be available
at DOL, as well as at the facility. The attorneys commented that only the Form ETA 9029 should be submitted to DOL and
that the requirement concerning the accompanying explanatory statements should be removed in the final rule. Two
employer associations commented in support of the interim final rule provisions which require the attestor to maintain
the supporting documentation at the facility, but these commenters wanted the rule to be more specific about the explanatory
statements to be submitted with the Form ETA 9029.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the interim final rule, ETA found the comments offered by Former Representative Bruce
Morrison, then Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International
Law when INRA was passed, and one of the principal authors of the legislation, to be very persuasive. In commenting
on the proposed rule, Representative Morrison voiced his support for the kinds of supporting documentation required,
and indicated that the intent of a streamlined attestation process would best be served by keeping the amount of documentation
filed with the attestation to a minimum, and requiring the bulk of it to be retained at the facility. (The preamble to
the interim final rule also pointed out that the Office of Management and Budget in its official comments to the Department
on the paperwork burden stated that there should be a streamlined attestation process.) See 55 FR at 50502.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments received during this rulemaking concerning the location for retention of supporting
documentation, and considering the fact that the comments received from Representative Morrison and OMB are consistent
with a ``complaint driven process'' for investigating and resolving complaints, the Department has decided to retain
the interim final rule's provisions concerning the location of the supporting documentation. The facility must
submit to DOL only a brief statement of what documentation is available at the facility to demonstrate compliance
with the various attestation elements. The full documentation must be retained at the facility for the duration of
the attestation period, and for as long thereafter as the facility continues to employ an H&hyph;1A nurse hired under
the attestation. Further, the facility must attest that the documentation will be available for public examination
within 72 hours of receiving a request. Failure to provide access may be the basis for a complaint as a ``failure to perform.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. DOL Authority To Review Attestations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney commenting on the interim final rule questioned whether DOL has the authority to review any H&hyph;1A
attestations, and an employer and an attorney association commented that the DOL role in reviewing attestations
should be reduced. However, two of the labor organizations submitting comments voiced concern that the interim final
rule weakened DOL's role in reviewing attestations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule prescribed a substantial review function by DOL. As indicated in the preamble to the interim final
rule, ETA found the comments of Representative Morrison and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, highly persuasive. Both Representative Morrison
and Senator Kennedy expressed the view that the proposed DOL review function was greater than that intended by the
legislation. This was also the view expressed by many health care facility commenters. See 55 FR at 50502. In response
to these comments, the interim final rule substantially restricted the DOL review function. As indicated above,
DOL reviews elements of attestations in only four instances. For all other attestations, the DOL function is limited
to checking that the attestation Form ETA 9029 is properly completed, the required explanatory statements are included,
and the facility is attesting to compliance with the regulatory standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has concluded that the provisions governing DOL's review function, set forth in the interim final
rule should be retained. After a careful review of the comments received both on the proposed rule and on the interim
final rule, considering that only minimal documentation is submitted, and, in view of the fact that the H&hyph;1A
program relies on a ``complaint driven process'' for investigating and resolving complaints, DOL has determined
that no further change in this provision is warranted.

3. Indicators of Substantial Disruption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 10 comments concerning the indicators of substantial disruption under Attestation Element
One. One attorney commented that the rule should not be more specific than the legislation in addressing ``substantial
disruption''; and an employer commented that a simple description of the steps taken to fill vacant nursing positions
should suffice as evidence that there would be a substantial disruption without the services of nonimmigrant alien
nurses. In contrast, one employer commented that the requirement that a facility document its recruiting efforts
does not belong in the section of the regulations dealing with substantial disruption. The employer also commented
that the documentation requirements under &sect;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(3) should be limited to the total number of nursing vacancies and the total number of H&hyph;1A nurses employed
at the time the attestation is submitted. Other commenters recommended adding more specific requirements to &sect;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(2) and allowing facilities to count as vacant all positions encumbered by H&hyph;1A nurses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INRA was enacted to allow facilities to use nonimmigrant alien nurses temporarily to help alleviate substantial
disruptions in health care services, while requiring that facilities take steps designed to develop, recruit and
retain a trained U.S. workforce as the long-term solution to the current nursing shortage. One of the legislatively-mandated
elements that a facility must attest to in order to have its attestation accepted by DOL is a substantial disruption
in health care services due to a shortage of nurses (absent the services of the nonimmigrant alien nurses on whose behalf
they are petitioning).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule listed four possible indicators of substantial disruption. These indicators were identified
by organizations representing both employers and nurses as being those most commonly experienced throughout the
health care industry. However, this provision was not intended to be an exhaustive list. When a facility finds that
the indicators of substantial disruption listed in the regulations cannot be demonstrated or that such indicators
are inappropriate to that facility, the facility may propose an alternative indicator of substantial disruption
under the ``other'' category. A facility attesting to an ``other'' indicator of substantial disruption is required
to provide an explanation which clearly shows a substantial disruption in the delivery of specific health care services
due to a shortage of nurses. For example, a facility that has a large number of H&hyph;1A nurses with visas that will
be expiring within the next 12 months may be able to demonstrate that it will experience a substantial disruption if
it cannot petition INS for extensions of stay and/or new H&hyph;1A nurses. Such a facility may choose to attest to an
``other'' indicator substantial disruption. The facility would then be required to demonstrate that it has made
conscientious efforts to recruit and retain U.S. nurses but has a history of being able to fill only a small percentage
of its vacancies with U.S. nurses, and that it projects a vacancy rate of at least 7 percent, if it cannot continue to
petition INS for H&hyph;1A nurses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOL has determined that the four indicators of substantial disruption listed in the interim final rule, coupled with
the ``other'' indicator of substantial disruption, strike the proper balance in addressing the concerns raised
in the comments. These indicators satisfy the need for standardized criteria that can be used by facilities in determining
whether they qualify to file an attestation and by DOL in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities. Therefore,
they have been retained in this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on its operating experience, the Department has determined that a brief explanatory statement is
not necessary if the employer attests to a vacancy rate of 7 percent or more, or to an unutilized bed rate of 7 percent
or more. The employer is still required to maintain supporting documentation and to make it available for review at
the facility in accordance with &sect;

4. No Adverse Effect
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A nurses' association, a labor organization, and one Member of Congress submitted comments endorsing the Department's
approach to determining no adverse effect on wages. The labor organization and the Member of Congress advocated using
the same approach to determining whether there would be no adverse effect on working conditions. A nationwide employer
organization and a statewide employer association both commented that the rule should state that the wage need only
be the lowest point on the prevailing wage range since most H&hyph;1A nurses start out in entry-level positions. One
attorney commented that facilities should not be required to get prevailing wage determinations prior to filing
their attestations, and another attorney and an attorney association commented that the prevailing wage requirement
should be deleted entirely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments received, the Department has determined that there will be no substantive
changes made to the interim final rule's requirements concerning no adverse effect on wages and working conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement concerning no adverse effect on wages is statutory and, as such, cannot be removed from the regulations.
As pointed out in the preamble to the interim final rule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The phrase ``not adversely affect the wages'' is a well established legal term of art that has been used for decades
in alien labor certification programs, with a very specific meaning of at least the area prevailing wage for the occupation
*&blank;*&blank;*. Presumably Congress was aware of this meaning in incorporating this language in the INRA. [55
FR at 50506.]
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prevailing wage rate is derived by averaging the wages paid by a sample of facilities in the geographic area. If
the prevailing wage determination was not obtained prior to submitting the attestation, the facility would not have
the knowledge needed to determine whether it could truthfully attest to paying each nurse it employs at least the prevailing
wage for the geographic area, nor would it be able to attest to having the supporting documentation available at the
facility for examination by interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating experience has indicated that clarification is desirable as to how far in advance a health care facility
can obtain the prevailing wage from the SESA. Some facilities have allowed an inordinate amount of time to elapse between
obtaining a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and filing an appropriate attestation. Since prevailing
wage surveys and determinations are frequently updated by SESA's, to minimize the possibility of adverse effect
on the wages of U.S. registered nurses the prevailing wage determination should be reasonably contemporaneous with
the filing of the attestation. To assure that the prevailing wage determination supporting the attestation is current
the regulation at 20 CFR 655.310(e)(1)(i) has been amended to require filing of the attestation within 90 days of the
date the prevailing wage request was submitted to the SESA by the facility.

XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(e)(1)(i) of the interim final rule requires that a facility obtain a prevailing wage determination from the
SESA. Although the SESA and ETA administrative system provide an avenue for a facility to challenge a SESA determination
through the Employment Service (ES) complaint process (see 20 CFR part 658, subpart E), the interim final rule did
not specifically identify that process. The final rule provides needed clarification by directing the facility
to the ES complaint process and alerting the facility that a challenge of a SESA determination may be made only prior
to filing an attestation in which that SESA determination is used. Implicit and essential in this process is the requirement
that once a facility obtains a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and files the attestation without challenging
the SESA's determination through the ES complaint system, the facility has in effect accepted the determination
and waived its right to challenge the determination. Permitting a facility to operate under a determination and later
contest it in the course of an investigation or enforcement action is contrary to sound public policy; such a delayed,
disruptive challenge would have a harmful effect on U.S. and H&hyph;1B nurses, competing hospitals, and other parties
who may have relied on the wage provided by the facility on the attestation. Section &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(3)(1)(i) of the final rule explicitly states the Department's clarification of the use and consequence of the
ES complaint process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding working conditions, the final rule, as did the interim final rule, applies an adverse effect standard on
a facility basis, due to the administrative infeasibility of making prevailing practice determinations on an area-wide
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the documentation requirements for pay and compensation, a Member of Congress commented that the interim
final rule did not require specific enough documentation. He suggested that the rule should require specific wage
and job data for individual nurses and positions, not summaries. However, a statewide employer association expressed
concern that the interim final rule made confidential information available to the public. This commenter suggested
that such information should be available only to the Department of Labor and/or others as hospital policy allows.
Former Representative Morrison, in commenting on the NPRM, which contained documentation requirements much like
the interim final rule, voiced his support for the kinds of supporting documentation required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments received, the Department has determined that there will be no changes
made to the interim final rule's requirements concerning documentation of no adverse effect on wages and working
conditions. Employers should note that if a complaint is filed, an investigation conducted, and a hearing held, any
employer information submitted as evidence for the hearing will become a matter of public record. Such information
may well be more extensive than that which the employer must make available for public examination. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E).

5. Notification of Strike or Lockout
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One employer commented that the requirement that the facility notify ETA within 3 days of the occurrence of a strike
or lockout at the facility involving registered nurses should be changed to allow the facility 10 days to notify ETA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that the current requirement that ETA be notified within 3 days of the occurrence of
a strike or lockout provides the facility with adequate time for making the required notification, since the facility
will be aware of any such occurrence immediately. The current protections offered to U.S. nurses would be weakened
if the 3-day notification period were lengthened. Therefore, no change is being made in the requirements governing
notification of strike or lockout.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Notification of Filing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney commented that the requirement that facilities notify their employees when they file an attestation
is burdensome to employers and goes beyond what is in the statute. The attorney recommended that facilities be required
to provide notice only of the filing of H&hyph;1A visa petitions with INS and only from the time of filing until the alien
begins work. The attorney also commented that the current requirement concerning the availability for public examination
of the supporting documentation goes beyond what should be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While INRA amendments to the INA call for notice of filing when the visa petition is filed, the accompanying House Judiciary
Committee report on INRA (then called H.R. 3259) recommending that the bill pass without amendment, stated on page
5 that:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he facility is required to provide notice of filing of an attestation to various labor representatives or to post
a notice in a conspicuous location. The Committee believes that notice of filing is an important element of the new
procedure, particularly in view of the fact that this is one of two mechanisms available for U.S. nurses to monitor
the admission of foreign nurses and its possible effect on their employment situation. [H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;288,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that the notice requirements are consistent with the intent of Congress that all aspects
of the process should be open to public review. Additionally, this approach is necessary to facilitate the complaint
and investigative process that is called for in the INA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received numerous comments critical of the interim final rule's provisions concerning waivers of
certain attestation elements. Such waivers may be requested by facilities which are not themselves employers of
H&hyph;1A nurses, but which use H&hyph;1A nurses employed by contractors. Three labor organizations opposed the
interim final rule's waiver provisions. One of these organizations expressed opposition to allowing any waivers,
while another commented that the provisions go beyond the statute and allow for circumvention of legislative intent.
One Member of Congress commented that waivers for temporary emergency situations should be very narrow and for a short
period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One attorney commented that the waiver provisions should be expanded so that facilities only using H&hyph;1A nurses
employed by contractors would not be required to file an attestation. Such a broad waiver would go beyond the scope
of the statute. The Secretary only has the discretion to waive attestations for worksites using nonimmigrant nurses
employed by contractors ``to avoid duplicate attestations in cases of temporary circumstances, with respect to
information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause.'' Section 212(m)(2)(A) of the INA as
amended by section 162(f)(2)(B)(iii) of IMMACT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has carefully considered the comments concerning the waiver provisions set forth in the interim final
rule. With the above one exception, none of the commenters made any specific recommendations for revisions to these
provisions which would address the concerns raised. No need or basis for revisions are indicated by the Department's
operational experience, the Department has received very few requests for waivers during the 2 years the program
has been in operation. Therefore, for the above reasons, no changes have been made to this section in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney organization commented that contractors should not be required to comply with each attestation element.
The commenter suggested that, at most, they should be required to attest that their employees will be paid at a rate
equal to the rate for nurses similarly employed by the facility where they are placed. The Department does not have
the authority to make such a change. Amendments to the INA by IMMACT require that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the contractor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the worksite facility (other than private households) file attestations. These amendments grant the Secretary
discretion to determine the requirements of the attestation filed by the worksite facility, but they do not grant
the Department the authority to waive any attestation elements for contractors. To the contrary, IMMACT amended
the INA to make clear that, where nursing contractors are involved, both the contractor and the worksite facility
(other than private households) must file attestations.

9. Definition of ``Facility''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One labor organization commented in support of the definition of ``facility'' set forth in the interim final rule,
which requires an employer with multiple sites to file an individual attestation for each site unless the sites are
in reasonable geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share the same nursing staff and equipment. On
the other hand, one employer and an attorney recommended that a multi-site employer should be allowed to file a single
attestation so long as the same employer controls each worksite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOL carefully considered this multi-site issue during the development of both the NPRM and the interim final rule
and determined that any advantages of a ``single attestation'' would be offset by the problems it would cause. Area
prevailing wage rates would be different for sites in different geographic areas. Entities would be significantly
increasing the vulnerability of their entire system to suspension from the program, should one of their sites incur
a violation or should a lay off of nurses occur at only one of their sites. It should be noted, however, that multi-site
entities may develop materials that could be used by all of their sites, with perhaps some minor modifications. See
55 FR at 50504.

10. State Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters stated that the section dealing with State plans for the recruitment and retention of nurses should
be expanded. One labor organization commented that the regulations need to specify that a State may use a State plan
to impose obligations on a facility that go beyond those that would be applicable in the absence of a State plan. One
Member of Congress commented that the regulations should specify that the list of eight components of a State plan
is not an exhaustive list and that States should be encouraged to develop additional components. An employer association
commented that the regulations should include the criteria that will be used for determining whether to approve State
plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the Department has received no State plans. All of the changes suggested by the commenters would make the section
dealing with State plans more restrictive. The Department believes that any additional restrictions would further
discourage States from developing and implementing State plans. Therefore, no revision has been made to this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

11. Definitions of ``U.S. Nurse'' and ``U.S. Worker''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions of ``United States (U.S.) nurse'' and ``United States (U.S.) worker'' in the interim final rule include
U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, permanent resident aliens, and temporary resident aliens. A Member of Congress commented
that refugees and asylees should be included in both of these definitions, since refugees and asylees are lawfully
in the U.S., are allowed to work for an indefinite period of time, and there is nothing in the statute that excludes them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments received from the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices
(OSC) of the Department of Justice during the rulemaking process implementing the IMMACT amendments to the permanent
labor certification program, the definition of ``U.S. worker'' for the purposes of that program was amended to include
within that definition ``protected individuals'' under the INA's unfair immigration-related employment practices
provision. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3); see 56 FR 54920, 54926 (October 23, 1991); see also 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5)(A); and 20
CFR part 656. To meet the definition of a ``protected individual'', one must be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or an
alien in one of four citizenship status categories: (1) permanent resident; (2) temporary resident (including seasonal
and replenishment agricultural workers); (3) refugee; or (4) asylee. To remain a ``protected individual'', these
aliens must complete the naturalization process within a specified period of time. Protected individuals can work
indefinitely in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The H&hyph;1A interim final rule's definitions of ``U.S. nurse'' and ``U.S. worker'' included all ``protected individuals''
except refugees and asylees. To have consistent definitions of the term ``U.S. worker'' in the certification and
attestation programs administered by DOL, the definitions of ``U.S. nurse'' and ``U.S. worker'' have been clarified
and amended in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

12. Layoff Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
INRA amended the INA to provide that a facility cannot meet the first attestation element, relating to a substantial
disruption in the delivery of health care services, if, within the past 12 months it has laid off any registered nurses.
In the interim final rule the Department interpreted this statutory provision to cover lay offs of all individuals
who are licensed registered nurses, regardless of the positions they held within the health care facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MTINA amended the INA to clarify Congressional intent regarding lay offs, by specifying that a facility which has
laid off a registered nurse other than a staff nurse still meets the ``no layoff'' requirement, if, in its attestation,
the facility attests that it will not replace the nurse with an H&hyph;1A nurse (either through promotion or otherwise)
for a period of 1 year after the date of the layoff. In the final rule, section &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(1) has been revised to incorporate this statutory amendment. The definition of ``layoff'' in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.302 has been revised to specify that if staff nurses are separated from one specialized activity, the retraining
and retention they are offered must be in another activity involving direct patient care at the same facility in order
for their separation not to be considered a ``layoff'', and a sentence has been expanded to indicate that a ``staff
nurse'' means a nurse who provides nursing care directly to patients Item 8.a(i) on the Form ETA 9029 has also been modified
to reflect the amendment to the ``no layoff'' provision.

G. Technical and Clarifying Amendments in Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Decentralization to the Regional Offices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule required that attestations be submitted to the ETA National Office. This was done as a temporary
measure, in order to allow the National Office, which is responsible for establishing the policies and procedures
for administering the program, an opportunity to gain first-hand experience in administering an attestation program.
It was believed that this experience would assist the National Office in developing regulations and in providing
policy guidance for regional offices once they were assigned responsibility for administering the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule decentralizes the processing of attestations for four ETA regional offices_Boston, Chicago, Dallas,
and Seattle_by revising &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(b) and by making the modifications required elsewhere, so that the entire body of the rule reflects this decentralization.
Information on the addresses of the four regional offices and the States served by each has been added to the instructions
for completing the Form ETA 9029.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(c)(1)(iii) of the interim final rule, a facility submitting an attestation prior to April 1, 1991, was allowed
to claim business exigency as a basis for delaying the compilation of documentation supporting its attestation for
up to 90 days after submission of its attestation. This provision, now obsolete, which was intended to ease the transition
from the H&hyph;1 to the H&hyph;1A program, has been deleted from the final rule since the applicable date has passed.

accordance with section 212(m)(2)(A)(i) of the INA, as the elimination or curtailment of essential health care services
not otherwise available ``at the facility.'' Section 212(m)(2)(A)(i) of the INA requires the facility to attest
that ``there would be a substantial disruption through no fault of the facility in the delivery of health care services
of the facility without the services of [the] alien''. The final rule makes this change, so that the third indicator
of substantial disruption, as described in

XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(2)(C) of the final rule reads so that it applies to the elimination or curtailment of health services at the
facility.

4. Timely and Significant Steps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 212(m)(2)(E)(iv) of the INA provides that a violation will be found if a facility ``fail[s] to meet a condition
attested to''. The regulation, &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(g)(1), has been modified, in accordance with this statutory directive, to specify that employers will be held
responsible for all timely and significant steps to which they attest. If, for example, the employer attests it is
taking four timely and significant steps, but is found in an investigation to be complying with only two, a violation
will be cited. It should be noted that the INA requires a minimum of two steps, unless taking a second step would be unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule required a facility taking the third timely and significant step specified in section 212(m)(2)(B)(iii)
of the INA_the facility is paying nurses at a higher rate than nurses similarly employed in the_area to maintain documentation
showing that its entire schedule of wages for nurses is at least 5 percent higher than the prevailing wages, as determined
pursuant to 22 &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(e)(1). The question arose whether, in the case of a facility where wages for nurses are the result of arms-length
collective bargaining, this regulation required the facility to pay at least 5 percent higher than the collectively-bargained
rate in order to attest to the third statutory step. The Department has concluded that it is not reasonable to require
that facilities pay 5 percent higher than a collectively-bargained rate, if such a wage is at least five percent higher
than the prevailing wage for the geographic area as determined by the SESA. Therefore, in the final rule &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been amended to allow a facility the option of attesting to the third timely and significant step if its entire
schedule of collectively-bargained wage rates is 5 percent above the prevailing wage as determined by the SESA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, an employer organization, suggested a new waiver provision. This commenter proposed that any facility
which can demonstrate that it is unable to meet the requirements for nursing services under title XVIII or title XIX
of the Social Security Act, or that can demonstrate that it fails to meet minimum federal or state statutory requirements
for nursing staff, should be exempt from the fourth attestation element_timely and significant steps. The Department
has concluded that it does not have the authority to promulgate such a waiver, since timely and significant steps are
required by the statute.

5. Review of Attestations Accepted and Not Accepted for Filing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule's provision for administrative-judicial review of a determination by DOL whether or not to
accept an attestation for filing has been clarified. Under &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.301(e), an appeal may be taken to the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals only on an ETA determination where
ETA has performed a review function. The four instances in which ETA performs a review function involve determinations
on the following issues only: (1) The facility attests to a ``non-standard'' indicator of substantial disruption
(Element I); (2) the facility takes as one of its two steps a ``non-standard'' timely and significant step (Element
IV); (3) the facility attests that taking a second timely and significant step under Element IV would not be reasonable;
and (4) the facility is not an employer of H&hyph;1A nurses and is claiming a bona fide medical emergency as the basis
for requesting a waiver of one or more of the attestation elements.

6. Technical Amendments to Enforcement Subpart
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on ESA's operational experience with the H&hyph;1A program, three technical changes have been made in subpart
E on enforcement. First, to regularize the hearing process, while remaining consistent with Congressional intent
regarding timely hearings for interested parties, the final rule specifies that, once the deadline for requesting
a hearing has expired, an interested party may participate in an administrative law judge proceeding only with the
approval of the judge. Further, to make the hearing and notification process more easily understood, the final rule
has a separate section setting out the stages at which the enforcement determination becomes final agency action
and notification (if any) is sent to ETA and INS. In the interim final rule, these provisions appeared in the same section
with the provisions regarding the ESA determination notification, and this regulatory structure was somewhat confusing.
In addition, the final rule contains an express statement of the opportunity to direct inquiries and requests for
technical assistance to the Wage and Hour Division of ESA. The final rule also expressly authorizes the filing of hearing
requests by facsimile transmission (FAX) and requires that the Solicitor of Labor will be appropriately served with
hearing requests. Finally, the rule has been modified to make corrections regarding cross references and citations.

II. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in the final rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and have been assigned OMB Control No. 1205&hyph;0305.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on operating experience, technical changes were made to the Form ETA 9029 to clarify the attestation requirements
and reduce the need for separate explanatory statements. The Department believes that the changes to the form will
result in a decrease in the proportion of attestations returned to employers because they are unacceptable for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included among the changes made to the form are the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The phrase ``no explanatory statement required'' has been added as a parenthetical after the first two indicators
of substantial disruption under item 8.a.(ii), to make it clear that explanatory statements are no longer required
for these two attestation elements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The word ``past'' has been added before ``elimination/curtailment'' in the third indicator of substantial disruption
under item 8.a.(ii), to make it clear that the elimination or curtailment must already have occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Language has been added under item 8.b. clarifying that in order to be in compliance with the no adverse effect wage
requirement the facility must be paying each nurse it employs at least the prevailing wage as determined by the SESA
unless wages for nurses at the facility are the result of a collective bargaining agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The words ``developed under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act'' have been added to item 8.d.(i)
to clarify that the State plan has to be one developed pursuant to the requirements of the INA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The words ``steps of comparable timeliness and significance'' have been added to the sixth box under item 8.d.(ii)
to clarify the ``other'' timely and significant step category.

ETA estimates that 1,400 facilities per year will be submitting attestations. The public reporting burden for this
collection of information is estimated to average 8&hyph;10 hours for searching existing information/data sources
and gathering and compiling the data at the facility the first year that a facility submits an attestation. In the second,
and subsequent years, the reporting burden, based on operating experience, will average 2&hyph;3 hours.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes the H&hyph;1A program to provide relief for the nursing shortage
crisis. Subpart D of this part sets forth the procedure by which health care facilities seeking to use nonimmigrant
registered nurses may submit attestations to the Department of Labor relating to the effects of the nursing shortage
on their operations, their efforts to recruit and retain United States workers as registered nurses and certain information
on wages and working conditions for nurses at the facility. Subpart E of this part sets forth complaint, investigation,
and penalty provisions with respect to such attestations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The INA establishes a procedure for health care facilities to follow in seeking admission to the United States for,
or use of, nonimmigrant nurses under H&hyph;1A visas. The procedure is designed to reduce reliance on nonimmigrant
nurses in the future, and calls of the health care facility to attest, and be able to demonstrate, that, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 there would be substantial disruption to health services without the nonimmigrant nurses and that it is taking timely
and significant steps to develop, recruit, and retain U.S. nurses. Subparts D and E of this part set forth the specific
requirements for those procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Subparts D and E of this part apply to all facilities that seek the temporary admission or use of nonimmigrants as
registered nurses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During the period that the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) apply, subparts D and E of this part shall apply to the entry of a nonimmigrant who is a citizen of Mexico under
and pursuant to the provisions of section D of Annex 1603 of NAFTA.

Complaints.

 Complaints concerning misrepresentation in the attestation or failure of the health care facility to carry out the
terms of the attestation may be filed with the Wage and Hour Division (Division), Employment Standards Administration

may include assertions that a facility's attestations of compliance failed to meet the regulatory standards for
attestation elements under which the attestation was accepted by ETA for filing without ETA review. The Division
shall then investigate, and, where appropriate, after an opportunity for a hearing, assess sanctions and penalties.
Subpart E of this part also provides that interested parties may obtain an administrative law judge hearing and may
seek the Secretary's review of the administrative law judge's decision.

Facility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a user of nursing services with either a single site or a group of contiguous locations at which it provides health
care services. ``Facility'' includes an employer of registered nurses which provides health care services in a home
or other setting, such as a hospital, nursing home, or other site of employment, not owned or operated by the employer
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a visiting nurse association or a nursing contractor). ``Facility'' also includes a private household which employs
or seeks to employ one or more H&hyph;1A nurses, but does not include a private household which uses H&hyph;1A nurses
only through a nursing contractor. Groups of structures which form a campus or separate buildings across the street
from one another are a single facility. However, separate buildings or areas which are not physically connected or
in immediate proximity are a single health care facility if they are in reasonable geographic proximity, used for
the same purpose, and share the same nursing staff and equipment. An example is an entity which manages a nursing home
and a hospital in the same area and which regularly shifts or rotates the nurses between the two. Non-contiguous sites,
even within the same geographic area, which do not share the same nursing staff and operational purposes are not a single
facility. For example, hospitals which are located on opposite sides of a municipality, but which are managed or owned
by a single entity, are separate facilities if they do not regularly share nursing staff and operational purpose.

to the attesting facility to include a sufficient number of facilities to permit a prevailing wage determination
to be made. If the place of the intended worksite is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), any place within
the MSA may be deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of intended employment.

constitute a layoff. The layoff provision applies to staff nurses only, not to other health occupations. If the position
occupied by the staff nurse is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement
definition of ``layoff'' (if any) shall apply to that position.

(3) Be fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements which
authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to practice as a registered nurse immediately
upon admission to the United States, and be authorized under such laws to be employed by the employer. For purposes
of this paragraph, the temporary or interim licensing may be obtained immediately after the alien enters the United
States and registers to take the first available examination for permanent licensure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) It has a current nurse vacancy rate of 7 percent or more. An explanatory statement does not have to be submitted for
this attestation element, but documentation to support this attestation shall be maintained at the facility and

provide brief explanatory information about the essential services eliminated or curtailed by the facility due
to a nursing shortage, what documentation is available at the facility to substantiate this attestation, where this
documentation is located and can be reviewed, and the applicable time period of the documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) It has been unable to effect established plans to provide needed new health care services in the community due to
a shortage of nurses, and provide brief explanatory information about needed new services that have not been implemented
by the facility due to a nursing shortage and which will be implemented with the availability of H&hyph;1A nurses,

 When an attesting facility finds that the indicators in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section cannot
be demonstrated, or that such indicators are inappropriate to that facility, but that without the services of H&hyph;1A
nurses, substantial disruption in the delivery of health care services of the facility still would occur due to a shortage
or nurses, the facility shall provide an explanation of how a shortage of nurses has caused a ``substantial disruption''
in the delivery of its health care services. Such explanation shall be sufficient to provide a clear showing of ``substantial
disruption'' in the delivery of specific health care services due to a shortage of nurses, and shall clearly explain
why the indicators in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section cannot be met by or are inappropriate to
that facility. In addition to the documentation required to be maintained by attesting facilities described in paragraph
(d)(3) of this section, facilities attesting under this paragraph also shall maintain and make available for inspection
(as described elsewhere in this section) such additional documentation as is necessary to substantiate such claim
of substantial disruption.

 To meet the requirement of no adverse effect on wages, the facility shall attest that it shall pay each nurse of the facility
at least the prevailing wage for the occupation in the geographic area. The facility shall pay the higher of the wage
required pursuant to this paragraph (e) or the wage required pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State employment security determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facility does not independently determine the prevailing wage. The State employment security agency (SESA)
shall determine the prevailing wage for similarly employed nurses in the geographic area in accordance with administrative
guidelines or regulations issued by ETA. The facility shall request the appropriate prevailing wage from the SESA
not more than 90 days prior to the date the attestation is submitted to ETA. Once a facility obtains a prevailing wage
determination from the SESA and files an attestation supported by that prevailing wage determination, the facility
shall be deemed to have accepted the prevailing wage determination as accurate and appropriate (both to the occupational
classification and wage) and thereafter shall not contest the legitimacy of the prevailing wage determination in
an investigation or enforcement action. A facility may challenge a SESA prevailing wage determination through the
Employment Service complaint system. See 20 CFR part 658, Subpart E. A facility which challenges a SESA prevailing
wage determination shall obtain in final ruling from the Employment Service prior to filing an attestation. Any such
challenge shall not require the SESA to divulge any employer wage data which was collected under the promise of confidentiality.

The steps described in this paragraph (g)(1) shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the significant steps
that may be taken to meet the conditions of this paragraph (g)(1). Nothing in this subpart or subpart E of this part shall
require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable.
The facility is not required to have taken any of these steps prior to December 18, 1989. A facility choosing to take
timely and significant steps other than those specifically described in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section
shall submit with its attestation a description of the steps it is proposing to take and an explanation of how the proposed
steps are of comparable timeliness and significance to those described in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

Step Two: ``Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become
registered nurses.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This may include programs leading directly to a degree in nursing, or career ladder/career path programs which could
ultimately lead to a degree in nursing. A facility choosing this step shall maintain as documentation a description
of the content and eligibility requirements for both types of programs and an explanation of how the requirements
of this paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are satisfied by each program. Any such degree program shall be, at a minimum, either through an accredited community
college (leading to an associate's degree), 4-year college (a bachelor's degree), or diploma school, and the course
of study shall be one accredited by a State Board of Nursing (or its equivalent). For career ladder or career path programs,
the facility shall maintain documentation that the programs are normally part of a course of study or training which
prepares a U.S. worker for enrolling in formal direct training leading to a degree in nursing, either through an accredited
community college, a 4-year college, or a diploma school. See &sect;

total costs of such programs. U.S. workers participating in such programs shall be working or have worked in health
care occupations or health care facilities. The number of U.S. workers for whom such training is provided shall be
equal to no less than half the average number of vacancies for nurses during the 12-month period prior to the submission
of the attestation.

Step Three: ``Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to registered nurses similarly
employed in the geographic area.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A facility choosing this step shall maintain documentation showing that its entire schedule of wages for nurses is
at least 5 percent higher than the prevailing wages as determined by the SESA pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this
section, and it shall attest that such differentials shall be maintained throughout the period of the attestation's
effectiveness.

Step Four: ``Providing adequate support services to free registered nurses from administrative and other non-nursing
duties.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-nursing duties include such activities as housekeeping duties; food preparation and delivery; transporting
patients; providing occupational and respiratory therapy; answering telephones; running errands for patients;
and clerical tasks. A facility choosing this step shall not require nurses at the facility to perform non-nursing
duties. However, it is understood that on an infrequent non-recurring basis, nurses at the facility may perform one
or more of the tasks encompassed by the duties listed above in this paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or other non-nursing duties. Facilities choosing this step shall maintain documentation showing what steps they
have taken to ensure that nursing jobs do not include any of these duties and that such activity by nurses at the facility
occurs without regularity and infrequently. Such a facility also shall maintain documentation with respect to any
other steps being taken to relieve nurses from non-nursing duties, or to enhance the nursing function, such as computerizing
certain writing and routine functions performed by nurses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Five: ``Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by registered nurses.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Documentation for this step shall include documentation of systems for salary advancement based on factors such
as merit, education, and specialty, and/or salary advancement based on length of service with other bases for wage
differentials remaining constant.

nurses which lead to salary advancement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.

attestation what these steps are, their nature and scope, how they are effected and how they meet the statutory test
of timeliness and significance comparable to those Steps One through Five described above. A facility choosing alternative
steps shall attest that its program(s) meet(s) the statutory requirements of timeliness and significance in promoting
the development, recruitment and retention of U.S. nurses, explaining how these requirements are satisfied by such
program(s). In addition, the attesting facility shall maintain and make available for inspection (as described

Such monetary incentives can be based on actions by nurses such as: Innovations to achieve better patient care, increased
productivity, reduced waste, better safety; obtaining additional certification in a nursing specialty; unused
sick leave; recruiting other U.S. nurses; staying with the facility for a given number of years; taking less desirable
assignments (other than shift differential); participating in professional organizations, on task forces and
on special committees; or contributing to professional publications. Facilities attesting to this step shall have

 The steps described in this paragraph (g)(1) shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the significant steps
that may be taken to meet the conditions of this paragraph (g)(1). Nothing in this subpart or subpart E of this part shall
require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable.
However, a facility shall make every effort to take at least two steps. A facility taking only one step shall provide
an explanation with its attestation, and maintain documentation at the facility, relating to why taking a second
step is not reasonable. The taking of a second step may be considered unreasonable if it would result in the facility's
financial inability to continue providing the same quality and quantity of health care or if the provision of nursing
services would otherwise be jeopardized by the taking of such a step. If the single step which is taken is one of the statutorily
defined steps described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)(A)(

Alternative to criteria for each specific step.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Instead of complying with the specific criteria for each of the steps in the second and succeeding years, a facility
may include in its prior year's attestation, in addition to the actions taken under Steps One through Five, that it
shall reduce the number of alien (H&hyph;1 and H&hyph;1A visaholders) nurses it utilizes within 1 year from the date
of attestation by at least 10 percent, without reducing the quality or quantity of services provided. If this goal
is achieved (as demonstrated by documentation maintained by the facility and made available for inspection, and
indicated in its subsequent year's attestation), the facility's subsequent year's attestation may simply include
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form ETA 9029,

 an explanation demonstrating that this goal has been achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and an attestation that it shall again reduce the number of alien nurses it utilizes within 1 year from the date of attestation
by at least 10 percent. This alternative is designed to permit a facility to achieve the objectives of the Act, without
subjecting the facility to detailed requirements and criteria as to the specific means of achieving that objective.
The first, second, and succeeding years shall be consecutive.

 The facility shall attest that ``there is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment
of such an alien is not intended or designated to influence an election for a bargaining representative for registered
nurses of the facility.'' Labor disputes for purposes for this attestation element relate only to those involving
nurses providing nursing services; other health service occupations are not included. This attestation element
applies to strikes and lockouts and elections of bargaining representatives at both the facility employing the nurse
and, in the case of nursing contractors, at the worksite facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A nursing contractor submitting an attestation for filing as a facility shall attest, in addition to the first through
sixth attestation elements, that it will refer H&hyph;1A nurses only to facilities that (with the exception of private
households which themselves do not employ H&hyph;1A nurses) have valid attestations on file with ETA. The nursing
contractor shall obtain from each such worksite facility a copy of that facility's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form ETA 9029, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
accepted for filing by ETA and then currently on file with ETA. The nursing contractor shall maintain a copy of such
worksite facility's accepted attestation on file at the nursing contractor's principal office during the validity
period of the nursing contractor's attestation or the period of time that any H&hyph;1A nurse in its employ is providing
nursing services at the worksite facility, whichever is longer.

Special provisions for worksite facilities which are not employers of H&hyph;1A nurses and are not controlled by
employers of H&hyph;1A nurses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A facility (other than a private household) which obtains the services of an H&hyph;1A nurse by contracting with a
nursing contractor, but which is itself neither the employer of any H&hyph;1A nurse nor controlled by the employer
of any H&hyph;1A nurse (see paragraph (k)(1) of this section), shall file an attestation with ETA pursuant to this
subpart. Such a worksite facility may request from ETA a waiver of specific elements of the attestation to avoid duplicative
attestations, in cases of temporary, emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge
of the attestor, or for other good cause. The attesting worksite facility shall be to ably demonstrate the existence
of the circumstances or good cause which are asserted as the basis(es) for the request for a waiver of a particular element
of the attestation, but need not submit such evidence with its request for waiver, except evidence with respect to
a bona fide medical emergency (see paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section).

Worksites employing, seeking to employ, or filing visa petitions on behalf of H&hyph;1A nurses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An attestation with respect to which waiver is requested or granted pursuant to this paragraph (k) is not valid (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not ``on file and in effect'') for a worksite facility employing, seeking to employ, or filing a visa petition on
behalf of H&hyph;1A nurses. Only an attestation meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section
(and paragraph (j) of this section, in the case of a nursing contractor) can serve as the basis for a petition for an H&hyph;1A
visa. A worksite facility which uses H&hyph;1A nurses only through a nursing contractor and, as part of its attestation,
requests waiver of one or more attestation elements nevertheless shall file a complete attestation in order to be
able to use such attestation as a basis for itself filing a visa petition for an H&hyph;1A nurse. Thus, a worksite facility
should consider its future needs for H&hyph;1A nurses in filing attestations and requests for waiver pursuant to
this paragraph (k).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inapplicability of third attestation element: facility/employer wage.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a worksite facility uses H&hyph;1A nurses only through a nursing contractor, the third attestation element (facility/employer
wage; see paragraph (f) of this section) is not applicable to that facility, since the worksite facility is not the
employer of the H&hyph;1A nurse and does not guarantee the H&hyph;1A nurse's wage. The third attestation element
is required only for the employer of the H&hyph;1A nurse(s), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the third attestation element shall be included in the attestation of and met by the H&hyph;1A nurse's employer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 the nursing contractor).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver of attestation elements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ETA may consider, pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) requests for waiver of certain attestation elements by a worksite
facility which uses or will use an H&hyph;1A nurse provided by a nursing contractor (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an ``H&hyph;1A contract nurse''), but which worksite facility itself does not employ, seek to employ, or file a visa
petition on behalf of an H&hyph;1A nurse. Paragraphs (k)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section set forth different
conditions for waiver depending on the number of workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services the worksite facility
will use. For the purposes of this paragraph (k)(3), a ``workday'' shall consist of one H&hyph;1A contract nurse working
for one normal shift in a day. Thus, for example, three normal shifts worked by each of a group of five H&hyph;1A contract
nurses totals 15 workdays.

Minimal use of H&hyph;1A contract nurses by a worksite.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it
will use no more than a total of 15 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's
1-year period of validity to meet emergency needs on a temporary basis, ETA may waive the first (substantial disruption),
second (adverse effect), and fourth (timely and significant steps or State plan) elements of the attesting worksite
facility's attestation. See paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section; see also paragraphs (f) and (k)(2) of this
section, with respect to the inapplicability of third attestation element (facility/employer wage). ETA shall
not waive pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3)(i) the fifth attestation element (strike, lockout, or intent or design
to influence bargaining representative election) or the sixth attestation element (notice). See paragraphs (h)
and (i) of this section.

 Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it
will use no more than a total of 60 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's
1-year period of validity to meet temporary needs, ETA may waive the nursing shortage component of the first element
(substantial disruption; see paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section) and may waive the fourth (timely and significant
steps or State plan; see paragraph (g) of this section) element of the attesting worksite facility's attestation.
See also paragraphs (f) and (k)(2) of this section, with respect to the inapplicability of third attestation element
(facility/employer wage). ETA shall not waive pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3)(ii) the no-layoff component of
the first attestation element (substantial disruption; see paragraph (d)(1) of this section); the second attestation
element (adverse effect); the fifth attestation element (strike, lockout, or intent to influence a bargaining representative
election); or the sixth attestation element (notice). See paragraphs (d), (e), (h), and (i) of this section.

 Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it
will use more than 60 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's 1-year
period of validity, ETA shall not waive any attestation element, except that, if the attestor documents a bona fide
medical emergency warranting a waiver of the fourth attestation element (timely and significant steps or State plan)
ETA may waive such element. See paragraph (g) of this section.

 A worksite facility (including a worksite facility which itself employs or seeks to employ an H&hyph;1A nurse) may
authorize a nursing contractor to act as its agent in preparing and filing the worksite facility's attestation; however,
a worksite facility using an agent for preparation and filing of the attestation is responsible for the contents of
such attestation and remains liable for any violations which may be disclosed in any investigation under Subpart
E of this Part, and the chief executive officer of the worksite facility shall sign the original attestation, as required
by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

.310 shall be accepted for filing by ETA on the date it is signed by the Certifying Officer. ETA shall then follow the
procedures set forth in paragraph (m)(1) of this section. An attestation submitted by a facility proposing alternative
criteria or steps for the first and/or the fourth attestation elements, and/or proposing to take only one timely and
significant step, and/or claiming a bona fide medical emergency exemption from the fourth attestation element shall
be reviewed by ETA, and a determination shall be made by the Certifying Officer whether to accept or reject the attestation
for filing. See paragraphs (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), and (k)(3)(iii) of this section. The Certifying
Officer may request additional explanation and/or documentation from the facility in making this determination.
If the Certifying Officer does not contact the facility for such information or make any determination within 30 days
of receiving the attestation, the attestation shall become accepted for filing. Upon the facility's submitting
the attestation to ETA and providing the notice required by the sixth attestation element (see &sect;

.310(i)), the attestation shall be available for public examination at the health care facility itself. When ETA
accepts the attestation for filing, the Certifying Officer shall forward the attestation to the ETA National Office,
where it shall be available for public examination. Information contesting an attestation received by ETA prior
to the determination to accept or reject the attestation for filing shall not be made part of ETA's administrative
record on the attestation, but shall be referred to ESA to be processed as a complaint pursuant to Subpart E of this part,
and, if such attestation nevertheless is accepted by ETA for filing, the complaint will be handled by ESA under that
subpart.

 Suspension or invalidation of an attestation may result from a BALCA decision reversing an ETA acceptance for filing;
from investigations by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, of the facility's misrepresentation in or failure
to carry out its attestation; or from a discovery by ETA that it made an error in its review of the attestation (in those
cases where ETA performs such review pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), (k)(3)(iii)

 If an attestation is suspended or invalidated as a result of a BALCA decision overruling an acceptance of the attestation
for filing, or is suspended or invalidated as a result of a Wage and Hour Division action pursuant to subpart E, such
suspension or invalidation may not be separately appealed, but shall be merged with appeals of BALCA's or the Wage

If a State determines to file an annual State plan, the Governor shall submit the original plan, signed by the Governor,
by U.S. mail or private carrier, to ETA at the following address: Director, U.S. Employment Service, Employment and
Training Administration, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N&hyph;4456, Washington, DC
20210. An annual State plan may be filed with ETA at any time. However, for an individual facility legitimately to attest

for filing and be in current effect. Therefore, if the Governor is aware that a facility within the State plans to submit
an attestation for filing with ETA, the annual State plan should be mailed to ETA at least 35 days prior to the facility's
submission of its attestation to ETA.

The annual State plan shall address the overall issue of supply of and demand for nurses within the State, with particular
emphasis on measures to develop a sufficient supply of U.S. nurses to meet projected demand. The State, as opposed
to individual facilities, is in a position to_and may be expected to_address broad issues and perform such functions
as conducting a Statewide needs assessment; overall management, facilitation and coordination among various interested
entities within the State; and undertaking more regionally based approaches. The State is also in a position to devote
resources which individual facilities may be lacking.

complaint shall be written or, if oral, shall be reduced to writing by the Wage and Hour Division official who receives
the complaint. The complaint shall set forth sufficient facts for the Administrator to determine what part or parts
of the attestation or regulations have allegedly been violated. Upon the request of the complainant, the Administrator
shall, to the extent possible under existing law, maintain confidentiality regarding the complainant's identity;
if the complainant wishes to be a party to the administrative hearing proceedings under this subpart, the complainant

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains a final rule amending the regulations on trade adjustment assistance for workers which implement
the 1988 Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 as contained in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. This
action will update the regulations and will provide uniform instructions to State agencies in carrying-out their
responsibilities under the Trade Act. These State agencies act as agents of the United States for the purpose of providing
adjustment assistance benefits and services to adversely affected workers. Comments are requested on the several
material changes being made in this final rule, which differ from the September 1988 proposed rule, and on a number
of other changes which were not included in the proposed rule.

In General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Trade Act of 1974 made major changes to the trade adjustment assistance program (hereafter ``TAA program'') for
workers displaced because of increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced
by the workers' firm. On receiving a petition for trade adjustment assistance (hereafter ``TAA'') from a group of
workers or its authorized representative, the Department conducts a factfinding investigation in response to the
petition. If the findings substantiate that the workers of a firm or subdivision of a firm have been adversely affected
by import competition, a certification is issued stating that the workers are eligible to apply at a local office of
a State employment security agency for TAA benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1981 Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 (Title XXV of Pub. L. 97&hyph;35) made extensive changes in the TAA program.
Further changes were made in the 1984 Amendments (Sections 2671 and 2672, of Pub. L. 98&hyph;369) and in the 1986 Amendments
(Part 1 of Subtitle A of Title XIII of Pub. L. 99&hyph;272). Final regulations implementing the 1986 Amendments were
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 24, 1988, at 53 FR 32344, and on May 23, 1989, at 54 FR 22277. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1988 Amendments to the TAA program are contained in Part 3, Trade Adjustment Assistance, of subtitle D of title
I of the ``Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988'' (Pub. L. 100&hyph;418) (hereafter the ``OTCA''). The 1988
Amendments expand eligibility for TAA to workers in the oil and natural gas industry engaged in exploration and drilling;
require detailed information about TAA program benefits to be given to every individual who files an initial claim
for unemployment benefits, and further require an individualized notice to every worker believed to be covered by
a certification issued by the Department; require publication of a notice of the certification in a newspaper of general
circulation; require a worker to participate in training as a condition for receiving basic trade readjustment allowances
(hereafter ``TRA''); authorize the waiver of the training requirement for a worker when training is not feasible
or appropriate; authorize the payment of basic and additional TRA to a worker during breaks in training that do not
exceed 14 days; reinstate the movable eligibility period for basic TRA, based on the worker's most recent qualifying
(total) separation rather than the first qualifying separation as was previously required; extend the expiration
date of the TAA program to September 30, 1993; emphasize coordination with programs and services to dislocated workers
provided under title III of the Job Training Partnership Act; and make other changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While most of the provisions of Part 3 affecting the TAA program are in the form of amendments to Chapter 2 of Title II
of the Trade Act of 1974, some provisions of Part 3 affecting workers do not amend existing law. Examples are the provision
which permits workers in the oil and natural gas industry engaged in exploration or drilling, separated after September
30, 1985, to file petitions under new eligibility rules, and the provision concerning the eligibility of workers
totally separated from adversely affected employment during the period beginning August 13, 1981, and ending April
7, 1986. The provisions of the 1988 Amendments became effective, in general, on August 23, 1988, except that the amendments
to sections 231(a)(5), (b) and (c) took effect on November 21, 1988, and the amendment to Section 225 took effect on
September 22, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because many of the 1988 Amendments were effective on the date of their enactment into law, August 23, 1988, most notably
the new ``movable'' eligibility period for basic TRA, the Department issued interim Operating Instructions in General
Administration Letter (hereafter ``GAL'') No. 7&hyph;88, dated September 12, 1988, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 16, 1988, at 53 FR 36180&hyph;36213, together with Training and Employment Information Notice (hereafter
``TEIN'') 6&hyph;88. GAL 7&hyph;88 and the two changes thereto were subsequently rescinded and replaced by GAL 15&hyph;90,
dated August 21, 1990. These GALs disseminated controlling guidance to the States on the administration of the TAA
program as amended by the OTCA, pending the issuance of final amendments to the regulations. GAL 15&hyph;90 was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 21, 1990, at 55 FR 48774&hyph;48800, together with TEIN 13&hyph;90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the issuance of GAL 7&hyph;88, amendments to the regulations at 20 CFR part 617, implementing the 1988 Amendments,
were proposed in a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 30, 1988, at 53 FR 48474, with a comment period ending on December 30, 1988. Preparation of a final rule document,
addressing the comments received, began after the end of the comment period. The need for other changes in the regulations
was identified in light of the comments received, further reflection on the 1988 Amendments, and experience with
the interim Operating Instructions. The most significant changes, resulting in the issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90 and
in delaying the publication of this final rule document, were the changes in the interpretations of subsections (a)
and (g) of Section 1430 of the OTCA, relating to the new ``movable'' eligibility period for basic TRA. This significant
change, and other related changes, were announced in GAL 15&hyph;90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule therefore includes substantive changes in the amendments to part 617 that were included in the proposed
rule published on November 30, 1988. The most significant of these changes are the new interpretations of the effective
dates of the 1988 Amendments relating to the ``movable'' eligibility period for basic trade readjustment allowances
(&sect;&sect;617.3 and 617.11(a) (1) and (2)). This document also includes substantive changes to Part 617 that
were not included in the published proposed rule, including sub-stantive changes that were announced in Changes
2 and 3 to GAL 15&hyph;90, relating to a complete revision of &sect;617.26 and a change in &sect;617.22(a). Many of
these substantive changes resulted from a consideration of comments received on the proposed rule. Nonetheless,
in the interests of keeping its rulemaking processes as open as possible, the Department is inviting public comments
on these changes. Further changes are made in &sect;&sect;617.3, 617.11(a), 617.15(b) and (d), 617.16, 617.19(b),
617.21, 617.22(f), 617.33, 617.44, 617.50(d), 617.55, 617.60 and 617.64, which are related to the revision of &sect;617.26
or for other reasons as explained below. Conforming changes are also made in &sect;617.67.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effective date of all of the substantive changes in the statute and the regulations that are announced in any GAL
(or change thereto) is the same as the effective date of the amendment(s) to which the GAL pertains, but any substantive
change in GAL operating instructions applies, unless stated otherwise, in the case of all decisions made after the
date of issuance of the GAL (or change thereto) by the Department. However, all of the substantive changes noted below
in items A through R are subject to an opportunity for comment after publication of this final rule. After the end of
the comment period, and consideration of any comments received, another final rule document will be published relating
to these substantive changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantive changes in the interpretations of the 1988 Amendments which are addressed below relate primarily to
the effective date and application of the new eligibility period for basic TRA, but also relate to other provisions
of the OTCA, the Trade Act of 1974 and section 106(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;318 which amends section 231(a)(2) of the
Trade Act, as discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's new interpretations center on the effective date provisions of subsections (a) and (g) of Section
1430 of the OTCA. These new interpretations are discussed in detail in paragraph A, below.

Good Cause Exception
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B), that good cause exists for publication in final of
the substantive changes in this document, because all of such changes are essential to the proper administration
of the TAA program by the States, and such changes either relieve a restriction, and have been previously announced
in controlling operating instructions issued to the States, or relate primarily to procedural relationships between
and among the States. In addition, because of the delays encountered in issuing this final rule, any further delay
in putting these substantive changes into effect would be impractical and contrary to the public interest. As explained
above, comments are invited and will be considered, after which a final rule will be published. In the meantime, public
implementation of these substantive changes as final regulations will not be delayed further.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the following text, therefore, substantive changes, on which comments are requested, are addressed first. These
changes are followed by a discussion of the comments received on the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The substantive changes noted under this heading are either changes in the amendments to part 617, as published on
November 30, 1988, or changes in other sections of Part 617 that were not included in the proposed rule. These substantive
changes also include conforming changes in the transition provisions of &sect;617.67.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are requested on all of these substantive changes, after which a final rule document on such changes will
be published.

A. New Eligibility Period for Basic TRA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1425 (a) of the OTCA amended section 233(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 to reinstate the ``movable'' eligibility
period for basic TRA. Section 1430(a) of the OTCA made this amendment effective on the date of enactment, August 23,
1988, and section 1430(g) of the OTCA provided that amended section 233(a)(2) would not be applied in certain circumstances
if it would result in an earlier expiration date of a worker's eligibility period established on the basis of the prior
law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988 (53 FR 48474) (as well as in Section 4.F.1. of GAL 7&hyph;88), Section
1430(a) was interpreted as making this amendment applicable to any total qualifying separation which occurred on
or after August 23, 1988. The limitation in section 1430 (g) was interpreted as applying with respect to any such total
qualifying separation if it would result in an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period of a worker based
on the prior law and a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In GAL 15&hyph;90, issued on August 21, 1990, the Department announced that, in conjunction with the development
of final regulations implementing the 1988 Amendments, the Department determined that the previously published
interpretations of the effective date provisions in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988, were in error.
The same erroneous interpretations were contained in GAL 7&hyph;88, and this fact necessitated the issuance of revised
operating instructions in GAL 15&hyph;90, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 21, 1990, at 55 FR 48774.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (a) of section 1430 of the OTCA provides that: ``Except as otherwise provided by this section, the amendments
made by this part shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.'' Subsection (a) thus applied to, among others,
the amendment to section 233(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, which prescribes the eligibility period for basic TRA.
In the proposed rule and in GAL 7&hyph;88, the amendment to section 233(a)(2) was interpreted as being applicable
to separations which occurred on or after the date of enactment of the OTCA, August 23, 1988.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the new interpretations announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, section 1430(a) was interpreted as applying to all decisions
(i.e., all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) made on and after August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concluded, and announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, that amended section 233(a)(2) should be applied to all
decisions rendered on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of whether they involved initial determinations of TRA
eligibility, redeterminations, or decisions on appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also stated in GAL 15&hyph;90 that the new interpretation of section 1430(a) is supported by the analysis
and construction placed on subsection (g) of section 1430, and by the general principle of law known as the law-in-effect
rule. Under the law-in-effect rule, the law to be applied in making any decision is the law in effect at the time the decision
is made. In GAL 15&hyph;90, this law-in-effect rule was determined to be applicable to the new interpretations and
the 1988 Amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (g) of section 1430 provides that the amendment to section 233(a)(2) ``shall not apply with respect to
any total separation of a worker *&blank;*&blank;* that occurs before the date of enactment of this Act if the application
of such amendment with respect to such total separation would reduce the period for which such worker would (but for
such amendment) be allowed to receive'' basic TRA. In the proposed rule and in GAL 7&hyph;88, section 1430(g) was interpreted
as limiting the application of amended section 233(a)(2) to total separations which occurred on or after August 23,
1988, where the result otherwise achieved would be an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period of a worker
established on the basis of the prior law and a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the new interpretations announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, section 1430(g) was interpreted literally as applying only
to total separations that occurred before August 23, 1988, and the limitation in section 1430(g) thus applies only
to such prior separations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consequence of this new interpretation of section 1430(g) is that, if the application of amended section 233(a)(2)
to a total separation prior to August 23, 1988, would result in extending the worker's eligibility period, the amended
section 233(a)(2) shall be applied. Conversely, amended section 233(a)(2) shall be applied to total separations
which occur on and after August 23, 1988, regardless of whether it would result in an earlier expiration date of the
worker's eligibility period based upon a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1430(g) is not applicable, however, to a ``first qualifying separation'' which occurs before August 23,
1988. It is on the basis of such a first qualifying separation that a worker would have a longer eligibility period ``but
for'' the amendment to section 233(a)(2). To preserve a longer eligibility period, and thereby give effect to the
limitation in section 1430(g), therefore, such limitation could not logically be made applicable to such a first
qualifying separation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more extensive explanation and justification for the new interpretations affecting amended section 233(a)(2)
was set forth in GAL 15&hyph;90, and in Attachment A and Section F.1. of GAL 15&hyph;90. That explanation and justification
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at 55 FR 48774, 48778, 48782, and 48789 (November 21, 1990).

The new interpretations require substantive changes in the final rule, particularly in the definitions of ``eligibility
period'' and the various types of ``separation'' defined in &sect;&sect;617.3(m) and 617.3(t), as well as in the
transition provisions in &sect;617.67. Other conforming changes are made throughout the document, including the
deletion of clause (D) in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(iii).

The Department also has decided that the 1988 Amendments relating to sections 231(a)(5), 231(b), and 231(c) of the
Trade Act, which, under section 1430(f) of the OTCA, took effect 90 days after the date of enactment (i.e., on November
21, 1988), are not affected by the new interpretation of section 1430(a). Although the effective date language of
section 1430(f) is the same as the effective date language of section 1430(a), the Department has determined that
the application of the new interpretation to these provisions would cause manifest injustice to affected workers
and also would appear to be contrary to the intent of the Congress and the logic of the 90-day delay in the effective date
of these amendments. This is more fully explained in GAL 15&hyph;90 and Attachment A.

Section 106(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;318 amended section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 by adding a new paragraph
(D) to the categories which are considered a week of adversely affected employment at wages of $30 or more a week in order
to qualify for TRA. The new subparagraph (D) provides that any week a worker is on call-up for active duty in a reserve
status in the armed forces, provided such active duty is ``Federal service'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8521(a)(1), shall
constitute a week in meeting the TRA qualifying requirements of section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974. Section
106(a) also clarifies that not more than 26 weeks described in subparagraphs (B) or (D) of section 231(a)(2) of the
Trade Act may be used for TRA qualifying purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This means that all of the required employment and wages necessary to qualify for TRA may be attained during a reservist's
call-up to active duty. This amendment only affects the TRA qualifying requirement in section 231(a)(2); all other
TRA qualifying requirements in section 231 are unchanged. Therefore, State agencies must also determine if a reservist
meets the remaining TRA qualifying requirements contained in section 231 of the Trade Act before awarding TRA entitlement
to the reservist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the worker's qualifying weeks at wages of $30 or more a week for TRA qualifying purposes, the amendment
to section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act applies to weeks beginning after August 1, 1990. The effective date of this amendment
results in a retroactive application to TRA claims filed (or which would have been filed) by reservists who took part
in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. This means that State agencies must redetermine the TRA initial claims
of all reservists called-up for active duty whose claims were denied solely because they did not meet the requirements
of section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act as in effect prior to the enactment of this amendment. State agencies must also
take TRA initial claims of reservists who did not previously file a TRA initial claim because they did not meet the requirements
of section 231(a)(2) as in effect prior to the enactment of this amendment.

Section 1425(b) of OTCA provides eligibility for TRA to certain workers who were continuously unemployed since separation
from adversely affected employment during the period from August 13, 1981 to April 7, 1986, not taking into account
seasonal employment, odd jobs, or part-time, temporary employment. This provision opened up eligibility to workers
who could not qualify for additional weeks of TRA because they did not meet the 210-day time limit for filing for training
and to workers who did not receive all of their TRA entitlement because their eligibility period was based on their
first rather than their most recent separation. In the proposed rule, general guidance was provided to State agencies
on ``continuously unemployed'' but State agencies were allowed to apply the provisions using their expertise in
determining eligibility relating to employment. However, the Department decided that it was essential to provide
State agencies with guiding instructions for implementing section 1425(b)(2)(A) (ii) of the OTCA so that the Department,
rather than States, defines the limits of the Federal liability. Accordingly, definitions to be used in applying
the terms ``seasonal employment'', ``odd jobs'' and ``part-time, temporary employment'' are added in a new clause
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(E). Because precise definitions were not available for each of these terms, definitions
were developed for purposes of this final rule from various sources and other program applications. The seasonal
provision of applicable State law is used in applying the ``seasonal employment'' provision. A definition for ``odd
jobs'' was developed in which the established period of employment occurs within 5 days or less. The definition for
``part-time'' is taken from the ETA Glossary of Program Terms and Definitions (ETA Handbook No. 373), which provides
for less than 30 hours per week of regularly scheduled work. However, that definition has to be applied along with ``temporary
employment.'' The definition for ``temporary employment'' is based on ETA reporting requirements for the public
employment service in which an established employment period of 150 days or less is used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to &sect;617.15 were included in the proposed rule published for comment on November 30, 1988. A further
change in &sect;617.15 was considered as a result of the reinstatement of the movable eligibility period for basic
TRA. This change was to base the 210-day period for filing an application for training, in order to qualify for up to
26 weeks of additional TRA, on the worker's most recent partial or total separation from employment under the certification,
rather than within 210 days after the date of the first qualifying separation. This change reinstates the rule that
was applicable prior to the 1981 Amendments, when the eligibility period was movable, and was adopted with the issuance
of Change 2 to GAL 7&hyph;88, dated May 22, 1989. In view of the new interpretation of section 1430(a), and the law-in-effect
rule, a further change was made in the interpretation and application of the 210-day rule, which was announced in GAL
15&hyph;90. The new interpretation applies to all decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions
on appeals) which are made after the date of issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90, on August 21, 1990. (See GAL 15&hyph;90 and
section E.4 of Attachment A). These changes are incorporated in &sect;617.15(b) of this final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule was published for comment on November 30, 1988. At that time, the Department had concluded that days
``in which training would not normally be scheduled'' should not be counted as part of a scheduled break in training.
Initially, the Department limited the exclusion to Saturdays and Sundays, if training in the applicable training
program would not normally be conducted on those days. In GAL 7&hyph;88, and Change 1 to GAL 7&hyph;88, the Department
interpreted section 233(f) of the Trade Act as excluding certain weekend days and holidays in counting the days of
a break in training. GAL 7&hyph;88 and Change 1 were unclear, however, whether the exclusion of holidays included
both National and State holidays. On further consideration, the Department agreed that all officially recognized
National and State holidays should be excluded in counting the days of a break in training, to the extent that training
in the applicable training program would not normally be scheduled on those days if they did not occur during the break.
This change was adopted with the issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90 and is applicable to all decisions (i.e., all determinations,
redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) which are made on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of when the training
was approved under section 236 of the Trade Act, or whether the training was approved or is approvable under section
236 as amended by the 1988 Amendments, or when the break in training began or ended. In making decisions under &sect;617.15(d),
the law to be applied is the law as in effect on the date the decision is made, and this rule has applied since the issuance
of GAL 15&hyph;90 on August 21, 1990. Decisions previously made under prior operating instructions are subject to
redetermination in accordance with State law, as set forth in section 4.b. of GAL 15&hyph;90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify what constitutes a ``break in training'' for purposes of section 233(f), a new clause (2) is added
to &sect;617.15(d) defining a break in training as including all periods within or between courses, terms, quarters,
semesters and academic years, whether or not such breaks are scheduled by the training provider.

G. Revision of &sect;617.16
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 234 of the Trade Act of 1974 specifies the State law provisions that shall be applicable to claimants for TRA
purposes, and &sect;617.16 distills the provisions of section 234 in a definition of ``applicable State law.'' Section
617.16 is now being revised for two essential reasons. The first reason is to include in the definition the situation
of the worker who is not entitled to UI after separation from adversely affected employment, as is provided for in Section
234. This had not seemed relevant after the 1981 Amendments, because of the addition in section 231(a)(3) of the eligibility
requirement that the worker must be entitled to and have exhausted all UI. The 1988 Amendments, however, have prompted
rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the States in the administration of the TAA program, and particularly
of the role of the ``applicable State'' (i.e., the State whose law is the applicable State law) in the case of TAA program
benefits other than TRA. Accordingly, the definition of ``applicable State law'' is broadened so that it is a useful
reference point for all TAA program benefits. While providing a useful reference point, there is no intent in revising

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.16 to suggest that an individual who is not entitled to UI after a qualifying separation from adversely
affected employment may be entitled to TRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second reason for revising &sect;617.16 is to conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.16 to the revision of &sect;617.26, relating to the roles and responsibilities of the States as liable
States and agent States in the administration of the TAA program. As discussed below, &sect;617.26 is revised to incorporate
the Department's thinking as set out in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90. In this connection, consideration was given to
including in &sect;617.16 the definition of ``applicable State'' which is set forth in Change 2. Upon further consideration,
however, it was decided that the definition of ``applicable State law'' furnished the most useful reference point
for all purposes of the TAA program, and that a special definition of ``applicable State'' is neither necessary nor
useful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;617.16 is revised to track more closely Section 234, and to serve as a useful reference point for
all of the purposes of the TAA program. The section also is modified to make it clear that the UI entitlement referred
to is that which immediately follows a qualifying separation from adversely affected employment, and not UI entitlement
in some past period, however recent or remote it may have been. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Revision of &sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clause (A) of &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii) explains that training is not appropriate when the firm from which the individual
was separated plans to recall the individual within the ``reasonably foreseeable future''. Also, &sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B)
defines ``appropriate'' as including whether there is a reasonable prospect which is reasonably foreseeable that
the individual will be reemployed by the separating firm. These provisions are consistent with &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii)
on conditions for approval of training when there is reasonable prospect of suitable work within the foreseeable
future. (See item 43 below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is reasonable to deny training under &sect;617.22 (a) to a worker who is scheduled for recall, there is an identified
need to provide additional guidance in the regulations on the application of the term ``recall that will occur in the
reasonably foreseeable future'', for purposes of administering &sect;&sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are consistent with the Administration's position to tighten waivers. Publication of these regulations
will improve efficiency in utilizing waivers. This moves the current TAA program in to closer alignment with the Transitional
Adjustment Assistance provisions of NAFTA. Therefore, this section is being amended by adding a new clause (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to &sect;&sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(A), for use in approving training and granting waivers. Clause (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) provides guidance on two types of planned recalls. The first type is a specific recall where an individual or group
of individuals who was separated from employment is identified and notified by the employer to return to work within
a specified time period. In this situation an individual would not be approved for training and a waiver of the training
requirement would be granted for purposes of receiving basic TRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type is a general recall where the employer announces an intention to recall an individual or group of individuals,
or by other action reasonably signals an intent to recall, but does not specify a certain time period in which the recall
will occur. In this situation, if the recall in each individual case is reasonably expected to occur after the individual
would exhaust his or her eligibility for regular UI associated with the most recent total separation that is within
the TAA certification period, the individual would be treated as any other individual who was separated from adversely
affected employment and the participation in training requirement would be applied.

I. Revision of &sect;617.21
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.21 describes the activities that are included as reemployment services and allowances. Paragraph (e)
of this section is revised to add child care as a support service. This revision is made to eliminate any uncertainty
that child care is a support service and that the costs for such service may not be charged as a related cost of training
and paid with TAA program funds. See also the Department's response to item 47 below.

Paragraph (g) of this section is also revised to reflect the 1988 Amendment to section 236 of the Act which added remedial
education as being approvable as classroom training. Training designed to enhance the employability of individuals
by upgrading basic skills, through remedial education or English-as-second-language courses, are considered
as remedial education approvable under &sect;617.22(a) if all the approval criteria in that section are met. A training
program of remedial education only may now be approved for an individual if he or she possesses occupational skills
and needs only remedial education to obtain employment. Ordinarily, remedial education is made part of a broader
skills training program as defined in &sect;617.22(f) (3).

J. Revision of &sect;617.22(a)(5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.22(a) lists six criteria that must be met for approval of training. These are intended to assure that training
will lead to a specific occupational goal. Clause (5) of &sect;617.22(a) deals with a worker's personal qualifications
to undertake and complete such training. The Department's interpretation of this clause has been changed to add ``financial
resources'' to those personal qualifications, and this change is included in amended &sect;617.22(a)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Change 3 to GAL 15&hyph;90, dated July 17, 1991, (56 FR 46331, 46333), announced a change in the definition of the criterion
for approval of training in Section 236(a)(1) (E) of the Act, by adding ``financial resources'' to the existing physical
and mental qualifications which must be reviewed in making a determination that a worker is able to undertake and complete
training, as set out for criterion (E) in Section G.1. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 and incorporated in this final
rule. This change was made to enhance the worker's ability to complete training by stressing that the duration of approved
training should be commensurate with the worker's financial resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training may be approved for a duration not to exceed 104 weeks under a single certification, as limited in amended
&sect;617.22(f)(2). However, combined UI and TRA entitlement is available to workers for a maximum of 78 weeks. When
the duration of training exceeds the remaining weeks of UI and TRA payments, a worker's income support may end or be
substantially reduced before completing the approved training program. This situation often results in workers
dropping out of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended &sect;617.22(a)(5) will require State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff to explain to workers seeking approval of training in which the duration of training exceeds their remaining
weeks of UI and TRA payments, that in the absence of other financial resources such training may not be appropriate.
When the worker's financial resources are not commensurate with a training program suitable to the worker, the training
requirement may be waived under &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B).

K. Revision of &sect;617.22(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual who satisfies the six criteria for approval of training in &sect;617.22(a) may be enrolled in a training
program that does not exceed 104 weeks in length. (See &sect;617.22(f)(2).) Inquiries were received on whether an
individual may pursue more than one training program under a single certification or whether training under a certification
is limited by the 104-weeks time provision. To eliminate any uncertainty on this matter, clause (2) on length of training
has been revised to state more clearly that the maximum duration for any approvable training program is 104 weeks and
no individual shall be entitled to more than one training program under a single certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of part 617, a new clause (3) is added to &sect;617.22(f), which provides a definition for a ``training
program''. Subclause (i) of clause (3) provides that a training program may consist of a single course or a group of
courses designed and approved by the State agency for an individual to meet a specific occupational goal. Subclause
(ii) of clause (3) authorizes State agencies to amend an individual's approved training program, when the duration
of training is less than 104 weeks, to add a course or courses designed to satisfy unforeseen needs, such as the need
for remedial education or specific occupational skills. However, the amended training program may not exceed the
104-week time limitation in clause (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clause (4), previously clause (3), is amended to clarify that the hours in a day and the days in a week an individual attends
an approved training program must be full time commensurate with the standards of the training facility. The purpose
of this amendment is to ensure that hours of training per week and length of the training program are scheduled in a manner
that the individual will develop the skills needed to achieve a specific occupational goal in a reasonable time period
and at a reasonable cost. Any week in which training is less than full time will still count as a full week for the purposes

L. Revision of &sect;617.26
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.26, entitled ``Approval of other training including interstate,'' was not among the sections of regulations
proposed to be amended in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988. However, rethinking occasioned by the
1988 Amendments led to the conclusion that there is a need to clarify, and in some respects alter, the roles and responsibilities
of liable States and agent States in the administration of the TAA program. Among the OTCA amendments that caused such
rethinking were those making training an entitlement and an eligibility requirement for basic TRA, and the provisions
of amended section 231(c) on training waivers. In addition, comments received on related sections of the proposed
regulations were considered in reaching this conclusion. The redescription of liable State and agent State roles
and responsibilities was announced in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90, which was published at 56 FR 46331, 46332. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;617.26, written in 1975, provides that the agent State shall be responsible for the selection and
approval of training, and will pay any training related costs, and that the liable State is responsible for determining
eligibility for TRA, job search and relocation allowances, and may approve and purchase training provided that certain
conditions are met. Although the respective roles of the liable and agent States were spelled out, the section was
silent on the legal relationships and the appellate authority in the case of determinations made by the agent State.
In addition, there were some overlapping responsibilities relative to training approval and payment of training
costs. The regulations as revised in this document address these issues and, in general, deal more comprehensively
with the roles and responsibilities of liable and agent States in administering the TAA program. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.26 is retitled ``Liable and agent State responsibilities'' and the roles of liable and agent States are
delineated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After examining State practices, as affected by the OTCA amendments, the Department has concluded that, as a general
rule, the agent State should continue to be responsible for procuring and paying for TAA approved training and related
costs, including subsistence and transportation, as appropriate. In addition, the agent State shall assist the
liable State in fulfilling its responsibilities for making determinations of entitlement to all TAA program benefits.
These changes are reflected in revised &sect;617.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another significant change in &sect;617.26 is in making the liable State responsible for all determinations, redeterminations,
and decisions on appeals pertaining to any worker's eligibility for or entitlement to any TAA program benefit under
Part 617. This includes determinations relating to training approval, disapproval, waivers and revocation of waivers
for training, and training related costs including subsistence and transportation. This requirement will preclude
due process objections which could be raised if workers were required to appeal some issues under the agent State law
and other issues under the liable State law. Responsibility for selection and approval of training no longer resides
in the agent State, as is provided in the present rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a liable State and an agent State may jointly agree to modify this rule with respect to their TAA administrative
functions, but any such change must comply with the legal requirement that all determinations will be under the authority
of the liable State, and all appeals by individuals will be under the law of the liable State. Further, prior approval
for any such modification must be obtained under &sect;617.54. (See also &sect;&sect;617.33 and 617.44, below.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, in those situations where two or more States share a common labor market area and workers commute across
State lines for work, those States may wish to develop cooperative arrangements, consistent with revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.26, and approved under &sect;617.54, to provide TAA ser-vices to adversely affected workers in the area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``liable State'' at &sect;617.3(aa) is also revised to conform with changes in &sect;&sect;617.16,
617.26, 617.33 and 617.44, and a definition is added for ``agent State''. (The term ``applicable State,'' which is
defined and used in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90, is not used in this final rule. It was decided that the terms ``liable
State'' and ``agent State,'' and the definition of ``applicable State law'' in &sect;617.16 were adequate to cover
the rules associated with interstate responsibilities without adding a further definition of ``applicable State.'')

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As revised in this final rule, &sect;617.26 comprehensively addresses the roles and responsibilities of liable
States and agent States in interstate cases, clarifies the legal and appellate relationships among the States, and
assures due process for workers and conformance with section 239(d) of the Act. With this revision, and other changes
in the rules, there is consistency among the regulations in addressing State responsibilities: &sect;617.16 covers
applicable State law; &sect;617.20 addresses State responsibilities for the delivery of reemployment services,
in general; &sect;617.33 addresses findings required before final payment of a job search allowance is made by the
liable State; &sect;617.44 addresses findings required before final payment of a relocation allowance is made by
the liable State; and &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 speak to determinations of entitlement, and appeals and hearings
under the applicable State law, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is made in &sect;617.50(a) by striking the clause ``, or the State agency as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.26(d),''.

Section 617.33 prescribes the findings required before final payment of a job search allowance is made to an eligible
worker by the liable State. It describes the responsibilities of liable and agent States in regard to those findings.

This section is revised to delineate more clearly the responsibilities of liable and agent States for determinations
(and appeal rights) regarding relocation allowances.

O. Revision of &sect;617.50(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.50(d) contains the rules on the use of State law and regulations in making and reviewing determinations
and redeterminations under part 617. Questions have arisen in at least two States whether the 210-day time limit in
&sect;617.15(b) (and section 233(b) of the Act) may be waived for good cause, or whether State law provisions on good
cause for late filing of UI claims may be applied. The Department has consistently taken the position that such good
cause provisions may not be applied, in view of the lack of authority for doing so in any provision of the Act or the regulations.
Nevertheless, State authorities in one State have ruled a number of times that there can be good cause for late filing.
And more recently, in a matter arising in another State, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision adverse
to the position of the Department. Because the Department believes that conclusions inconsistent with its longstanding
position do not comport with the Act, it has decided to address the issue in a broad manner and state as clearly as possible
in the regulations the precise situations in which State laws may be applicable in addressing issues arising under
the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sixth Circuit's decision started with the proposition that the Trade Act of 1974 was passed by the Congress ``during
a mood of congressional largesse,'' and that the 210-day rule in section 233(b) of the Act ``was not intended to act
as a jurisdictional prerequisite to additional TRA benefits.'' From this premise it reasoned that ``the purpose
of the rule is to discourage dilatory'' conduct by applicants, and that absent a finding of dilatory conduct ``the
application of the 210-day rule does nothing to further the Act's remedial purpose and everything to frustrate it''.
Citing another holding in the District of Columbia Circuit, the Sixth Circuit held that the Department's ``interpretation
makes sense only if there was a congressional policy in favor of limiting TRA benefits.'' The Sixth Circuit concluded
that: ``That court found no evidence of such a policy. Nor do we.'' From this line of reasoning the Sixth Circuit held
that the State's ``waiver for good cause rule [is applicable] in this context''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes the Sixth Circuit erred in relying upon the ``mood of congressional largesse'' in passing
the 1974 Act, without taking into account the critical redirection in the 1981 amendments away from TRA and towards
greater emphasis upon training (including changing the 233(b) rule from 180 days to 210 days), and the direct linkage
in the 1988 Amendments of training and eligibility for basic TRA (as well as additional TRA). In this context, there
is a sound reason for upholding the ``jurisdictional'' nature of the 210-day rule, and less reason for reaching out
to State law for a good cause exception, as distinguished from fashioning an exception from the language of Section
233(b). For these reasons, the Department believes the Sixth Circuit's decision was incorrect. The Department is
therefore moving to clarify the regulations to make its interpretation of the Act clearer.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering where in the regulations the clarification of the Department's position should be made, the Department
took into account the fact that there are other time limits expressed in the regulations, such as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;617.10(b), 617.31(c), 617.41(c), and 617.43(b). Since all such time limits may be vulnerable to the
same deviations that occurred with respect to the 210-day time limit, it was decided that a general rule was needed
that is applicable to all of part 617. The placement of this general rule thus fell logically in paragraph (d) of &sect;617.50.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, paragraph (d) of &sect;617.50 is amended to add the general rule that no provision of State law or regulations
as to good cause for waiver of any time limit or for late filing of any claim shall apply in the case of any time limitation
stated in part 617, unless such State law or regulation is made applicable by a specific provision of part 617. This
change eliminates any uncertainty about the Department's position, and places a clear obligation on the States to
adhere to the time limitations in all of part 617.

P. Revision of &sect;617.55
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 243 of the Act, on Fraud and Recovery of Overpayments, is interpreted as being drawn in broad terms so as to impose
liability for repayment of all improper payments under the Act, and to impose penalties for all false statements or
representations resulting in improper payments. Subsection (a) imposes repayment liability upon any ``person''
receiving an improper payment, whereas subsections (b) and (c) use the term ``individual'' in the fraud and recovery
provisions. In &sect;617.55, in contrast, the term ``individual'' is used throughout the liability, fraud, and
waiver provisions of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent experience in the administration of the TAA program has highlighted the difference between ``person'' and
``individual'' as such terms are commonly understood in other areas of law. The term ``person'' is more comprehensive,
and may include an employer or other entity or organization as well as an individual, whereas the term ``individual''
as used throughout part 617 typically means the individual workers who are the beneficiaries of the program. The question
that arose was whether &sect;617.55(a) was sufficiently broad in wording to impose repayment liability upon an employer
who had received improper payments for the on-the-job training. In examining this issue it became apparent that the
same issue existed with respect to payments for training of individuals that are made directly to training providers.
Although the payments in both cases may be said to be made on behalf of the individual workers, it is evident that, in
many cases (particularly in the case of on-the-job training), liability for repayment as well as responsibility
for fraud is more properly assignable primarily to the employer and possibly the training provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify the regulations, and to reflect the broad interpretation given to section 243 of the Act, &sect;617.55
is revised throughout to make it specifically applicable to any person or individual, and paragraph (i) is added to
define person as any employer or other entity or organization as well as the officers and officials thereof who may
bear individual responsibility.

Q. Revision of &sect;617.60
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new &sect;617.60, on Administrative requirements, was included in the proposed rule published on November 30,
1988, for comment. Although no comments were received, the substance of several of the provisions are affected by
other administrative regulations. Since further work is required to bring the TAA administrative requirements
into full conformity with those other regulations, the decision was made to reserve &sect;617.60 for use when the
revised TAA administrative requirements are completed and published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
R. Revision of &sect;617.64
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1986 Amendments to the Trade Act, section 285 was amended by, among other things, adding a subsection (b), to
provide that ``no assistance, allowance, or other payments may be provided under chapter 2 *&blank;*&blank;* after
September 30, 1991.'' This new subsection (b) superseded the current provisions in &sect;617.64, which were consistent
with the amendments made by section 2512 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. Section 1426(a) of the OTCA
extended the termination of the program to September 30, 1993. While the 1986 and 1988 amendments to the TAA program
changed the termination dates to September 30, 1991 and 1993, respectively, appropriate changes were not made to
&sect;617.64 concerning the payment of TAA program benefits after the termination date in the Act. Therefore, &sect;617.64
is amended to bring it into accord with the amended language in section 285 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A strict construction of the law, prohibiting the actual payment of TAA program benefits to individuals after the
termination date in the Act, would have a profound effect on those persons who completed approved TAA program services,
but, because of State processing requirements, payment for such services cannot be made by the State agency until
after the termination date in the Act. This strict construction would unnecessarily make the orderly termination
of the program impossible. It would deny payment of benefits to individuals for the period prior to the termination
date of the program simply because it was administratively infeasible to make the payment before the termination
date. Therefore, in order to avoid these untoward results stemming from a strict construction, a more liberal construction
of section 285(b) is necessary to effectuate the Congressional intent. A ``payment,'' within the meaning of section
285(b), will be deemed to have been made before the termination date of the program, if a final determination on the
amount payable to, or on behalf of, the individual for TAA program services was made on or before the termination date
of the program, for which payment was due.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This means that State agency approved job search and relocation, and training related transportation and subsistence,
must be completed on or before the termination date in the Act and that the State make a final determination on the amount
of TAA program funds payable to the individual on or before such termination date. This places the requirement on the
State agency to inform all individuals presently approved for such benefits of the statutory time provision that
the service must be completed and a final determination on the amount payable made on or before the termination date
of the program. It also places a requirement on individuals to complete the approved services and to submit all claims
for such activities to the State agency in time to receive a final determination on the amount payable on or before the
termination date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals approved for training who began approved training on or before the termination date in the Act must have
a final determination by the State agency on or before the termination date on the amount due and payable for the training
costs to cover previously incurred tuition and related expenses. Determinations on tuition shall be limited to the
current training term, quarter, semester, or other scheduled period, and be in accord with normal billing practices
of the training provider and payment practices of the State agency. In order to conform with the intent of the law, the
State agency may make a final determination on the amount payable only for the training term, quarter, semester or
other time period for which payment is due and payable on or before the termination date of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals entering training, and those currently in training programs which extend beyond the termination date
of the program, should be informed that no payments will be authorized or made for any costs or expenses which become
due and payable after the termination date of the program, nor will any such costs or expenses be paid prior to the expiration
date of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, only the last full TRA benefit week, for which a final determination has been made according to normal State
UI processing procedures on or before the termination date of the program, will be paid to any individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a claim for TRA is submitted to the State agency subsequent to the termination date in the Act, or for which a final
determination on the amount payable has not been made on or prior to the termination date of the program, the State agency
is required to issue a ``no-payment'' determination on the claim because the State may not refuse to take and process
the claim even though it is prohibited by statute from paying the claim. These provisions apply also to claims for job
search allowances under &sect;617.33 and for relocation allowances under &sect;617.44.

Discussion of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the proposed rule, the Department received written comments from two State Governors, fourteen State
employment security agencies, three labor unions, and one public interest group.

Eligibility period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (PDLI) recommended that clause (i) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.3(m)(1) (defining ``eligibility period'' for basic TRA) be amended by removing the word ``first'' after
the word ``individual'' in the seventh line, and by removing all language after the parenthetical clause ``(as defined
in paragraph (oo)(1) of this section).'' The PDLI stated that these deletions are necessary for the regulation to
conform to the eligibility requirement of Section 233(a)(2) prior to its amendment by the OTCA. The International
Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) commented that the proposed
rule incorrectly ties the eligibility period for basic TRA to the date on which the first qualifying separation occurs,
and the reference to eligibility period, therefore, should be omitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that these comments reflect an incorrect view of the 1981 Amendments and the effect of the
1988 Amendments in the OTCA. The Department construes the 1981 Amendments as setting the beginning of the eligibility
period as the week immediately following the week in which regular benefits are exhausted following the worker's
first qualifying separation. This is explicitly provided for in section 233(a)(2), as amended in 1981, and is set
forth in the Department's regulations implementing the 1981 Amendments. The only change in this provision of the
law was the extension of the eligibility period from 52 weeks to 104 weeks in the 1986 Amendments. No change was made
in the fixed eligibility period until the 1988 Amendments, which restored the movable eligibility period based on
the most recent qualifying total separation. Therefore, in &sect;617.3(m)(1), the fixed eligibility period is
retained for first qualifying separations that occurred before August 23, 1988. The new movable eligibility period
is also implemented, in accordance with the 1988 Amendments, for decisions made on or after August 23, 1988, for other
qualifying total separations which occurred before, on, or after August 23, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1430(g) of the OTCA provides for the retention of the pre-OTCA eligibility period which was established by
the first qualifying separation occurring before August 23, 1988, even if the decision is made on or after August 23,
1988. Amended section 233(a)(2) may not be applied in a decision made on or after August 23, 1988, in the case of a more
recent total separation occurring before August 23, 1988, if the effect of applying such amended section would result
in an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period established on the basis of an earlier first qualifying separation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is essential to retain the definition of eligibility period for the application of prior law with respect to first
qualifying separations which occurred before August 23, 1988, while adding a definition of the new eligibility period
for qualifying separations to which amended section 233(a)(2) is applicable. If, however, the adversely affected
worker is totally separated on or after August 23, 1988, following a first qualifying separation which occurred prior
to August 23, 1988, amended section 233(a)(2) must be applied even though it results in an earlier expiration date
of the eligibility period established under pre-OTCA law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, no substantive change is made in paragraph (m)(1)(i) of &sect;617.3, but as noted below substantive changes
are made in paragraphs (m) and (t) as a result of the new interpretations of sections 1430 (a) and (g) of the OTCA, and
to correct technical errors.

Application of new eligibility period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The UAW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commented that in &sect;617.3(m)(1) the Department set up two standards for the 104-week eligibility period during
which TRA is payable. The UAW argues that the proposed two standards differ according to whether the date of separation
occurred before or after August 23, 1988. The UAW commented that Congress explicitly provided in section 1430(g)
of the OTCA that the revised definition of the 104-week eligibility period in section 1425(a) (amending section 233(a)(2))
was effective upon enactment unless the application of the amended eligibility period would reduce the period for
which a worker would have been eligible for TRA. Therefore, the two standards should not turn on the date of the worker's
separation, but on whether or not the worker's period of eligibility is reduced through the application of the amended
eligibility period. The UAW commented further that Congress intended the amendment to be fully effective upon enactment,
permitting the amendment to increase the eligibility period for basic TRA or establish a TRA eligibility period for
some workers, and noted that the Conference agreement statements in House Conference Report 100&hyph;576 on sections
1425 and 1430 of the OTCA strongly support this application of the amendments. The UAW also commented that under OTCA
sections 1425(a) and 1430(g) the most recent total separation which is qualifying must be used to determine the eligibility
period, unless the eligibility period would be shortened through the application of the amendment to workers separated
prior to enactment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDLI, commenting on the transition guidelines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.67(e)(3), noted that section 1430(g), in specifically referring to total separations prior to the enactment
of the OTCA, raised the unavoidable implication that amended section 233(a)(2) shall be applied to total separations
prior to August 23, 1988, if such application would provide the worker with a longer or later eligibility period than
the worker would have had under the pre-OTCA law. The Unemployment Council of Southwestern Pennsylvania made the
same point in its comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees with the commenters' understanding that the amendment to the basic TRA eligibility period
is not to operate to the disadvantage of workers whose eligibility period would expire at a later date with respect
to a qualifying separation which occurred before the date of enactment of the amendment to section 233(a)(2). These
comments were also a factor in the Department's reconsideration of GAL 7&hyph;88 and the resulting new interpretations
of sections 1430(a) and 1430(g) announced in GAL 15&hyph;90 (see discussion in item A. above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If workers are to retain the advantage of a later expiration date for the eligibility period based on the prior law,
then the prior law must continue to be applied to first qualifying separations which occur before the date of enactment
of the OTCA (August 23, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in general the comments have merit, and substantial changes are made in the final regulations regarding
the definition of ``eligibility period'' in &sect;617.3(m)(1) and the definitions of ``separations'' in &sect;617.3(t).
Furthermore, the transition provisions at &sect;617.67(e) also have been revised to reflect the Department's new
interpretations of sections 1430(a) and 1430(g). For further clarification, a proviso directly implementing section
1430(g) of the OTCA is added to &sect;617.3(m)(1).

The PDLI stated that &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) does not clearly point out why weeks of training prior to approval cannot
be paid. The PDLI asked ``What if the trainee, for example, was in JTPA funded training that would be, after approval,
either paid for by TAA or continued under JTPA?''

Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This comment suggests a misunderstanding of the TAA program and the effects of the 1988 Amendments and earlier changes.
Since the addition of section 236(a)(3) (now 236(a)(4)) in the 1986 Amendments, the switching of training costs from
other funds to TAA funds has to be subject to the controls set out in that section. In the 1988 Amendments those controls
were retained, and authority was added to mix TAA funding with funding from other public and private sources and to
use funding solely from other sources for TAA training. That is why, in GAL 15&hyph;90 (and earlier in GAL 7&hyph;88)
and in amended &sect;617.25, greater emphasis is given to entering into prearrangements for sharing the costs of
training with other funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. With training becoming an eligibility requirement for basic TRA in the 1988 Amendments, the same emphasis
upon prospective treatment must now be given to basic TRA as has been given to additional TRA and, to a somewhat lesser
extent, TAA funds for training. Additional TRA has not been paid for retroactive weeks, nor, under &sect;617.22(c),
have previously incurred training costs been payable from TAA funds. This same rule must now be applied to basic TRA,
as well as additional TRA and TAA training funds, and it is this rule that is reflected in amended &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii)
as well as in amended &sect;617.22(c). Under the 1988 Amendments, therefore, TAA funding will not follow automatically
from approval of training under &sect;617.22(a), nor will approval of training that commenced before approval under
&sect;617.22(a) imply or justify payment of previously incurred training costs from TAA funds, or payment of any
TRA for any week that ended before such approval was documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, no substantive change is made in the final regulations to accord with PDLI's comment. Changes
are made in &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii), as well as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(c), however, for purposes of stating the prospective rule as clearly as possible and to furnish a regulatory
response to the PDLI's multi-faceted question.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retroactive payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (OBES) commented that &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) specifies that the eligibility
period, during which additional weeks of TRA are payable to a worker in approved training, if such training is approved
after the training commences, begins with the first week such training is approved. Approval of such training after
the training has commenced shall not be deemed to authorize the payment of TRA for any week which ended before such approval
was documented. The OBES explained that, at the present time, many individuals are enrolled in training programs
which were not TAA approvable prior to the 1988 Amendments because the costs of training were paid with non-appropriated
funds. While these individuals are being made aware of the change in the law that now authorizes the use of non-appropriated
funds to pay the costs of training, there are unavoidable delays in documenting sources of training funds and approving
the training under part 617. These delays result in lost worker eligibility for weeks of additional TRA. OBES recommends
that the final rule provide for retroactive payment of the additional weeks of TRA in such cases, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least to the date of application for approval of such training. Sections 617.22(c) and 617.67(f) would also need to
be modified for this purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OBES presented the problem as one that existed at the time the letter was written; that is, when the OBES's comments
were made in December 1988. Although the Department understands that such a problem may have existed in late August
and in September 1988, the operating instructions in GAL 7&hyph;88 were issued to State agencies some three months
before the OBES comments were made. Accordingly, the Department has decided not to relax its long-standing rule against
retroactive payments expressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(c). See discussion under the preceding item. It was not expected that the new authorization for sharing
costs of training would furnish a viable solution to all existing cases. One of the safeguards built into the new system
was to require that sharing of costs be under conditions arranged before the training was approved under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22 and undertaken by the worker. There is no intent to approve the payment of additional TRA for weeks a worker
is not actually participating in training nor to approve retroactive payments that are not allowable under &sect;617.22
(c). The expectation is that cooperating agencies will enter into shared cost prearrangements for training not funded
wholly from TAA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department has decided to make no change in the regulations in response to this comment, but notes under
item 3 that clarifying technical changes are being made in &sect;&sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) and 617.22(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifying separations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (MDLIR) commented on paragraphs (t)(1), (t)(2)(ii) and
(t)(3)(ii) of &sect;617.3 in the proposed rule, which define ``first separation'', ``qualifying separation'',
and ``first qualifying separation''. Since a worker must have a total separation on or after August 23, 1988 to qualify
for TRA, the MDLIR asked why the definition of ``partial separation'' should not be eliminated if it takes a total separation
to establish eligibility for TRA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department retained the definition of ``partial separation'' because the qualifying requirements in section
231(a)(1) and (2) continue to permit workers to have a total or partial separation from employment to qualify for TRA
prior to August 23, 1988, and for TAA services other than TRA whether a separation occurs before or after August 23,
1988. The amended law does not require that a worker have a total qualifying separation on or after August 23, 1988,
in order to qualify for basic or additional TRA for weeks beginning after August 23, 1988. Workers will continue to
be eligible for basic and additional TRA after August 23, 1988, based on a partial or total qualifying separation that
occurred before August 23 under the prior law. Although the amended law requires that a qualifying separation must
be a total separation to qualify initially for basic TRA (or to move the eligibility period based on a prior qualifying
separation under the same certification), a partial qualifying separation will be used for purposes other than the
basic TRA eligibility period. For example, under &sect;617.15(b) an application for training must be filed within
210 days after the date of the worker's total or partial separation referred to in Section 231(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1). (See item E. above, and item 25, below, concerning changes to &sect;617.15(b) on the application of the 210-day
rule.) Further, the weekly and maximum amounts of TRA payable to an individual are based on the first total or partial
separation. However, with respect to qualifying separations to which amended section 233(a)(2) applies, a worker's
eligibility period for basic TRA is based on total separations only.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering this comment, however, an error was discovered in paragraph (t)(3) of &sect;617.3, which did not give
proper effect to a partial separation on or after August 23, 1988. Therefore, in addition to other changes as discussed
above, paragraph (t)(3) is amended in this final rule to accord with the above response to this comment. For the same
reason a parallel change is made in &sect;617.67(e)(4).

TRA weekly and maximum. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In commenting on the application of amended section 233(a)(2) to the most recent total qualifying separation, in
determining the eligibility period of a worker, the UAW argued that this contrasts with the determination of weekly
and maximum amounts of TRA, which does require the use of ``first qualifying separation.'' The proper use of ``first
qualifying separation'' is restricted to the determination of the weekly and maximum amounts of TRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that determinations of TRA weekly benefit amounts and maximum benefit amounts, under sections
232(a) and 233(a)(1), will continue to be based on the first total or partial separation, and that this was not changed
by the 1988 Amendments. What this means is that monetary determinations of TRA entitlement may have to be based upon
two separations which occurred in different years. For example, for a period of up to three years or more after August
23, 1988 (the impact date to termination date of a certification plus the time between petition and certification
dates can be a period of up to or in excess of three years), it is possible that a worker will have had a first qualifying
separation before August 23, 1988, and computations under sections 232(a) and 233(a)(1) will be based upon UI entitlement
in the first benefit period following such first separation, whereas the worker's most recent total qualifying separation
will be used to determine the basic TRA eligibility period. This is simply illustrative, however, because in all cases
decided on or after August 23, 1988, the eligibility period under amended section 233(a)(2) will be based upon the
most recent ``total qualifying separation,'' whereas computations of weekly and maximum TRA amounts under sections
232(a) and 233(a)(1) will continue to be based on the first separation with respect to which the worker is entitled
to UI, whether such separation occurred before or after August 23, 1988. This is an additional reason why, for any worker
who is determined to have had a ``total qualifying separation,'' it will be necessary to establish whether the worker
had an earlier first separation under the same certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``first qualifying separation'' in paragraph (t)(3) of &sect;617.3 incorrectly relates determinations
of weekly and maximum TRA amounts only to first qualifying separations with respect to which the worker also qualifies
for TRA. This is corrected in the final regulations, and other technical corrections are made to distinguish between
``first separation'' and the meaning of ``first qualifying separation'' for its two purposes; that is, (a) eligibility
period for TRA, and (b) computation of weekly and maximum TRA amounts.

Partial separations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indiana Department of Employment and Training Services (IDETS) commented that, based on its understanding of
&sect;617.3(t)(3)(ii) of the proposed rule, and sections 233(a)(1) and 231(a)(3)(A) of the Act, there appears to
be a conflict over whether a partial separation after August 23, 1988, may be used to determine benefit amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IDETS is correct in noting this error in paragraph (t)(3) of &sect;617.3. See the discussion under the preceding
two items. The first separation under a single certification, with respect to which the worker is entitled to UI, must
be used to determine the worker's weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA, whether such first separation occurs before
or after August 23, 1988. As noted in the preceding two items, &sect;617.3(t) is modified to clarify this and other
points.

Advice to workers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Vermont Department of Employment and Training (VDET) commented on &sect;617.4 concerning what constitutes
proper advice and assistance to workers. The VDET stated that the requirement to inform each worker applying for unemployment
insurance ``of the procedures and deadlines for applying for such benefits'' taken literally includes a large number
of applicants who are applying for short term UI benefits and who in no way are likely to be eligible for benefits under
the TAA program. The VDET argues that while it is important that the State agency take the initiative to inform workers
who may be eligible for the benefits, the current language is too rigid, and will only cause confusion among short term
unemployed. The Vermont agency recommended that the requirement be rephrased to require States to develop the means
to identify trade eligible workers who apply for UI and then provide the necessary information to those workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that State agencies should identify potential trade eligible workers as early as possible
in their benefit period. However, section 239(f) of the Act provides, among other things, that each worker who applies
for unemployment insurance shall be advised of the benefits under the TAA provisions of the Trade Act and the procedures
and deadlines to apply for such benefits. There is no language which would support the limitation suggested by the
VDET. Often temporary layoffs by a firm adversely affected by import competition or other economic conditions become
permanent. The intent of Congress is to ensure that such workers are made aware early in their unemployment experience
of the TAA program, how to apply for benefits, and the services available to them. Many State UI agencies furnish an
information bulletin or brochure to every worker who files a claim for UI. These bulletins or brochures should include
full and correct information on the amended TAA program, and on the benefits and services available to unemployed
workers. The Department is encouraging all State agencies to publish a brochure for handout to workers filing initial
claims for UI. State agencies should revise their previously used brochures to accurately reflect all the changes
made in this final rule, and furnish a copy to each worker who files an initial claim for UI as required by section 239(f)
since August 23, 1988.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While no change is made in the final regulations regarding the requirement of advising all UI claimants of the TAA program,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice to workers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Michigan Employment Security Commission (MESC) explained that &sect;617.4(d)(1)(ii)(A) states that notices
to workers must include information as to the article(s) produced. The MESC commented that unless the article(s)
produced is part of the certification statement, e.g. ``all workers producing shock absorbers,'' referring to it
will often confuse rather than clarify worker coverage. For example, if the certification covers ``all workers of
XYZ Company,'' to state in the worker notice that the company ``produces shock absorbers,'' will confuse workers
of the XYZ Company who may have produced brakes. Unless a specific article is identified in the published certification
document, it should not be required information in the notice to workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department concurs with the comment. The articles produced are to be specified in a notice to the workers only when
there is a specific reference in the published certification document to an article or articles. When all workers
in the firm are covered by the certification it is not necessary to identify the article(s) produced. The regulation
is modified at &sect;617.4(d)(1)(ii)(A) to reflect this change, and the same change is made in &sect;617.4(d)(2)(ii)(A)
regarding newspaper notices.

Identifying workers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The New York Department of Labor (NYDL) commented that &sect;617.4(d)(1) expands the intent of the Trade Act by specifying
the sources that the State agency should utilize in identifying adversely affected workers. The NYDL stated that
it is inappropriate to specify such sources in a regulation and suggested that the Department adhere to the language
of the Act. It also suggested the following substitute language: ``The state agency shall provide written notice,
through the mail, of benefits available under this chapter to each worker whom the State agency has reason to believe
is covered by a certification made under subchapter A of this chapter. The notice must include the following information:
*&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule merely refers to any other reliable sources of information other than the workers' firm. When a firm
closes, information from the firm's records may be difficult to obtain. In this case, as well as others, the State agency
should obtain the best information available to it. This level of specificity seems appropriate for the regulations.
Similarly, in implementing the provision on the scope of the notice to be given, the Department has concluded that
amended Section 225 requires that all workers who can be identified shall receive such notice. Therefore, no change
is made in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Newspaper notices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OBES commented that &sect;617.4(d)(2) requires State agencies to publish a notice of each certification issued
in its State in a newspaper of general circulation in the areas in which the affected workers reside. OBES further commented
that it is not uncommon that prior to the State agency being informed of a certification by the Department of Labor all
affected workers have already learned of the certification and have reported to the State agency to file for TAA benefits.
Therefore, OBES recommended that the final rule provide for a waiver of the public notice requirement when it can be
verified by the State agency that all the affected workers have filed for TAA benefits. The OBES also recommended that
the funding source for such newspaper notices be identified formally. The California Employment Development Department
(CEDD) provided similar comments on &sect;617.4(d)(2). CEDD pointed out that there is no useful purpose in placing
an expensive newspaper ad when all affected workers are notified by letter, or when the ad will very likely not be seen
by any of the former workers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that a newspaper notice is not needed in some situations because all the workers are identified
by the State agency and notified by mail. This situation occurs frequently when the certified worker group is small.
Therefore, the Department is amending the final rule at &sect;617.4(d)(2) to authorize State agencies to dispense
with the newspaper notice when it can be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and is

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
documented
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

a waiver of the training requirement and the procedure for doing so.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that the regulations as proposed establish the right of workers to waivers of the training
requirement in appropriate cases, and provide for appeal and review of determinations on such waivers. State agencies
will initiate waivers where training is not feasible or appropriate. Information that waivers will be issued to workers
when training is not appropriate or feasible must be furnished to the workers or be included in the bulletin or brochure
furnished to each worker under paragraph (e)(1) of &sect;617.4. The Department does not believe that more specificity
is required in paragraph (e)(1). Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations.

 The CEDD, commenting on &sect;617.4(e), stated that there is some confusion between this section and &sect;617.67(c)(2).
The CEDD commented that it is not clear whether TAA information must be provided to every individual who applies for
unemployment insurance, as stated in &sect;617.67(c)(2), or just to those certified as adversely affected as implied
by use of the word ``worker'' in &sect;617.4(e). The CEDD recommended, if States are to provide TAA information to
all individuals filing for UI, this requirement should be clearly identified in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not believe that the regulations are ambiguous on this issue. The 1988 Amendments to section 239(f)
state that every worker filing for UI is to be informed of the TAA program and the benefits available, even though the
worker may not qualify for TAA. The regulations at &sect;&sect;617.4(e)(1) and 617.67(c)(2) clearly state that
each worker who applies for UI shall be advised of the benefits available under the TAA program and does not confine
such advice to workers who have been identified as adversely affected by imports. Therefore, no change is made in the
regulations.

 The OBES commented that &sect;617.4(e)(1) requires State agencies to advise each worker who files for unemployment
insurance of TAA benefits available and the deadlines for applying for such benefits. The OBES requested that the
final rule replace the term ``deadlines'' with ``time limits''. The final rule should also establish the administrative
funding mechanism for the substantial costs associated with implementing this requirement. CEDD also commented
on a funding issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations at &sect;617.4(e)(1) track the language of section 239(f)(1) of the Trade Act, which provides that
workers shall be informed of the ``deadlines'' for applying for TAA benefits. Matters of administrative funding
are addressed in program letters and other issuances of the Department and will be addressed further in &sect;617.60
when it is published. (See explanation on the publication of &sect;617.60 in item Q. above.) No special funding category
is contemplated for furnishing information and assistance to applicants and potential applicants. Therefore,
no change is made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CEDD, commenting on &sect;617.10(d), stated that this section contains a statement about providing ``workers''
with TAA information at the time the UI claim is filed. The CEDD argues that, if the rule means every individual who files

when the worker files an initial UI claim.

Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1988 Amendments require the State agency to inform every worker filing an initial UI claim about the TAA program
and the benefits available under it. There are no exceptions to this rule. One of the purposes of the amendment is to
ensure that workers are informed of the program at that time so they can file a petition for TAA if they wish, whether
or not a petition has been filed or a certification issued covering that worker or others. See &sect;617.4(e). The
Department believes this requirement can be met easily by furnishing an information bulletin or brochure on the TAA
program to every worker who files an initial UI claim. See discussion in item 8, above. Therefore, no change is made
in the final regulations.

Legal work requirement.

 The UAW commented that the proposed rules at &sect;617.11(a)(1)(iii)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(C) are not reflected in
any provision of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, nor in the 1988 Amendments. The UAW stated that the Department is
trying to enforce the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) with this provision. The UAW argued that if Congress
wished to enact such a provision it could have, but it did not do so. IRCA did not implicitly amend other federal laws.
The Department should not amend the TAA program to enforce IRCA in the absence of statutory authority and therefore
the referenced subparagraphs should be deleted entirely.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 The content of &sect;&sect;617.11(a)(1)(iii)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(C) is not changed by reason of the 1988 Amendments.
These sections of the regulations merely restate a requirement which has been in the TAA regulations since they were
issued in 1975 in a different place within the regulations. No substantive change has been made in this regulatory
requirement. These provisions do not implement the IRCA. Therefore, no change is made to the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NYDL recommended that &sect;617.11(a)(1)(vii) on the job search program (JSP) be deleted from the regulations
since retroactive TRA claims approved for weeks prior to November 21, 1988, will no longer require participation
in a JSP. After November 21, 1988, individuals involved will not know about the requirement. The UAW made a similar
comment on the JSP requirement. However, the UAW commented further that this proposed rule creates a likelihood that
workers will not be informed by State agencies of the deletion of this requirement in the 1988 Amendments since the
Department is ``encouraging'' States to continue the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Various provisions of the 1988 Amendments became effective on different dates. The proposed rule was structured
to address those statutory requirements that applied prior to, and apply on and after November 21, 1988. The JSP requirement
was applicable through November 20, 1988. The training requirement became applicable on November 21, 1988. Therefore,
it is essential to delineate the statutory requirements for each time period, and set them forth clearly in these regulations.
Also, appeal actions may be pending on workers who were denied TRA eligibility because they failed to begin participation
in or failed to complete a JSP. Some of these cases could eventually be resolved in the courts. The retention of the regulations
on the JSP will continue to provide the basis for supporting determinations made by State agencies during the period
the JSP requirement was applicable. In the proposed rule, a new paragraph was added to &sect;617.49, specifically
providing that JSP is not a requirement for any week which begins after November 20, 1988, and this provision is included
in the final regulations. In addition, the Department believes that a JSP is a very useful employability service for
adversely affected workers and should be encouraged. Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OBES commented that &sect;617.11(a)(3)(iii) specifies that State agencies are to take into account local labor
market characteristics in giving effect to the terms seasonal employment and part-time, temporary work. The OBES
recommended that the final rule should provide a definition of temporary work to ensure uniformity among and between
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted in item D. above, the Department decided to add to the regulations definitions of the terms ``seasonal employment'',
``odd jobs'', and ``part-time, temporary employment'', to provide State agencies with guiding instructions for
implementing section 1426(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the OTCA, so that the Department, rather than the States, defines the
limits of Federal liability under &sect;617.11(a)(3) as under other aspects of the TAA program. The explanation
for each of these definitions is noted in item D. In more specific response to the commenter, notice that the definitions
go beyond simply defining temporary work separate and apart from ``part-time, temporary employment'' as used in
the statute. To fit into this category, as is made clear in the amended regulation, such work must be both part-time
and temporary.

Enrolled in training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Governor of North Dakota and the Job Service of North Dakota, commenting on &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii), point out
that the definition for ``enrolled into training'' is when the worker has been accepted to an approved training program
that will begin within 30 calendar days. Both recommended that the definition provide that a worker be considered
as enrolled in training upon acceptance into an approved training program and scheduled to commence training on the
next regularly scheduled program starting date. Rural States have a limited number of training facilities offering
open entry and open exit options. Virtually all training programs offered by both public and private facilities have
designated enrollment dates. The 30-day limitation would cause States to invoke the waiver provision unnecessarily.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department included the 30-day provision in the definition for ``Enrolled in training'' to help reduce the number
of waivers of the training requirement that would have to be issued by State administering agencies because approved
training would not begin immediately. The Department recognizes that schedules for some training institutions
may involve periods longer than 30 days for training to begin. In such situations, a waiver may and should be granted.
States must search for training programs for individuals which will begin within 30 days, or as soon as possible thereafter.
To allow fewer days in the definition for ``Enrolled in training'' would generate more waivers of the training requirement
and increase administrative costs. The Department believes that extending this period in regulations would be difficult
to justify. Under the statute, the objective of the training requirement is to get workers actively engaged in training
as soon as possible, as a condition of entitlement to TRA. The 30-day requirement eliminates the need for a waiver where
the training program is to begin within 30 days, but does not subject the worker to the EB work test while awaiting the
start of training. Accordingly, no change is made in the final regulations.

 The MDLIR commented that &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vi)(B) and (vii)(B) and (C), which refer to the EB work test and the training
requirement, appear to be contradictory. The regulations state that the EB work test and the training requirement
shall not apply to an individual with respect to a claim for TRA for weeks of unemployment prior to the filing of an initial
claim for TRA, nor for any week which begins before the certification is issued and the individual is fully informed
of the requirement. The MDLIR points out that the language of these paragraphs appears to permit retroactive payments
of TRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not agree with the commenter. The cited paragraphs of the regulations do not authorize retroactive
payments of TRA. These paragraphs specifically provide that the requirements for eligibility in clauses (vi) and
(vii) may not be applied retroactively, to workers otherwise eligible for basic TRA, because workers cannot comply
retroactively with those requirements. This is a ``due process'' issue only. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), stated that the requirement ``the training occurred subsequent to the individual's total or partial separation''
goes beyond Congressional intent. The UCSP argues that in amended Section 231(a)(5)(B) Congress allowed TRA payments
to workers who have ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;after the date on which the worker became totally separated, or partially
separated, from adversely affected employment, completed a training program approved by the Secretary.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), recommended that the definition for ``enrolled in training'' be amended by adding after ``within 30 calendar days''
the words ``or the next available time the training could begin at the training institution.'' The WESD explained
that in the cases where training is not available within 30 days of approval that to subject the worker to the EB work
test, which means a worker must accept any work the worker is physically capable of performing, would be to the detriment
of the worker when training is approved and planned for in the foreseeable future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the period the EB work test is applied under &sect;617.19(b)(3), when the training requirement is waived,
the worker may find suitable employment which would eliminate the need for additional training. If the State agency
determines the job is not suitable (as defined in &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii)), and it is reasonable and necessary for
the worker to quit work in order to enter training, as provided in &sect;617.18(b)(1)(iii), the individual may enter
training when the training program begins. Also, see the Department's response in item 20, above. Therefore, no change
is made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certain waivers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PDLI commented that &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(C) appears to require that a worker must meet all the requirements
applicable to eligibility for basic TRA in the preceding sections, including the wage and employment qualifying
requirements, with respect to the total separation in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(B), to qualify for the waiver of the
basic TRA eligibility period and the 210-day filing requirement under Section 1425(b) of the OTCA. The PDLI commented
further that the reference in Section 1425(b) is to total separations from adversely affected employment within
the meaning of Section 247 of the Act. Section 247 defines both separation and adversely affected employment. The
definitions do not include references to wage and employment qualifying requirements. Requiring workers to meet
these additional conditions with respect to the total separation noted in section 1425(b) seems to be beyond the intent
of the law. Further, to the extent previous Federal operating instructions (GAL 7&hyph;88) direct the wage requirements,
including equivalent qualifying weeks, be met as provided under the law prior to the 1986 Amendments, the PDLI believes
those instructions are incorrect and should be revised.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not concur in these comments. Section 1425(b) does not remove the wage and employment qualifying
requirements of the Trade Act. This section, by specific reference to sections 233(a)(2) and 233(b), only eliminates
the time limit on the eligibility period for receiving basic TRA and the 210-day time limit for filing for training
to qualify for additional weeks of TRA. No waiver of any of the other basic eligibility requirements is implied in removing
these two time constraints. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations.

The WESD, commenting on &sect;617.15(b)(2), argues that it would be a contradiction for the Department to retain
the present 210-day requirement for requesting training in order to qualify for additional weeks of TRA rather than
applying a movable eligibility period as used for TRA payments. The NJDL and the MESC also commented that the 210-day
period should begin with the individual's most recent qualifying separation.

The Department agrees with these comments, and &sect;617.15(b) is revised accordingly in the final rule. This change
has already been implemented through Change 2 to GAL 7&hyph;88 and reiterated in GAL 15&hyph;90, both of which were
also previously published as notices in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This change is effective for decisions made on or after August 23, 1988, when the movable eligibility period took

Scheduled breaks in training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The UAW, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(1), pointed out that amended section 233(f) provides that a worker shall
be treated as participating in training during a week which falls in a break of 14 days or less, if the worker was participating
in training before the break and ``the break is provided under such training program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UAW points out that the proposed rule adds the requirement that the break be ``provided in the published schedule
of the training program.'' While ``publication'' might ease administration, there are some individualized training
programs which do not have published schedules. Therefore, the UAW recommended that ``previously established''
schedule as an alternative formulation which would permit workers in less academic settings to continue to receive
TRA as Congress intended, but prevent nonparticipating workers from arguing they were merely ``on break.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not believe such a narrow reading need be given to the word ``published,'' but has clarified the
regulations by modifying &sect;617.15(d)(1) to add after the ``published schedule'' the words ``or previously
established schedule'' and by adding that the break may be indicated in the training program approved for the individual.
The intent is to ensure that ``breaks'' in training during which TRA payments may continue are not limited to regularly
scheduled breaks established by the training provider before the program begins but also include all other periods
of time elapsing between courses or phases of the approved training program. Therefore, the changes made in this final
rule with respect to this matter go beyond the comments received, and, as explained in item F. above, a new clause (2)
is added to &sect;617.15(d) to define a scheduled break in training as including scheduled breaks within or between
courses, terms, quarters, semesters, and academic years, whether or not such breaks are scheduled by the training
provider.

&sect;617.15(d)(1)(i) requires, in addition to other requirements, that the worker be participating in training
immediately prior to the break and resume participation immediately after the break ends. The PDLI recommends that
this provision might be stated better by changing the final regulation to participating in training for the week claimed
prior to the beginning of the break and resuming participation for the week claimed at the end of the break.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes the commenter's suggestion would introduce some ambiguity in the wording of the regulations.
However, &sect;617.15(d)(1) is revised to reflect the change announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, and set forth in Section
E.3., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payments of TRA During Breaks in Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90. Section 233(f) provides for the payment of basic and additional TRA ``during any
week which is part of a break in training'' provided certain conditions are met. The conditions are spelled out in &sect;617.15(d)(1),
clauses (i) through (iii). In addition, as a condition of TRA eligibility during the break, &sect;617.15(d)(1) is
amended to restate the requirement that the worker shall be required to participate in training after the break ends.
This will assure that the purpose of Section 233(f) is carried out. Section 617.15(d)(1) accordingly is modified
by removing the ``resume participation'' condition from clause (i) and restating it in clause (iii), with emphasis
upon ``immediate'' resumption of participation.

The ODHR, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(1)(i), explains that by including the phrase ``and resumes participation''
as a condition for payment means that no payment for the break can be paid until the break is over and this is verified.
The ODHR states that this contradicts the intent of the rule that ``An individual will continue to receive basic and
additional weeks of TRA during scheduled breaks in training'' and would create problems if the break fell within the
individual's scheduled reporting period. The NYDL provided similar comments on &sect;617.15(d)(1)(i).

The Department agrees that it is not the intent of this regulation to delay TRA payments during scheduled breaks in
training that do not exceed 14 days. However, if a worker fails to resume participation in the training immediately
after the break ends, any payments made during the scheduled break shall be established as overpayments, subject
to repayment under the provisions of &sect;617.55. Therefore, no change in the regulations is necessary to reflect
this intent.

The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(2), stated that no basic TRA may be paid if the individual is on a scheduled
training break of 15 days or more. The MESC stated that denial of TRA to a claimant during a break which exceeds 14 days,
but less than 30 days, is inconsistent with the definition of ``enrolled in training'' in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii)(D)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which allows payment of TRA to a claimant who will enter training within 30 days. A claimant during a break in training
of less than 30 days should be considered enrolled in training and eligible for basic TRA.

The purpose of these two provisions is not similar, nor is there a basis in the statute for altering the specific 14-day
provision of section 233(f). The 14-day break in training provision is a statutory requirement and not subject to
change in regulations. On the 30-day provision, see the discussion in item 20 above. Therefore, no change is made in
the final regulations.

The Department agrees that recognized legal holidays should not be counted, and has already acknowledged this change
in section E.3. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 (also see page 3 of the GAL). Ordinarily, breaks in training are oriented
to National and State holidays, and to periods within terms or semesters of the training institution. The one long
holiday oriented break each year is the holiday beginning around the second or third week in December and ending after
New Year's Day. Since these holidays are the reason for the break, the Department agrees that such holidays should
not be included in counting the number of days of the break. The critical point is whether a particular day would ordinarily
be a scheduled training day in the particular training program. Therefore, official State and National holidays
are added to the days not counted in counting the days of a break, if training in the program concerned would not normally
be scheduled on such days. (See the explanation in item F. above.)

EB work test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.17(b)(2), stated that this section indicates that on or after November 21, 1988,
claimants in training which is State approved (but not TAA approved) must satisfy the EB work test. The MESC further
states that before November 21, 1988, the EB work test was not applied to claimants in State approved training. The
MESC argues that there should be no change in the exception to the EB work test on or after November 21, 1988. Section
231(a)(4) of the Trade Act, unchanged by the 1988 Amendments, requires that to be eligible for TRA, a worker would not
be disqualified for EB due to the work test. An EB claimant in State approved training would not be disqualified.

Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter incorrectly reads section 231(a)(4) and the effect of the substantive amendment to section 231(a)(5),
which was effective on November 21, 1988. Prior to November 21, 1988, for the purposes of basic TRA, participation
in training approved under the State law or under &sect;617.22(a) was sufficient to make the able and available requirement,
including the EB work test, inapplicable. The amendment to section 231(a)(5) makes training approved under section
236 an eligibility requirement for basic TRA, effective on November 21, 1988. After November 20, therefore, claimants
for basic TRA may not satisfy the requirement of section 231(a)(5), or avoid the EB work test, by participating in training
which is not approved under section 236. The Department's position was clearly set forth in section 4.C. of GAL 7&hyph;88,
and was reiterated without change in section C. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90; it also is correctly stated in &sect;&sect;617.11(a)
(2), (3), and (4) and 617.17(b) of the proposed rule and is retained in this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To give full effect to the 1988 Amendments, moreover, the EB work test must apply even after the TRA claimant has satisfied
the requirement of Section 231(a)(5) by completing a training program approved under amended &sect;617.22(a),
(see Section C. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90). Having completed such training, the individual should be job ready,
and should be actively seeking work so as to return to employment as soon as possible. It is particularly appropriate
in these circumstances, therefore, that the EB work test of section 231(a)(4) should apply in regard to any further
claims for basic TRA. It would not accord with these purposes to permit the claimant to avoid the EB work test by engaging
in any other training that is not approved under amended &sect;617.22(a). The Department has concluded, and the final
regulations provide, therefore, that the EB work test must be met by every claimant for basic TRA, unless the claimant
actually is enrolled in or participating in TAA approved training as specified in the Trade Act and in these final regulations.
This requirement applies as well to claimants who have completed TAA approved training, with respect to any claim
for basic TRA for any week beginning after completing the training program. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), commented on &sect;617.18(b)(2)(i),
regarding an individual who ``*&blank;*&blank;* fails to make satisfactory progress in training,'' and on &sect;617.18(b)(2)(ii)(C),

Justifiable cause,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 including reasons related to the individual's capability to participate in or complete approved training. The AFL-CIO
recommends that, since educational limitations are a common reason for failure to profit from job training, such
individuals should be promptly evaluated as to the need for remedial education, as authorized under the 1988 Amendments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that training must be suitable for the worker. The fifth criterion in section 236(a)(1) requires
a supported determination that a worker is qualified to undertake and complete the training being approved. See section
G.1. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 and section 4.G.1. of GAL 7&hyph;88, and &sect;617.22(a)(5). This provision
emphasizes the worker's personal qualifications; that is, that the worker's own physical and mental capabilities
and background and experience are appropriate to the training. It states further that the worker must be evaluated
before approving training as being qualified to undertake the specific training program being considered and to
complete that training program successfully. If the worker needs remedial education, this should be identified
and included as a part of the approved training program. If, during the training program, the need for remedial education
becomes apparent, appropriate arrangements should be made to accommodate those needs as part of the same training
program. Therefore, while the Department agrees with the comment, no change is needed in the regulations to accomplish
this intent. However, the worker's personal qualifications in &sect;617.22(a)(5) are amended by adding financial
resources to the existing qualifications to undertake and complete the training being approved. Item J., above,
explains the change and the Department's reasons for the change.

Satisfactory progress in training.

The PDLI commented that several paragraphs in the proposed rule refer to ``making satisfactory progress'' in training.
This language was amended in section 233(a) of the Trade Act effec- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tive on November 21, 1988, to ``participating'' in training, and section 236(c) was repealed. The PDLI recommends
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless these sections refer to the law prior to November 21, 1988, this language only serves to confuse and should be
revised or deleted. The UCSP and UAW made similar comments on the requirement in the proposed rule that the worker must
have ``successfully'' completed an approved training program to meet the training completion requirement of amended
Section 231(a)(5).

Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has reconsidered these matters and agrees that the comments on ``satisfactory progress'' have merit.
References to ``satisfactory progress'' have therefore been removed from &sect;&sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(D), 617.15(b)(3),
617.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii), and 617.18(b)(2)(i). The references to ``successfully'' completed and ``satisfactory''
completion of training are also removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii) (A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, the conditions for ``completed training'' in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii)(D)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are retained. To meet the requirements of section 231(a)(5) of the Act, it is reasonable to expect an individual who
completed a training program to have satisfied the standards or conditions for the training program and, therefore,
to have ``successfully'' completed such training in order to be job ready. Further, in connection with making this
correction in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(D), the language is modified to make it clearer that an individual must actually
be enrolled in or participating in approved training in each week that TRA is claimed, and that, while the break in training
provisions of &sect;617.15(d) apply, the waiver of participation provisions of &sect;617.19 shall not be applicable
under paragraph (a)(3).

Waiver appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PDLI commented that &sect;617.19(a)(2) provides the minimum information that shall be contained on the waiver
of training participation. (&sect;617.19(c)(3) provides for equivalent information on the waiver revocation
form.) These minimum information items do not include an appeal date, or instructions for appeal. However, &sect;617.19(c)(4)
appears to state that waivers and waiver revocations shall be appealable. The PDLI suggests that the issuance of waivers
and waiver revocations should not be appealable determinations; rather, these documents are prerequisites to determinations
of entitlement to TRA payments, and these latter determinations should be appealable. The PDLI recommends further
evaluation of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1975 regulations required that all determinations relating to TAA program benefits shall be subject to appeal
and review, as specifically required by section 239(d) of the Trade Act of 1974. That requirement continues in effect
and is correctly implemented in the regulations in providing that &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 shall apply to all
determinations regarding waivers, as well as any determination pertaining to any other TAA program benefit. Waivers
have a direct relationship to basic TRA entitlement. The Department does not believe it would be appropriate to provide
that an individual should be denied the right to appeal a determination issued by the State agency that training is
not feasible or appropriate, or that written notice of such determinations (granting, denying, or revoking a waiver)
should not include notice of appeal rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration of the comments, however, reveals that there appears to be some lingering uncertainty about the scope
of the waiver provision and the appeal rights of individual workers, and the reexamination of the language proposed
for &sect;617.19 underscores the need for some clarification of the regulatory language so as to express the scope
of the waiver provision more accurately and to declare unmistakably the appeal and review rights of individuals in
regard to all determinations relating to waivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;617.19 thus is revised to state more accurately the scope of the waiver provision, and to
state explicitly that a waiver pertains solely to basic TRA and may never be made applicable to additional TRA. Paragraph
(a)(2) is revised so as to be more explicit about the application of the waiver provision, and to provide that waiver
determinations shall include all of the information required by &sect;617.50(e), which thereby requires inclusion
of notice of appeal rights in any such determination. This is in addition to other information specified in paragraph
(a)(2) that is required to be furnished in the determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other important changes in paragraph (a) of &sect;617.19 are the addition of clauses (3) and (4). Clause (3) is added
to make certain that denial of a waiver also is a determination to which all of the requirements for determinations
apply. Clause (4) is a restatement of the provision proposed in paragraph (c)(4), and is moved in paragraph (a) and
revised to make more explicit the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 to all determinations under paragraph (a) and to provide expressly that this means
and includes notice of appeal rights.

Waiver revocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NYDL commented on &sect;617.19(a)(2)(iv), which mandates inclusion of the statement that the ``waiver will
be revoked at any time suitable training becomes available.'' This statement would be appropriate only for waivers
issued because suitable training is not currently available; however, there are numerous situations in which training
may become available and yet a revocation of waiver would not be appropriate. Accordingly, the NYDL recommended the
following statement as more appropriate: ``This waiver is subject to review at 30 day intervals.'' This would afford
the states the needed latitude to assess the continuing validity of a waiver should training become available but
remain inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that the qualifying wording is too narrowly focused, but does not agree on affording States
the broad latitude suggested by the NYDL. Accordingly, &sect;617.19(a)(2)(iv) is revised by deleting the term ``suitable
training'' and inserting in place thereof ``appropriate and feasible training'' as provided in amended section
231(c)(2) of the Act.

 The UAW commented that &sect;617.19(b)(2)(i) as drafted should be of substantial assistance to State agencies in
administering this provision. The UAW suggested that, for clarity, the Department repeat the criteria that ``the
worker is so situated as to be able to take full advantage of the training'' at this point in the rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that &sect;617.19(b)(2) adequately covers the reasons for issuing a waiver when training
is not feasible or appropriate. The UAW's point is covered under the criteria for approval of training. Therefore,
no change is made in the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nebraska Department of Labor (NDL) commented that &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B) indicates that a course of training
is not appropriate if the duration of training exceeds the individual's maximum entitlement to TRA payments. This
would seem to limit appropriate training to a duration of 52 weeks when initial UI eligibility is 26 weeks. If this is
the actual effect, it ignores the fact that an individual may enter training during the initial UI benefit period.
When the individual enters training during the UI eligibility period, a training program of up to 78 weeks might be
completed before exhausting TRA benefits. It seems further to preclude the possibility for an individual who enters
training during the first 13 weeks of UI to be eligible for needs based payments under EDWAA during the portion of a training
period which might extend beyond the end of TRA eligibility. If this section in fact has these effects, they may be unintended,
and should perhaps be reconsidered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The TAA provisions of the Trade Act authorize the State to approve training for a worker for up to 104 weeks; however,
the maximum combined duration of UI and TRA payments generally is 78 weeks. If a training program longer than the worker's
remaining eligibility for UI and TRA payments is being considered, the State administering agency should ensure
that the individual has the financial resources to complete the training program after TRA payments expire. If such
an assurance cannot be made, a training program of shorter duration should be considered for approval. The Department
therefore agrees that the regulation is too strictly worded, and &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B) is clarified in these
final regulations. (See discussion in item J. above, on Revision of &sect;617.22(a)(5).)

Reasons for waiver.

 The VDET, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(C), concerning reasons for issuing a waiver, asked why, after 26 weeks of UI, a person with
skills for suitable employment has not become reemployed already. Simply allowing a waiver to be granted at this point
in a person's unemployment seems to be at odds with the intent of all of the recently enacted Federal retraining legislation,
and may actually exacerbate a situation where the worker has not been receiving the proper services which would result
in new employment. The VDET recognized that there may be some circumstances where it would be unfair to the worker not
to receive a waiver based on this condition. However, the VDET recommended making this condition an extreme one, by
not specifically identifying it as a reason to grant a waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that waivers should only be issued on a limited basis. As reflected in the VDET comment, however,
there may be situations where such waivers are properly warranted. For example, when a firm agrees to employ a worker
in the foreseeable future, no purpose would be served by having the worker enter training to learn other occupational
skills. Therefore, the Department sees no need to make any change in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.19(c)(1) be deleted as an unnecessary guideline with which compliance could be impossible. The OBES presented
similar comments that the final rule should reflect administrative and logistical realities by specifying such
period for waiver review to be 60 days. Basic TRA payments should be made once a waiver has been issued until such time
as the waiver is revoked, and not require documentation of such waiver reviews on an ongoing or routine basis. The CEDD
also recommended that the frequency of waiver reviews be changed to 60 days. The MESC recommended that waivers be reviewed
every 90 days, while the ODHR recommended that the State have more flexibility in the frequency for reviewing waivers.
The NJDL recommended that States be given authority to establish procedures for reviewing appropriate waivers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A major objective of the 1988 Amendments is to enroll adversely affected workers in training programs to help facilitate
their return to employment as quickly as possible. The Department believes that, when the training requirement is
waived for an individual, proper program administration necessitates regular reviews of waivers issued by the State
agencies. The frequency of such reviews at 30-day intervals is reasonable to carry out the provision requiring adversely
affected workers to be enrolled in training for purposes of receiving TRA, particularly in light of the fact that TRA
is a weekly benefit program and the 30-day rule only requires review approximately every four weeks. Section 231(c)(2)(B)
provides that ``If, after submitting to a worker a written statement *&blank;*&blank;* a State or State agency finds
that it is feasible or appropriate to approve a training program for such worker pursuant to the requirements of section
236(a), the State or State agency shall submit to such worker *&blank;*&blank;* a written statement that revokes
the certification *&blank;*&blank;*.'' To review waivers less frequently than every 30 days would not give the sense
of urgency reflected in the law on placing adversely affected workers into training programs as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the comments highlight an omission in the regulations, in that, in individual cases, when circumstances
change, the need to revoke a waiver may arise earlier than the next periodic review, and, accordingly, necessitate
action to revoke the certification before the next review date. Therefore, &sect;617.19(c)(2) is amended to require
revocation in individual cases at any time a change in circumstances occurs.

Waiver determinations appealable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.19(c)(4), stated that waiver actions should not be appealable determinations.
If training is being denied, the denial and any appeal should come on the training determination, not on the waiver.
Otherwise, duplicative appeals and confusion of issues will result. The waiver form should contain an explanatory
statement, such as: ``If you disagree with this waiver action, you have the right to appeal any denial of training or
trade readjustment allowances (TRA) that results from this action.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 See discussion under item 34, above. A determination on the feasibility and appropriateness of training, and the
reason(s) therefor, constitutes the critical determination on whether a worker is subject to the EB work test regarding
claims for basic TRA. Equally important is the relevance of a waiver in some cases. For example, a waiver is not appropriate
concerning entitlement to additional TRA, because additional TRA is payable only while the worker is actually participating
in training, and, in that case, the EB work test is not applicable. Similarly, a waiver is not appropriate during breaks
in training. It is not needed if the break is not more than 14 days. A waiver is not appropriate if the break is more than
14 days, since payment of basic or additional TRA in this case would be inconsistent with sections 231(a)(5), 233(a)(3),
and 233(f). It is clear, therefore, that the determination resulting in the issuance, denial or revocation of a waiver
presents justiciable issues, and, accordingly, determinations relating to waivers must be subject to the right
of appeal and review. To deny the right of appeal and review on justiciable issues cannot be justified. Paragraph (c)(4)
of &sect;617.19, therefore, has a sound basis in law, and is unchanged in the final rule.

(1) track the language of section 231(c)(3) of the Trade Act, which provides that the Secretary shall submit an annual
report to Congress on the number of waivers issued and the number revoked. As explained in item 14 above, matters concerning
the administrative funding for all TAA activities are addressed in program letters and other issuances of the Department
and will be addressed further in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.60 when it is published. No special funding category is contemplated for this item. Therefore, no change
is made in the final regulations.

Reemployment plans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NYDL commented that to require monthly reviews of individual reemployment plans, as implied in &sect;617.20(b)(13),
would not serve the worker in a constructive way, and to interview every adversely affected worker needlessly would
place an unreasonable burden on the agency when there is a minimum amount of funds available for staff costs. The PDLI
and the NJDL provided similar comments.

Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department concurs in the comments. It is not the Department's intent to have State agency staffs review individual
reemployment plans every 30 days, as is required for waivers of the training requirement. Therefore, the rule is modified
to provide for periodic review and updating of reemployment plans, as may be appropriate, in individual cases. The
review of waivers, which is required no less frequently than every 30 days under &sect;617.19(c)(1), is addressed
in a new clause (14) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.20(b).

Work in the ``foreseeable future''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The UAW, commenting on &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii), stated the proposed rule provides that training can be denied if
there is a reasonable prospect of suitable work within the ``foreseeable future.'' The statute does not include this
element, providing instead that there must be ``no suitable employment available'' to the adversely affected worker.
The UAW argues that under the proposed rule, a worker could be denied TRA because training was not approved due to foreseeable
work, even though the worker had no job to enter. The UCSP provided similar comments and recommended that the last part
of the rule be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This provision was incorporated in the regulations to preclude the approval of training when the worker is clearly
scheduled to be employed or recalled. For that worker, suitable employment is ``available'' if the employment may
occur in the foreseeable future. The purpose of including the provision in the rule is to give meaning to the first criterion
of section 236(a)(1) and help preserve limited training funds for use by workers who need such assistance to return
to employment. Labor-management agreements frequently provide for worker recall on a seniority basis. When recalls
are scheduled in the foreseeable future, workers clearly do not need training in order to return to employment. In
such situations, a waiver of the training requirement is appropriate and shall be issued by the State administering
agency. Therefore, no change is made in &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii) of the regulations. However, as explained in item
H. above, guidance is added in &sect;&sect;617.19 (b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A) for use by State agencies on the
application of recall that will occur in the ``reasonably foreseeable future.''

Suitable employment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The AFL-CIO, commenting on &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii), pointed out that the term ``suitable employment'' means work
at no less than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage in such adversely affected employment. Since job benefits
such as health insurance and pension entitlement must be coupled with wages to determine the total compensation of
a position, this definition should be expanded to include ``and benefits valued at not less than 80 percent of those
provided in the worker's adversely affected employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The regulation uses the definition in section 236(e), and any change such as that suggested would require a change
in the law. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adversely affected wage
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The MDLIR, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii), explained that suitable employment is defined in the proposed rule as work of a substantially
equal or higher skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment and wages for such work at not less
than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage in such adversely affected employment. The MDLIR asks why, since
there does not appear to be a change in the law, the regulation was changed from average weekly wage to average weekly
wage in adversely affected employment? In addition, the definition of average weekly wage in adversely affected
employment makes reference to partial separation which, for separations on August 23, 1988 or later, will no longer
establish TRA eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department agrees that the definition of ``average weekly wage in adversely affected employment'' is used appropriately
only in the definition of ``partial separation,'' and the definition of ``suitable work'' in section 236(e) does
not include the reference to adversely affected employment. Therefore, to fully accord with the statute, the phrase
``in such adversely affected employment'' is removed from &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii).

Training cost limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The UAW, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(b), pointed out that the Conference Committee rejected a proposed $4000 per worker limit on training
costs, stating that ``it is inappropriate to establish a ceiling on training and related costs for individual workers
since such costs may vary significantly from one region of the country to another and from one worker dislocation to
another.'' The Department cannot give the States the authority to do indirectly what the Congress decided it would
not let the Department do directly. The UAW recommended that this proposal should be dropped. The UCSP provided similar
comments. The MESC also commented that it is contradictory to require States to establish a single maximum amount
and then indicate that States should take into consideration the type of occupational training, duration of training,
etc. The different types of training and varying durations render a single maximum cost meaningless. By applying
&sect;617.22(a)(6)(iv)(B), there will be sufficient cost control. Section 617.22(a)(6)(iv)(B) requires comparison
of training similar in quality, content and results at different training facilities, and approval of the lowest
cost training. Also, the ODHR recommended that more guidelines are needed in order to define the ``maximum amount
allowable for the total costs of training.'' Specifically, ODHR is concerned with overcoming inequities in setting
an amount both for individuals in a rural area without training facilities and for individuals in an urban area with
training facilities. The ODHR asked if it is the intent for the maximum amount allowable, because the cost of subsistence
or mileage is part of the cost of training, to limit the kinds or duration of training for individuals in rural areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department agrees with the comments and is amending this section by eliminating the requirement that States
establish, annually, a maximum amount allowable for the total cost of training for each worker. While the Congress
did not establish a national ceiling for the costs of training for individual workers, the Conferees did state in the
Conference Report that they expected the Secretary of Labor to set forth guidelines for State administering agencies
to provide approved training at the lowest reasonable cost for the particular type of training in that region consistent
with the objective of assisting import impacted workers to obtain suitable skills to return to work as quickly as possible.
The 1988 Amendments clearly provide that State administering agencies shall approve training for individual workers
at the lowest reasonable cost which will lead to employment and will result in training opportunities for the largest
number of adversely affected workers. This means that State administering agencies should avoid approving training
for occupations that require an extraordinarily high skill level relative to the worker's current skills level and
for which total costs of training, including transportation and subsistence, are excessively high. While the final
regulations eliminate the requirement for States to establish a maximum amount allowable for the total costs of training,
they continue to provide that States approve training at the lowest reasonable cost for the particular type of training
in that region that will lead to employment and will enable the worker to obtain employment within a reasonable period
of time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Child care
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The WESD, commenting on &sect;617.22, stated it believed that child care is equally important as transportation
and subsistence to include as a cost of training. The WESD recommended that child care be included under the definition
for supportive services, as is transportation and subsistence. The WESD states that the 1981 Amendments do not permit
self-financed training and require TAA or other Federal, State, or private sources to ``pay the full costs of the training.''
Washington contends that the lack of child care would, in fact, require self payment of training costs and it should
be included as part of the reasonable costs of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 236(b) authorizes transportation and subsistence expenses applicable to training. Child care is a supportive
service to be obtained for individuals under section 235 of the Act (and &sect;617.21(e)), and is not a training cost
in the TAA program. Funds for the administration of sections 225, 231 through 235, 243 and 244 of the Trade Act are appropriated
in the State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations (SUIESO) account. The SUIESO account includes
funds for the administration of section 235 activities but not for the direct payment of supportive services for certified
individuals. Since child care is a supportive service authorized by section 235 to be provided if available under
``any other Federal law'', no TAA funds are appropriated for such services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's position is that the State administering agency, in carrying out its responsibilities under section
235 and &sect;617.21(e), should make every reasonable effort to secure for adversely affected workers covered by
a certification any supportive services, including child care, which are obtainable under any other Federal law,
to help individuals in training and to obtain employment. No change is made in the regulations, but &sect;617.21 is
amended to make clear that supportive services are to be provided under other Federal law and may include child care.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MESC, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.24(e), stated that this rule allows approval of training for which all, or any portion, of the cost of training
is paid ``from any other source''. The MESC points out that the rule does not sufficiently define acceptable funding
sources. Some limits are necessary. Acceptable funding sources should be limited to recognized employment and training
programs, including employer training funds. Such funding sources as friends, relatives, and fraternal organizations
should not be acceptable, but &sect;617.24(e) does not preclude them.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department concurs in this comment and has modified &sect;&sect;617.24(e)(2) and 617.25(b)(1) to clarify that
other funding sources may not include sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends. This
is consistent with the Department's prior position on this matter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equal monthly installments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MESC questioned the application of the requirement in &sect;617.25(a) that employers be paid in equal monthly
installments for on-the-job training (OJT) programs. The MESC stated that problems are associated with trainees
entering OJT programs in the middle of the month, trainees receiving raises in wages during the month, and trainees
working different hours. The MESC explained that it has attempted to satisfy the intent of the equal monthly payment
requirement by having the employer bill for the trainee's hours in training during the month, which results in approximately
equal monthly payments. The Governor of Idaho and the WESD presented similar comments on &sect;617.25. The Governor
stated that the proposed rule will require Idaho and possibly many other States to incur additional administrative
costs to pay for tracking OJT reimbursements. The WESD suggested that reimbursement to employers for actual hours
worked by the trainee, on a monthly basis, would eliminate overpayments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that the statutory provision requiring payments for OJT to be made to employers in equal
monthly installments is presenting problems in negotiating and reimbursing employers for OJT contracts. In negotiating
OJT contracts with employers, reasonable costs should be based on the achievement of a prescribed level of job skills,
rather than being based solely on the hourly wages of the worker. The hourly wages should serve only as a guide for establishing
OJT contract costs. A raise in the worker's wages implies increased proficiency of the worker and higher productivity,
and may not form the basis for increasing training costs. Once the cost of OJT for a worker is established, payments
can be made in equal monthly installments, with any required adjustment made in the final payment to the employer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What appears to be troubling to States in administering this provision is thinking of equal monthly installments
in terms of equal ``dollar'' amounts. Instead, it appears most reasonable to base the ``equal monthly installments''
on the number of hours of paid work during the month, multiplied by the agreed upon rate of payment. Although this would
not assure the same dollar figure for each month, it is nonetheless ``equal'' in the sense that the payment for each
month is computed at the same rate. This method would appear to ad-dress the concerns expressed in the comments received,
and may be accomplished under the present reading of &sect;617.25(a). For these reasons, no change is made in the regulations.

Pell and similar grants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ODHR, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.25(b)(4)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), stated the rule is clear that when the direct payment of the costs of training has been made under any other Federal
law, or the costs are reimbursable under any other Federal law and a portion of the direct costs has already been paid
under such other Federal law, payment of such training costs may not be made from TAA funds. The ODHR points out, however,
that grants, such as Pell Grants, are often paid directly to the institution to be applied toward tuition. The ODHR
feels this contingency should be addressed here and that these funds should be allowed in these cases in determining
costs payable from TAA funds for training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that complications are presented in considering appropriate TAA funding in the case of Pell
Grants and similar Federal educational assistance. Section 617.25(b)(4)(ii)(C) provides, in implementing section
236(a)(4)(C), that such federal educational assistance paid to the individual may not be taken into account in determining
payment of the costs of training from TAA or other funds, but such payments to the individual shall be deducted from
TRA under &sect;617.13(c)(2). Conversely, when such Federal educational assistance is paid to the training institution,
to the extent it is used for training costs otherwise payable from TAA funds, it must be taken into account in determining
the training costs payable from TAA funds, either alone or in combination with other funds. To clarify this matter,
the regulations at &sect;617.25(b)(4)(ii)(C) are modified; combination funding is otherwise addressed in more
detail in the completely revised &sect;617.25.

OJT approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AFL&hyph;CIO recommended that additional standards be added in &sect;617.25(a) concerning the approval of
on-the-job training agreements. Further, the AFL&hyph;CIO recommended that since employers available to provide
OJT under TAA have offered such training under JTPA, those who failed to meet JTPA requirements should be barred from
receiving TAA funds for such training. Such a requirement is clearly in keeping with the emphasis on coordination
of TAA program activities with the JTPA Title III program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements in &sect;617.25(a) are based on existing statutory language, and provide adequate protection
to workers from adverse effects under OJT training contracts. The Department agrees that contracts under the TAA
program for OJT should not be entered into with employers who failed to meet JTPA requirements. While &sect;617.25
(a)(9) and (a)(10) are intended to avoid such situations, the final rule is clarified to help ensure that employers
who violated a JTPA training contract will be denied TAA training contracts. The words ``or under any other Federal
law'' is added after ``this Subpart C'' in paragraph (a)(9) of &sect;617.25, with another addition at the end of paragraph
(a)(9) to make this point clear.

and announced it will shortly lift the re-straints on homework in the women's and children's apparel industry. While
this matter is not finally resolved due to court challenges, the TAA regulations have to anticipate the situation
of potentially extensive homework in these industries.

for the worker (including whether there is a reasonable prospect which is reasonably foreseeable that the individual
will be reemployed by the firm from which separated), and compatibility of the training for the purposes of the TAA
Program. In these respects, suitability of training for the individual is encompassed within the several criteria
in &sect;617.22 (a), and compatibility with the program is covered by the various provisions of subpart C of this part
which describe the types of training approvable under &sect;617.22(a) and the limitations thereon.

Whether training is feasible or appropriate at any given time is determined by finding whether, at that time, training
suitable for the worker is available, the training is approvable under subpart C of this part including the criteria
in &sect;617.22(a), the worker is so situated as to be able to take full advantage of the training and satisfactorily
complete the training, full funding for the training is available from one or more sources in accordance with &sect;&sect;617.24
and 617.25, the worker has the financial resources to complete the training when the duration of the training program
exceeds the worker's eligibility for TRA, and the training will commence within 30 days of approval.

Planned recall. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of determining whether the recall or reemployment of an individual is reasonably foreseeable (for
the purposes of this section and &sect;617.22), either a specific or general type of recall (as set out) shall be deemed
to be sufficient.

Specific recall. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A specific recall is where an individual or group of individuals who was separated from employment is identified and
notified by the employer to return to work within a specified time period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General recall. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A general recall is where the employer announces an intention to recall an individual or group of individuals, or by
other action reasonably signals an intent to recall, without specifying any certain date or specific time period.

Reasonably foreseeable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of determining whether training should be denied and a training waiver granted, because of a planned
recall that is reasonably foreseeable, such a planned recall includes a specific recall and also includes a general
recall (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section) if the general recall in each individual's case is reasonably expected to occur before the individual
exhausts eligibility for any regular UI payments for which the individual is or may become entitled. A general recall,
in which the timing of the recall is reasonably expected to occur after the individual's exhaustion of any regular
UI to which the individual is or may become entitled, shall not be treated as precluding approval of training, but shall
be treated as any other worker separation for these purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The duration of training suitable for the individual exceeds the individual's maximum entitlement to basic and
additional TRA payments and the individual cannot assure financial responsibility for completing the training
program,

An individual who has been furnished a written notice of waiver under paragraph (a)(2) of this section (or denial of
waiver under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) shall be subject to all of the requirements of &sect;617.17(a), which
shall continue until the individual is enrolled in a training program as required by paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of &sect;617.11.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver review and revocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) State agencies must have a procedure for reviewing regularly (i.e., every 30 days or less) all waivers issued under
this section to individuals, to ascertain that the conditions upon which the waivers were granted continue to exist.
In any case in which the conditions have changed_i.e., training has become feasible and appropriate_then the waiver
must be revoked, and a written notice of revocation shall be furnished to the individual involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the periodic reviews required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, State agencies must have a procedure
for revoking waivers in individual cases promptly whenever a change in circumstances occurs. For example, a written
notice of revocation shall be issued to the individual concurrent with the approval of the training in which the individual
has enrolled (if such training is scheduled to commence within 30 days), and shall not be issued prior to such approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State agencies may incorporate a revocation section in the waiver form or on a separate revocation form. Any determination
under paragraph (c) of this section shall be a determination to which &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 apply. The information
included in a written notice of revocation issued under this paragraph (c) shall include all of the information required
for written notices issued under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) State agencies must develop procedures for compiling and reporting on the number of waivers issued and revoked,
by reason, as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and report such data to the Department of Labor as
requested by the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State agencies are not required to forward copies of individual waiver and revocation notices to the Department
of Labor, unless specifically requested by the Department. However, each State agency shall retain a copy of every
individual waiver and revocation notice issued by the State, for such period of time as the Department requires. (Approved
by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1205&hyph;0016).

 This training activity is any training of the type normally conducted in a classroom setting, including vocational
education, and may be provided to individuals when the conditions for approval of training are met, as provided in
&sect;617.22(a), to impart technical skills and information required to perform a specific job or group of jobs.
Training designed to enhance the employability of individuals by upgrading basic skills, through the provision
of courses such as remedial education or English-as-a-second-language, shall be considered as remedial education
approvable under &sect;617.22(a) if the criteria for approval of training under &sect;617.22(a) are met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions for approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Training shall be approved for an adversely affected worker if the State agency determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There is no suitable employment (which may include technical and professional employment) available for an adversely
affected worker.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) This means that for the worker for whom approval of training is being considered under this section, no suitable
employment is available at that time for that worker, either in the commuting area, as defined in &sect;617.3(k),
or outside the commuting area in an area in which the worker desires to relocate with the assistance of a relocation
allowance under subpart E of this part, and there is no reasonable prospect of such suitable employment becoming available
for the worker in the foreseeable future. For the purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section only, the term ``suitable
employment'' means, with respect to a worker, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker's
past adversely affected employment, and wages for such work at not less that 80 percent of the worker's average weekly
wage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The worker would benefit from appropriate training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This means that there is a direct relationship between the needs of the worker for skills training or remedial education
and what would be provided by the training program under consideration for the worker, and that the worker has the mental
and physical capabilities to undertake, make satisfactory progress in, and complete the training. This includes
the further criterion that the individual will be job ready on completion of the training program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There is a reasonable expectation of employment following completion of such training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This means that, for that worker, given the job market conditions expected to exist at the time of the completion
of the training program, there is, fairly and objectively considered, a reasonable expectation that the worker will
find a job, using the skills and education acquired while in training, after completion of the training. Any determination
under this criterion must take into account that ``a reasonable expectation of employment'' does not require that
employment opportunities for the worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of the approved
training. This emphasizes, rather than negates, the point that there must be a fair and objective projection of job
market conditions expected to exist at the time of completion of the training.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training approved by the Secretary is reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private
sources (which may include area vocational education schools, as defined in section 195(2) of the Vocational Education
Act of 1963, and employers).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This means that training is reasonably accessible to the worker within the worker's commuting area at any governmental
or private training (or education) provider, particularly including on-the-job training with an employer, and
it means training that is suitable for the worker and meets the other criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. It also
means that emphasis must be given to finding accessible training for the worker, although not precluding training
outside the commuting area if none is available at the time within the worker's commuting area. Whether the training
is within or outside the commuting area, the training must be available at a reasonable cost as prescribed in paragraph
(a)(6) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In determining whether or not training is reasonably available, first consideration shall be given to training
opportunities available within the worker's normal commuting area. Training at facilities outside the worker's
normal commuting area should be approved only if such training is not available in the area or the training to be provided
outside the normal commuting area will involve less charges to TAA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The worker is qualified to undertake and complete such training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This emphasizes the worker's personal qualifications to undertake and complete approved training. Evaluation
of the worker's personal qualifications must include the worker's physical and mental capabilities, educational
background, work experience and financial resources, as adequate to undertake and complete the specific training
program being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Evaluation of the worker's financial ability shall include an analysis of the worker's remaining weeks of UI
and TRA payments in relation to the duration of the training program. If the worker's UI and TRA payments will be exhausted
before the end of the training program, it shall be ascertained whether personal or family resources will be available
to the worker to complete the training. It must be noted on the worker's record that financial resources were discussed
with the worker before the training was approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When adequate financial resources will not be available to the worker to complete a training program which exceeds
the duration of UI and TRA payments, the training shall not be approved and consideration shall be given to other training
opportunities available to the worker.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Such training is suitable for the worker and available at a reasonable cost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Such training means the training being considered for the worker. Suitable for the worker means that paragraph
(a)(5) of this section is met and that the training is appropriate for the worker given the worker's capabilities,
background and experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Available at a reasonable cost means that training may not be approved at one provider when, all costs being considered,
training substantially similar in quality, content and results can be obtained from another provider at a lower total
cost within a similar time frame. It also means that training may not be approved when the costs of the training are unreasonably
high in comparison with the average costs of training other workers in similar occupations at other providers. This
criterion also requires taking into consideration the funding of training costs from sources other than TAA funds,
and the least cost to TAA funding of providing suitable training opportunities to the worker. Greater emphasis will
need to be given to these elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining the reasonable costs of training, particularly in view of the requirements in &sect;617.11(a) (2)
and (3) that TRA claimants be enrolled in and participate in training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For the purpose of determining reasonable costs of training, the following elements shall be considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) Costs of a training program shall include tuition and related expenses (books, tools, and academic fees), travel
or transportation expenses, and subsistence expenses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (B) In determining whether the costs of a particular training program are reasonable, first consideration must be
given to the lowest cost training which is available within the commuting area. When training, substantially similar
in quality, content and results, is offered at more than one training provider, the lowest cost training shall be approved;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (C) Training at facilities outside the worker's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal commuting area that involves transportation or subsistence costs which add substantially to the total costs
shall not be approved if other appropriate training is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allowable amounts for training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In approving a worker's application for training, the conditions for approval in paragraph (a) of this section must
be found to be satisfied, including assurance that the training is suitable for the worker, is at the lowest reasonable
cost, and will enable the worker to obtain employment within a reasonable period of time. An application for training
shall be denied if it is for training in an occupational area which requires an extraordinarily high skill level and
for which the total costs of the training are substantially higher than the costs of other training which is suitable
for the worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Previous approval of training under State law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Training previously approved for a worker under State law or other authority is not training approved under paragraph
(a) of this section. Any such training may be approved under paragraph (a) of this section, if all of the requirements
and limitations of paragraph (a) of this section and other provisions of Subpart C of this part are met, but such approval
shall not be retroactive for any of the purposes of this Part 617, including payment of the costs of the training and
payment of TRA to the worker participating in the training. However, in the case of a redetermination or decision reversing
a determination denying approval of training, for the purposes of this Part 617 such redetermination or decision
shall be given effect retroactive to the issuance of the determination that was reversed by such redetermination
or decision; but no costs of training may be paid unless such costs actually were incurred for training in which the
individual participated, and no additional TRA may be paid with respect to any week the individual was not actually
participating in the training.

to the ``14-day break in training'' provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.15(d), for purposes of receiving TRA payments. An individual's approved training program may be amended
by the State agency to add a course designed to satisfy unforeseen needs of the individual, such as remedial education
or specific occupational skills, as long as the length of the amended training program does not exceed the 104-week

Training programs that may be approved under &sect;617.22(a) include, but are not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) On-the-job training, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) Any training program provided by a State pursuant to Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) Any training program approved by a private industry council established under the Job Training Partnership Act,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) Any program of remedial education, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any training program (other than a training program described in paragraph (c) of &sect;617.25) for which all,
or any portion, of the costs of training the worker are paid_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Under any other Federal or State program other than this Subpart C, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From any other source other than this section, but not including sources personal to the individual, such as self,
relatives, or friends, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second sentence of amended section 236(a)(1) of the Act provides that an adversely affected worker shall be entitled
to have payment of the costs of training approved under the Act paid on the worker's behalf, subject, however, ``to
the limitations imposed by'' section 236. The limitations in section 236 which are implemented in this section concern
the restrictions on approval of training which are related directly or indirectly to the conditions on training which
are approvable or on the funding of training costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On-the-job training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The costs of on-the-job training approved Subpart C of this part for a worker, which are paid from TAA funds, shall be
paid in equal monthly installments. Such costs may be paid from TAA funds, and such training may be approved under subpart
C of this part, however, only if the State agency determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No currently employed individual is displaced by such eligible worker, including partial displacement such
as a reduction in the hours of non-overtime work, wages, or employment benefits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Such training does not impair existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) In the case of training which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, written
concurrence has been obtained from the concerned labor organization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) No other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job for which such eligible worker
is being trained; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The employer has not terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced the work force with
the intention of filling the vacancy so created by hiring the eligible worker; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The job for which the eligible worker is being trained is not being created in a promotional line that will infringe
in any way upon the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (7) Such training is not for the same occupation from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the worker was separated and with respect to which such worker's group was certified pursuant to section 222
of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(8) The employer certifies to the State agency that the employer will continue to employ the eligible worker for at
least 26 weeks after completing the training if the worker desires to continue such employment and the employer does
not have due cause to terminate such employment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The employer has not received payment under this Subpart C or under any other Federal law for any other on-the-job
training provided by such employer which failed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this
section or such other Federal law; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The employer has not taken, at any time, any action which violated the terms of any certification described in
paragraph (a)(8) of this section made by the employer with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by the
employer for which the employer has received a payment under Subpart C of this part (or the prior provisions of Subpart
C of this part).

Other authority and restrictions on funding_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 236(a) contains several provisions which allow the costs of a training program approved under the Act to be
paid_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Solely from TAA funds,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Solely from other public or private funds, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Partly from TAA funds and partly from other public or private funds,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
but also precludes the use of TAA funds or funds under another Federal law where such use of funds would result in duplication
of payment of training costs. Those authorities and restrictions are spelled out in paragraph (b) of this section:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 that, private funds may not include funds from sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 (i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (5)(E) of section 236(a) of the Act specifies one of the types of training programs approvable under the
Act, as including a program (other than a training program described in section 236(a)(7) (paragraph (b)(5) of this
section)) for which all, or any portion, of the costs of the training program are paid_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Under any Federal or State program other than the Act, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) From any source other than TAA funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (E) of section 236(a)(5) of the Act thus authorizes prearrangements between cooperating State agencies
administering the TAA program and the authorities administering any other Federal, State, or private funding source,
to agree upon any mix of TAA funds and other funds for paying the costs of a training program approved under Subpart C
of this part. Any such prearrangement must contain specific commitments from the other authorities to pay the costs
they agree to assume.

 (i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is related to section 236(a)(5)(E) in providing that the costs of a training
program approved under the Act are not required to be paid from TAA funds to the extent that such costs are paid under
any Federal or State program other than the Act or from any source other than the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Although paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is expressed in terms of the costs not being 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be paid from TAA funds, it authorizes the mixing of TAA funds and funds from any other Federal, State or private source.
Therefore, sharing the future costs of training is authorized where prior costs were paid from another Federal, State
or private source, but this does not authorize reimbursement from TAA funds of any training costs which were incurred
and for which payment became due prior to the approval of the training program under Subpart C of this part. In utilizing
the authority under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for sharing training costs, prearrangements shall be entered
into as required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section before any TAA funds are obligated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) contains a special restriction on the authority derived thereunder to use TAA
funds in sharing training costs. Therefore, before approving any training program under Subpart C of this part, which
may involve sharing of the training costs under the authority of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the cooperating
State agencies for the TAA program shall require the worker to enter into a written agreement with the State under which
TAA funds will not be applied for or used to pay any portion of the costs of the training the worker has reason to believe
will be paid by any other governmental or private source.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) of the Act (paragraph (3) of section 236(a) before August 23, 1988) continues to
provide, as it did before the addition of paragraphs (5)(E), (6), and (7) to section 236(a), that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) When the costs of training are paid from TAA funds under subpart C of this part, no other payment for such costs of training
may be made under any other Federal law; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) When the payment of the costs of training has already been made under any other Federal law, or the costs are reimbursable
under any other Federal law and a portion of the costs has already been paid under such other Federal law, payment of
such training costs may not be made from TAA funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) also requires that: The provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and (A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law
which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the identical costs incurred in training the adversely
affected worker under the TAA Program, even if such other use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion
of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Although the prohibition on duplicate payments in the first part of section 236(a)(4) remains fully implemented
in this section, the second part of section 236(a)(4) on the sharing of costs from TAA funds and other Federal fund sources
is modified by the explicit provisions of paragraphs (5)(E) and (6) of section 236(a), as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)
and (b)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When the direct costs of a training program approvable under subpart C of this part are payable from TAA funds and
are also wholly or partially payable under another Federal law, or under any State law or from private, nongovernmental
sources, the TAA Program agencies shall establish procedures which ensure that TAA funds shall not be utilized to
duplicate funds available from another source, but this preclusion of duplication does not prohibit and shall not
discourage sharing of costs under prearrangements authorized under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (4) of section 236(a), paragraph (b)(4) of this section continues to prohibit
duplicate payment of training costs, which is consistent with the general prohibition expressed in subpart C of this
part, against any use of TAA funds to duplicate payment of training costs in any circumstances. Paragraph (b)(4) of
this section also continues to prohibit taking into account, in determining whether training costs are payable from
TAA funds, any payments to the worker under any other Federal law which may have the effect of indirectly paying all

 Paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act provides that a training program shall not be approved under the Act if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under the Act, or from

 Paragraph (7) of section 236(a), which is implemented in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, reinforces the prohibition
in &sect;617.22(h) against approval of a training program under subpart C of this part if the worker is required to
pay a fee or tuition. The provisions of paragraph (b) and paragraph (h) of this section shall be given effect as prohibiting
the approval under subpart C of this part of any training program if the worker would be requested or required, at any
time or under any circumstances, to pay any of the costs of a training program, however small, from any TAA funds given
to the worker or from any other funds belonging to the worker from any source whatever. Aside from this stringent limitation,
however, paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act implicitly authorizes training approved under this subpart C
to be wholly or partly funded from nongovernmental (i.e., employer, union or other private) sources.

 Effective on November 21, 1988, in general, enrollment and participation in, or completion of, a training program
approved under subpart C is required as a condition of entitlement to basic TRA. Amendments to sections 231(a)(5),
231(b), and 231(c) of the Act incorporate this new requirement, replacing the job search program requirement which
remains in effect through November 20, 1988. Continuation of the job search program requirement through November
20, 1988, and installation of the training program requirement on and after November 21, 1988, is required of all applicants
for basic TRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility period for basic TRA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Effective on August 23, 1988, and with respect to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations,
and decisions on appeals) issued on or after that date, the eligibility period for basic TRA is changed from the prior
law. Prior to the OTCA amendments, section 233(a)(2) provided that the eligibility period for an individual was a
fixed 104-week period that immediately followed the week with respect to which the individual first exhausted all
rights to regular benefits after the individual's first qualifying separation. Under section 233(a)(2) the new
eligibility period is movable, and is the 104-week period that immediately follows the week in which the worker's
most recent total qualifying separation occurs under the same, single certification. Under the effective date provisions
of the OTCA, section 233(a)(2) applies to all decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions
on appeals) issued on and after August 23, 1988. Further, the law to be applied in making any such decision is the law
as in effect on the date such a decision is made. These interpretative rules apply in all cases, regardless of whether
the total qualifying separation occurred before, on, or after August 23, 1988, except as noted in paragraph (e)(3)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The major significance of the change in section 233(a)(2) is that, effective for all decisions (i.e., determinations,
redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) issued on or after August 23, 1988, it applies to the ``most recent''
total qualifying separation. This means that, after the first qualifying separation before August 23, 1988, or the
first total qualifying separation on and after August 23, 1988, with each subsequent total qualifying separation
of an individual under the same certification the individual's eligibility period must be redetermined as the 104-week
period that immediately follows the week in which such subsequent separation occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 1430(g) of the OTCA requires that the new eligibility period not be applied with respect to any total qualifying
separation occurring before August 23, 1988, if as a result of applying section 233(a)(2) the individual would have
an eligibility period with an earlier expiration date than the expiration date of the eligibility period established
under the prior law and based on a first qualifying separation which occurred under the same certification before
August 23, 1988. Therefore, for decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals)
issued on or after August 23, 1988, for a worker who had a first qualifying separation under the same certification
before August 23, 1988, it must be determined what the individual's eligibility period is based upon the prior law,
and, if the individual also had a subsequent total qualifying separation, what the individual's eligibility period
is based on the amended law. Only if the subsequent total qualifying separation occurred before August 23, 1988, and
the expiration date of the new eligibility period ends on the same date or a later date than the expiration date of the
old eligibility period may the new eligibility period be applied to the individual, and in that event it must be applied;
if the new eligibility period would end on a date earlier than the ending date of the eligibility period based on the
worker's first qualifying separation, section 1430(g) operates to preclude the application of amended section
233(a)(2).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Computation of the weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA do not change under the 1988 Amendments in the OTCA. They
must continue to be based upon the first benefit period which is related to the worker's first total or partial separation
under the same certification regardless of whether such first separation occurs before, on, or after August 23, 1988.
Upon the occurrence of a second or subsequent separation under the same certification which is a total qualifying
separation under this part 617, the individual's eligibility period will be 104 weeks after the week of such second
or subsequent (total qualifying) separation, but no change will be made in the weekly or maximum amounts of basic TRA
as computed in relation to the first separation. Therefore, for any decision (i.e., determination, redetermination,
or decision on appeal) issued on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after August 23, 1988, whenever an individual files a new TRA claim it will be necessary to determine whether the individual's
most recent separation was a total qualifying separation, and, if so, whether the individual had a prior partial or
total separation within the certification period of the same certification which was a first qualifying separation.
If such most recent (total qualifying) separation occurred before August 23, 1988, and was not the individual's first
qualifying separation, then:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The eligibility period will be the 104 weeks beginning with the week following the week in which the most recent
total qualifying separation occurred 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 104 weeks after the first exhaustion of regular UI following the first qualifying separation, whichever is longer,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The individual's weekly amount of basic TRA, as computed under &sect;617.13, and the individual's maximum amount
of basic TRA, as computed under &sect;617.14, are established or remain fixed as determined with respect to the individual's
first benefit period following the first separation which is within the certification period of the certification
covering the individual.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility period for additional TRA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One technical and one conforming change are made by the OTCA in section 233(a)(3) of the Act, but have no effect on the
26-week eligibility period for additional TRA as the statute has been interpreted and applied in the past. Therefore,
the 26-week eligibility period begins with the first week of training if the training begins after exhaustion of basic
TRA. Further, if the training begins before approval is obtained under this part 617, the 26-week eligibility period
begins with the week in which the determination of approval is issued, if there is any scheduled training session in
that week after the date of the determination.

Eligibility for TRA during breaks in training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act, added by the OTCA, provides for the payment, under specified conditions,
of both basic and additional TRA during scheduled breaks in a training program, provided the conditions for such payments
are met as expressed in this part 617. By making this provision applicable to basic TRA as well as additional TRA, paragraph
(f) of section 233 of the Act changes the prior law for both. Previously, basic TRA was payable during training breaks,
but additional TRA was payable solely with respect to weeks of training. Under new section 233(f), both basic and additional
TRA are payable during training breaks, but only if the break does not exceed 14 days. Now, as under the prior law, weeks
when TRA is not payable will still count against the eligibility periods for both basic and additional TRA, and in the
case of additional TRA it will also count against the number of weeks payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act is effective with regard to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations,
and decisions on appeals) made on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of when the training was approved under section
236 of the Trade Act, or whether the training was approved or is approvable under section 236 as amended by the 1988 Amendments,
or when the break in training began or ended. In making any decision involving paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act,
the law to be applied is the law as in effect on the date the decision is made.

Retroactive eligibility for TRA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Effective on August 23, 1988, section 1425(b) of the OTCA provides for an open-ended waiver of the time limit in
section 233(a)(2) on the eligibility period for basic TRA, and the 210-day time limit in section 233(b) on filing a
bona fide application for training in order to qualify for additional TRA. This waiver provision applies solely to
workers who experienced a total qualifying separation in the period which began on August 13, 1981 and ended on April
7, 1986. Other conditions must be met that are specified in section 1425(b) and in this part 617. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Altogether, nine conditions must be met for workers to obtain TRA payments under this special provision. (See
&sect;617.11(a)(3).) Further, this special provision applies solely to weeks which begin after August 23, 1988;
no retroactive payments may be made under this special provision. Finally, only the two specific time limitations
are waived, and all other requirements of the prior and amended law apply, including the first separation rule (relating
to computation of the weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA payable), the 26-week eligibility period for additional

Section 239 also was amended by the OTCA, to require new terms and conditions in the section 239 agreements. This requires
new agreements to be executed between the States and the Secretary of Labor, and gives new emphasis to the contractual
nature of the obligations entered into by the States to administer the TAA Program in strict accordance with the Act
and the regulations and operating instructions issued by the Department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3304(a)(1) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and section 303(a)(2) of the Social Security Act require that
a State law provide for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Payment of unemployment compensation solely through public employment offices or such other agencies as the Secretary
may approve.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3304(a)(4) of the Federal Unemployment Tax and section 303(a)(5) of the Social Security Act require that

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Expenditure of all money withdrawn from an unemployment fund of such State, in the payment of unemployment compensation
*&blank;*&blank;*'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Secretary's interpretation of federal law requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Secretary interprets section 3304(a)(1) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and section 303(a)(2) of the Social
Security Act to require that a State law provide for payment of unemployment compensation solely through public employment
offices or claims offices administered by the State employment security agency if such agency provides for such coordination
in the operations of its public employment offices and claims offices as will insure (a) the payment of benefits only
to individuals who are unemployed and who are able to work and available for work, and (b) that individuals claiming
unemployment compensation (claimants) are afforded such placement and other employment services as are necessary
and appropriate to return them to suitable work as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Such contact by claimants with public employment offices or claims offices or both, (1) as will reasonably insure
the payment of unemployment compensation only to individuals who are unemployed and who are able to work and available

to facilitate their return to suitable work as soon as possible; and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 A. Claim filing_total or part-total unemployment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Individuals claiming unemployment compensation for total or part-total unemployment are required to file a claim
weekly or biweekly, in person or by mail, at a public employment office or a claims office (these terms include offices
at itinerant points) as set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Except as provided in paragraph 3, a claimant is required to file in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. His new claim with respect to a benefit year, or his continued claim for a waiting week or for his first compensable
week of unemployment in such year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Any other claim, when requested to do so by the claims personnel at the office at which he files his claim(s) because
questions about his right to benefits are raised by circumstances such as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The conditions or circumstances of his separation from employment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claim(s) indicate that he may be unable to work or that there may be undue
restrictions on his availability for work or that his search for work may be inadequate or that he may be disqualified;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claims create uncertainty about his credibility or indicate a lack
of understanding of the applicable requirements; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The claimant's record shows that he has previously filed a fraudulent claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such circumstances, the claimant is required to continue to file claims in person each week (or biweekly) until
the State agency determines that filing claims in person is no longer required for the resolution of such questions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A claimant must be permitted to file a claim by mail in any of the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. He is located in an area requiring the expenditure of an unreasonable amount of time or money in traveling to the nearest
facility established by the State agency for filing claims in person; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Conditions make it impracticable for the agency to take claims in person; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. He has returned to full-time work on or before the scheduled date for his filing a claim, unless the agency makes provision
for in-person filing at a time and place that does not interfere with his employment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The agency finds that he has good cause for failing to file a claim in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A claimant who has been receiving benefits for partial unemployment may continue to file claims as if he were a partially
unemployed worker for the first four consecutive weeks of total or part-total unemployment immediately following
his period of partial unemployment so long as he remains attached to his regular employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Claim filing_partial unemployment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each individual claiming unemployment compensation for a week (or other claim period) during which, because of lack
of work, he is working less than his normal customary full-time hours for his regular employer and is earning less than
the earnings limit provided in the State law, shall not be required to file a claim for such week or other claim period
earlier than 2 weeks from the date that wages are paid for such claim period or, if a low earnings report is required by
the State law, from the date the employer furnished such report to the individual. State agencies may permit claims
for partial unemployment to be filed either in person or by mail, except that in the circumstances set forth in section
A 3, filing by mail must be permitted, and in the circumstances set forth in section A 2 b, filing in person may be required.

Requirement for Job Finding, Placement, and Other Employment Services Designed to Satisfy Secretary's Interpretation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Claims personnel are required to assure that each claimant is doing what a reasonable individual in his circumstances
would do to obtain suitable work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. In the discretion of the State agency: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The claims personnel are required to give each claimant such necessary and appropriate assistance as they reasonably
can in finding suitable work and at their discretion determine when more complete placement and employment services
are necessary and appropriate for a claimant; and if they determine more complete services are necessary and appropriate,
the claims personnel are to refer him to employment service personnel in the public employment office in which he has
been filing claim(s), or, if he has been filing in a claims office, in the public employment office most accessible
to him; or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All placement and employment services are required to be afforded to each claimant by employment service personnel
in the public employment office most accessible to him in which case the claims personnel in the office in which the
claimant files his claim are to refer him to the employment service personnel when placement or other employment services
are necessary and appropriate for him. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The personnel to whom the State agency assigns the responsibilities outlined in paragraph B above are required
to give claimants such job-finding assistance, placement, and other employment services as are necessary and appropriate
to facilitate their return to suitable work as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some circumstances, no such services or only limited services may be required. For example, if a claimant is on a
short-term temporary layoff with a fixed return date, the only service necessary and appropriate to be given to him
during the period of the layoff is a referral to suitable temporary work if such work is being performed in the labor
market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, claimants whose unemployment is caused by a labor dispute presumably will return to work with their employer
as soon as the labor dispute is settled. They generally do not need services, nor do individuals in occupations where
placement customarily is made by other nonfee charging placement facilities such as unions and professional associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants who fall within the classes which ordinarily would require limited services or no services shall, if they
request placement and employment services, be afforded such services as are necessary and appropriate for them to
obtain suitable work or to achieve their reasonable employment goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, a claimant who is permanently separated from his job is likely to require some services. He may need
only some direction in how to get a job; he may need placement services if he is in an occupation for which there is some
demand in the labor market area; if his occupation is outdated, he may require counseling and referral to a suitable
training course. The extent and character of the services to be given any particular claimant may change with the length
of his unemployment and depend not only on his own circumstances and conditions, but also on the condition of the labor
market in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Claimants are required to report to employment service personnel, as directed, but such personnel and the claims
personnel required to so arrange and coordinate the contacts required of a claimant as not to place an unreasonable
burden on him or unreasonably limit his opportunity to establish his rights to compensation. As a general rule, a claimant
is not required to contact in person claims personnel or employment service personnel more frequently than once a
week, unless he is directed to report more frequently for a specific service such as referral to a job or a training course
or counseling which cannot be completed in one visit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Employment service personnel are required to report promptly to claims personnel in the office in which the claimant
files his claim(s): (1) his failure to apply for or accept work to which he was referred by such personnel or when known,
by any other nonfee-charging placement facility such as a union or a professional association; and (2) any information
which becomes available to it that may have a bearing on the claimant's ability to work or availability for work, or
on the suitability of work to which he was referred or which was offered to him.

Evaluation of Alternative State Provisions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
If the State law provisions do not conform to the ``suggested State law requirements'' set forth in sections 5001 and
5002, but the State law contains alternative provisions, the Manpower Administrator, in collaboration with the
State agency, will study the actual or anticipated affect of the alternative provisions. If the Manpower Administrator
concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy the requirements of the Federal law as construed by the Secretary
(see section 5000 B) he will so notify the State agency. If he does not so conclude, he will submit the matter to the Secretary.
If the Secretary concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy such requirements, the State agency will be so
notified. If the Secretary concludes that there is a question as to whether the alternative provisions satisfy such
requirements, the State agency will be advised that unless the State law provisions are appropriately revised, a
notice of hearing will be issued as required by the Code of Federal Regulations, title 20, section 601.3.

This notice proposes special conditions for the Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) Model(s) PW4073 and PW4048 turbofan engines.
The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems
from medium and large bird ingestion. This notice proposes the additional safety standards which the Administrator
considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards
for aircraft engines of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 10, 1990, Pratt &amp; Whitney applied for type certification of PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan
engines. The FAA has determined that the current foreign object ingestion requirements of &sect;33.77(a) for four
pound birds; and &sect;33.77(b) for one and one-half pound flocking birds, do not adequately represent the bird threat
encountered in service. A study of in-service bird ingestion events has indicated a need to modify the bird ingestion
requirements of this section to ensure design integrity and demonstrate an adequate level of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concluded that additional safety standards must be applied to Pratt &amp; Whitney Model(s) PW4073 and
PW4048 turbofan engines to demonstrate that they are capable of acceptable operation after medium and large bird
ingestion. The applicable airworthiness requirements do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards
for type certification with respect to the new design criteria. This new design criteria assumes the actual bird threat
encountered in service.

Type of Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the FAR, Pratt &amp; Whitney must show that the PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084
turbofan engines meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those
Federal Aviation Regulations are &sect;21.21 and part 33, effective February 1, 1965, as amended through August
10, 1990, Amendment 33&hyph;14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for the PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan engines because of its unique design
criteria. Therefore, the Administrator proposes these special conditions under the provisions of &sect;21.16
to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice and
opportunity for comment, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification
basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).

The Proposed Special Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the
type certification basis for the Pratt &amp; Whitney Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan engines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In lieu of the requirements of FAR &sect;33.77(a) and (b), the following tests and analyses must be conducted, unless
compliance can be shown by alternate methods acceptable to the Administrator:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) It must be shown that the ingestion of a single large bird, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix A, will not
cause the engine to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) catch fire;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) release hazardous fragments through the engine casing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) generate loads greater than those ultimate loads specified under &sect;33.23(a);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) lose the ability to be shut down; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Alternatively, if compliance with the bird ingestion requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition
is not established, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with the containment requirements of &sect;33.94(a)
constitutes a more severe demonstration than the requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition. The engine
type certification documentation will then be endorsed to reflect this alternative compliance method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) It must be shown that the ingestion of medium birds, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix B, will not cause
the engine to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sustain more than a 25 percent thrust loss;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be shut down during the required run-on demonstration prescribed in Appendix B;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Exceed any engine operating limitations to the extent that the engine cannot comply with this section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) It must be shown that engine spinner impact by one large bird and by the single largest medium bird, under the respective
conditions prescribed in Appendices A and B, will not affect the engine to the extent that it cannot comply with the
requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b of this special condition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 4, 1992, Rolls-Royce applied for type certification of Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;870&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines. The application for type certification of the Model RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;870&hyph;17 turbofan
engine was withdrawn and a new application for type certification of the Model RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17
was made on April 6, 1993. The FAA has determined that the current water and hail ingestion requirements of &sect;33.77(c)
of the FAR do not represent the inclement weather threat encountered in service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study of in-service inclement weather events has indicated a need to modify the water and hail ingestion requirements
of this section to ensure design integrity and demonstrate an adequate level of safety. This study indicated that
a potential flight safety threat existed for engines when operating in severe weather environments. Although current
requirements provide adequate validation of the engine's resistance to mechanical damage due to hail impact and
case contractions from water ingestion, the study showed that the current standards did not adequately address engine
power loss anomalies, such as rollback and flameout at lower than take off rated power settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concluded that additional safety standards must be applied to Rolls-Royce Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines to demonstrate that they are capable of acceptable operation in severe weather environments.

Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the FAR, Rolls-Royce must show that Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those
Federal Aviation Regulations are &sect;21.21 and Part 33, effective February 1, 1965, as amended through August
10, 1990, Amendment 33&hyph;14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for Rolls-Royce Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines because of unique design criteria. Therefore, the Administrator proposes these special conditions
under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.

In addition to the requirements of FAR &sect;33.77, the following tests and analyses must be conducted, unless compliance
can be shown by alternate methods acceptable to the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The most critical operating point(s) for water and hail ingestion must be determined by test, analysis, or other
acceptable methods, and must be based on the threat levels defined in Table 1 and Table 2 of this proposal. The critical
point(s) determination must address the entire operating envelope of the engine. The critical operating point(s)
is defined as those operating conditions within the engine flight envelope at which an engine operability margin
is reduced to a minimum level.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace (Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above
the surface of the earth) at Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accommodate Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Runway
29 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP). Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above
ground level (AGL) is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this proposal is to
provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft
operating in visual weather conditions.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace to Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accommodate NDB Runway 29 SIAP. Controlled airspace extending
from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this action is
to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft
operating in visual weather conditions. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined area which would
enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The EPA is taking action to approve the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission State II State Implementation
Plan (SIP), which includes a SIP Supplement dated September 30, 1992, and Regulation V (31 TAC Section 115 Subchapter
C: Volatile Organic Compound Marketing Operations), as a revision to the Texas SIP for ozone. On November 13, 1992,
Texas submitted a SIP revision request to the EPA to satisfy the Clean Air Act, as amended (1990). This SIP revision
requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment
in the four Texas ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse. This revision applies to the Texas counties
of Brazoria, Chambers, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Fort Bend, Galveston, Hardin, Harris, Jefferson, Liberty,
Montgomery, Orange, Tarrant, and Waller.

Under section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of
Stage II systems. The EPA issued technical guidance in November 1991, and enforcement guidance in December 1991,
to meet this requirement.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, on April 16, 1992, the EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret
the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate what the EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that
requirement.

The EPA has designated four areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Texas. The Houston/Galveston/Brazoria ozone
nonattainment area is classified as severe and contains the following eight counties: Brazoria, Chambers, Fort
Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area is
classified as serious and contains the following three counties: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The El Paso ozone
nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the county of El Paso. The Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment
area is classified as moderate and contains the following four counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant. The
designations for ozone were published in the

 (FR) on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See
56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR sections 81.300&hyph;81.437.
Under section 182(b)(3) of the amended CAA, Texas was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for these areas
by November 15, 1992. On November 13, 1992, Governor Ann W. Richards submitted to the EPA Stage II vapor recovery rules
and a SIP Supplement dated September 30, 1992, which were adopted by the State on October 16, 1992. By today's action,
the EPA is proposing to approve this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements
and for consistency with the EPA guidance. A summary of the EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, a more detailed
analysis of the State submittal is contained in a TSD, dated June 25, 1993, which is available from the Region 6 Office,
listed above.

I. Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, States were required by November 15, 1992, to adopt regulations requiring owners
or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate vapor recovery equipment at their facilities.
The amended CAA specifies that these State rules must apply to any facility that dispenses more than 10,000 gallons
of gasoline per month or, in the case of an independent small business marketer, any facility that dispenses more than
50,000 gallons of gasoline per month. Section 324 of the CAA defines an independent small business marketer. The State
has adopted a general applicability requirement of 10,000 gallons per month and has not included a lower applicability
for independent small business marketers. However, independent small business marketer which dispense less than
50,000 gallons have a provision for an extended compliance deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As more fully discussed in the EPA's Enforcement Guidance and the General Preamble (57 FR at 13514), the State has provided
that the gallons of gasoline dispensed per month will be based on the gasoline throughput for each calendar month beginning
January 1, 1991. The State is interpreting this requirement to mean that if a facility exceeds the throughput limits
for any one month, the facility will be required to install Stage II. While the State is not calculating the average
volume of gasoline dispensed per month for the two year period preceding the adoption date, the EPA believes that the
State's method will require more gasoline dispensing facilities to comply with Stage II requirements. In addition,
the State has specified that the State II requirements apply to all gasoline dispensing facilities, including retail
outlets and fleet fueling facilities, with throughput rates as defined above. However, the State has exempted gasoline
dispensing equipment used exclusively for the fueling of aircraft, marine vessels, or implements of agriculture.
The EPA has determined that these limited exemptions are acceptable in the Texas Stage II program for the following
reasons. Historically, the Stage II program was intended to reduce refueling emissions for ``on-road'' motor vehicles.
These limited exemptions would not be considered to be on-road motor vehicles. Also, refueling systems of gasoline
powered vehicles such as aircraft, marine vessels, and implements of agriculture are normally designed with nonstandardized
equipment for which Stage II systems designed for on-road vehicle refueling facilities may not be compatible. The
acceptability of these limited exemptions does not preclude the State from requiring refueling vapor recovery systems
at such facilities at a later date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 324 establishes a statutory definition of an independent small business marketer, which is fully set forth
in the TSD. The State has adopted the statutory definition of independent small business marketer in its regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA finds the applicability requirements in the Texas Stage II rule to be acceptable.

II. Implementation of Stage II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CAA specifies the time by which certain facilities must comply with the State regulation. For facilities that
are not owned or operated by an independent small business marketer, these times, calculated from the time of State
adoption of the regulation, are: (1) Six months for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990,
(2) one year for facilities that dispense greater than 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month, and (3) two years for
all other facilities. The Texas Stage II rule time schedule sets compliance dates of May 15, 1993, November 15, 1993,
and November 15, 1994, respectively for the above three deadlines. Although Texas adopted its Stage II regulations
on October 16, 1992, the EPA believes it is appropriate to accept the adoption date to be November 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to approve the submitted time table for the following reasons. First, the CAA states that the adoption
date must be used to calculate the compliance schedule for Stage II implementation at facilities. In this case, the
EPA defines the adoption date to be the date when the regulation and the rest of the SIP was required to be submitted to
the EPA on November 15, 1992. The compliance deadlines triggered by this date begin within the time schedule specified
by the CAA. Secondly, remedying this deficiency by amending the compliance schedule would cause further delay in
the implementation of Stage II in Texas. Lastly, the Texas rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements and the
EPA believes it will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated areas. Therefore, the EPA believes
it is in the public interest to approve and make enforceable this requirement at the earliest time feasible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Texas program, independent small business marketers of gasoline, for which the monthly gasoline throughput
is less than 50,000 gallons per month, may petition, no later than November 15, 1993, the State's Executive Director
for an extension of the compliance deadline to December 22, 1998, or until on or more of the facility's gasoline storage
tanks are replaced and/or equipped with corrosive protection, which is required by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission. This extension provision for independent small business marketers of gasoline, for which the monthly
gasoline throughput is less than 50,000 gallons per month, is acceptable because the CAA does not require Stage II
systems to be installed on such facilities.

III. Additional Program Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the EPA's guidance, the State requires that Stage II systems be tested and certified to meet a 95 percent
emission reduction efficiency. The EPA has indicated three acceptable methods of demonstrating a 95 percent emission
reduction efficiency: (1) A method tested and approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB); (2) a testing
program that is equivalent to the CARB program, that will be conducted by the Program Oversight Agency or by a third
party recognized by the Program Oversight Agency, and submitted and approved by the EPA for incorporation into the
SIP; or (3) a system approved by CARB. The State has chosen to use option three, a system approved by CARB. The State requires
sources to verify proper installation and function of Stage II equipment through use of a liquid blockage test and
a leak test prior to system operation and at least every five years or upon major modification of a facility (i.e., 75
percent or more equipment change).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to recordkeeping, the State has adopted those items recommended in the EPA's guidance and specifies
that sources subject to Stage II must make these documents available upon request: (1) A copy of the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order for the specific Stage II vapor recovery system installed at the facility,
(2) results of verification tests, (3) equipment maintenance and compliance file logs indicating compliance with
manufacturer's specifications and requirements, (4) training certification files, and (5) inspection and compliance
records. In addition, the State has committed in their SIP supplement to maintain a general compliance file, including
information such as facility name, address, phone number, owner/operator names, a State assigned reference number,
date of initial compliance with the regulations, number of pumps and monthly gasoline throughput. The State has also
established an inspection function consistent with that described in the EPA's guidance. The State commits to conducting
inspections of facilities including a visual inspection of the Stage II equipment and of the required records and
a functional test of the Stage II equipment. According to the Supplement, the State shall inspect each facility at
least one time per year with follow-up inspections at noncomplying facilities. Finally, the State has established
procedures for enforcing violations of the Stage II requirements, and has committed to establish a penalty schedule
in the SIP. A detailed draft penalty schedule has already been developed by the State. Administrative penalties may
be assessed of up to $10,000 per day per violation and civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day per violation. The EPA
finds the State's program for implementation and enforcement of the Stage II program to be consistent with the EPA
guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Rulemaking Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the EPA finds that the State has adopted a Stage II SIP in accordance with section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, as interpreted
in EPA's guidance, the EPA is proposing to approve the submittal as meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Regulatory Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. section 600 et. seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility
analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604). Alternatively,
the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small
entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published

Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions from the requirements of section three of Executive Order 12291 for a period
of two years (54 FR 2222). The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions.
The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request is
still applicable under Executive Order 12866.

, that is required by section 8002(o) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6982(o). The
Report to Congress contains a detailed study of cement kiln dust (CKD), which is within the scope of the exemption from
hazardous waste regulations provided by section 3001(b)(3)(A)(iii) of RCRA as codified at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(8); this
exemption is often referred to as the Bevill Exemption. The report also presents the Agency's decision making rationale
and a series of options being considered regarding regulatory options for cement kiln dust waste. Information submitted
in public comments and at a public hearing will be used in conjunction with the Report to Congress to make a final determination
on the regulatory status of these wastes.

RCRA section 3001(b)(3) (hereafter referred to as the Bevill Exemption) exempts, among other things, cement kiln
dust waste from regulation under RCRA subtitle C, pending completion of a Report to Congress and a subsequent determination
of whether such regulation is warranted. In RCRA section 8002(o), Congress directed EPA to conduct a detailed and
comprehensive study based on eight study factors (discussed below) and submit a Report to Congress on ``the adverse
effects on human health and the environment, if any, of the disposal and utilization of cement kiln dust waste''. RCRA
section 3001(b)(3)(C) then requires that EPA determine, within six months of the date of submission of the Report
to Congress, either to promulgate regulations for CKD under subtitle C or determine that subtitle C regulation is
unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bevill Exemption was added to RCRA on October 12, 1980, as part of the 1980 Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendment. In
response to the 1980 RCRA amendments, EPA published an interim final amendment to its hazardous waste regulations
to reflect the provisions of the Bevill Exemption (40 CFR 261.4(b)(8)). Since that time, cement kiln dust has remained
exempt from subtitle C of RCRA, meaning that this material has never been subject to hazardous waste regulations under
Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1989, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed suit against EPA for failing to complete the RTC as required
by RCRA. On June 19, 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree with EDF. In the proposed consent decree, EPA agreed
to complete the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust by April 30, 1993. The proposed consent decree was later modified
to extend the deadline for issuance of the Report to Congress to December 31, 1993.

B. Report to Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA has completed its study of CKD waste and prepared the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust. In keeping with the
statutory requirements, the report addresses the following factors (hereafter ``study factors'') required under
section 8002(o) of RCRA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The source and volumes of such materials generated per year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Present disposal practices; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Potential danger, if any, to human health and the environment from the disposal of such materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Documented cases in which danger to human health or the environment has been proved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Alternatives to current disposal methods; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The costs of such alternatives; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The impact of those alternatives on the use of natural resources; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The current and potential utilization of such materials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition, section 8002(o) directs the Agency review other Federal and state studies and actions (e.g., regulations)
to avoid duplication of effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency's approach in preparing the Report to Congress was to combine certain study factors for purposes of analysis
and to evaluate these study factors in a step-wise fashion. This evaluation process, hereafter referred to as EPA's
decision rationale, is a three-step methodology that was used in making the regulatory determinations for Mineral
Processing Special Wastes (56 FR 27305, June 13, 1991) and the four large-volume Wastes from the Combustion of Coal
by Electric Utilities (58 FR 42466, August 9, 1993). The decision rationale contributed to the development of the
proposed options for managing CKD waste. EPA is soliciting comment on how the decision rationale can be used in the
Agency's decision-making process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The resulting review and discussion of EPA's analysis is organized into ten chapters in Volume II of the Report to Congress:
Methods and Findings. (Volume I is an Executive Summary.) The first chapter of Volume II briefly summarizes the purpose
and scope of the report, general methods and information sources used, and EPA's decision making methodology. The
second chapter provides a brief overview of the cement industry, including a description of CKD waste, the industry
structure and characteristics, the cement manufacturing process, the types of production processes used, and significant
process inputs (RCRA Study Factor 1). The third chapter discusses the generation and chemical and physical characteristics
of CKD (Study Factors 1 and 3). The fourth chapter outlines the range of CKD management methods employed at domestic
cement plants (Study Factor 2). The fifth chapter identifies and summarizes cases of potential and documented damages
to human health and the environment (Study Factor 4). The sixth chapter includes a discussion of EPA's risk assessment
in which the Agency examined inherent hazards posed by CKD, evaluated site-specific risk factors, and performed
quantitative transport, fate and exposure modeling (Study Factor 3). The seventh chapter summarizes applicable
federal and state regulatory controls. The eighth chapter investigates alternative waste management practices
and potential utilization of the wastes (Study Factors 5, 6, and 7). The ninth chapter discusses costs and impacts
under each of several regulatory and operational scenarios (Study Factor 8). The tenth and final chapter of Volume
II of the Report to Congress summarizes and analyzes the findings of EPA's evaluation of the above study factors and
presents a series of options the Agency is considering, based on these findings, concerning the management of cement
kiln dust.

C. Decision Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
After studying cement kiln dust, the Agency used the decision rationale to evaluate the findings of the study factors,
and to formulate a series of options being considered regarding the level of control needed for CKD. In Step 1 of the
decision rationale, the Agency first determined whether the management of CKD poses human health/environmental
problems and the potential for current practices to cause problems in the future. In Step 2, the Agency looked at waste
management practices and existing regulations to examine the potential for releases and exposure under current
practices. In Step 3, the Agency evaluated the costs and impacts associated with regulating this waste under Subtitle
C and, possibly, other regulatory scenarios.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The rationale for the order of questions is that cement kiln dust should first be considered to present risk to human
health or the environment or a potential risk under plausible mismanagement scenarios before the Agency considers
it for regulation under RCRA subtitle C. Second, before it considers regulating the waste under subtitle C, the Agency
should determine that current management practices and existing state and Federal regulatory controls are inadequate
to limit the risks posed by a waste. Then it should consider whether subtitle C regulation would be effective and appropriate.
Finally, the special statutory status of the waste requires that the Agency consider the impacts to the industry that
regulation under subtitle C would create in making a decision to regulate the waste as hazardous. Therefore, the decision
rationale allows EPA to systematically narrow its focus as to whether the waste may present significant risk of harm
and whether additional regulatory controls are necessary and desirable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tentative answers to the questions posed in its three-step decision rationale are discussed below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 1: Does management of CKD pose human health and environmental problems? Might current practices cause problems
in the future? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing evidence of damage to human health and the environment, performing a risk assessment, and reviewing
the results of laboratory analyses of waste samples, EPA has concluded that risks associated with CKD management
are generally low, however, there is a potential under certain circumstances for CKD to pose a danger to human health
and environment, and may do so in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data collected from state files and EPA site visits identify common CKD waste management practices, including management
in exposed, unlined piles, abandoned quarries, and landfills, that have caused, and may continue to cause, contamination
of air and nearby surface water and ground water. Management practices such as disposal in a water-filled quarry and
management in piles adjacent to grazing and agricultural fields or surface water bodies also pose a potential danger
to human health and the environment. In addition, risk modeling results supports the conclusion that CKD can potentially
pose risks to human health and the environment under certain hypothetical, yet plausible scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 2: Is more stringent regulation necessary or desirable? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reached no conclusions with respect to the need for more stringent regulation. EPA's preliminary analysis
of the effectiveness of State and Federal regulations and controls suggests that additional controls should be evaluated;
for example, controls for CKD management scenarios which potentially present high risks, if those scenarios exist.
While CKD is regulated under State and local laws, the specific requirements for CKD vary from state to state. In many
instances, minimal controls are applied to these wastes. Also, recycling technologies could be used as a means to
improve waste management practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 3: What would be the operational and economic consequences of a decision to regulate CKD under subtitle C? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operational costs of CKD regulation are largely dependent on the management alternative selected. If CKD is managed
as a hazardous waste under RCRA subtitle C, facilities that manage their CKD through on-site land disposal are estimated
to incur significant compliance costs. However, the financial burden of compliance, even for waste dust generated
in kilns that burn RCRA hazardous waste, may be reduced, if facilities are able to adopt pollution prevention technologies
which recycle CKD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possible economic outcomes of a decision to regulate CKD under RCRA subtitle C cover a broad spectrum. An economic
analysis of innovative pollution prevention technologies (including alkali leaching, flue gas desulfurization,
and fluid-bed dust recovery), suggests that the potentially high compliance costs of CKD land disposal may drive
the industry toward more recycling of their CKD. However, at this early stage of their development, it is uncertain
that these recycling technologies can be widely adopted by the industry. Moreover, even if CKD is recycled, some facilities
may incur substantial disposal costs.

D. Regulatory Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This section presents a series of options the Agency is considering concerning the management of cement kiln dust
waste based on the findings of this Report. In accordance with RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C), EPA will make a regulatory
determination for cement kiln dust waste after submitting this Report to Congress, and after holding a public hearing,
and accepting and reviewing public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, cement kiln dust waste generally presents a low inherent toxicity, is only rarely characteristically
hazardous, and, in most cases based on risk modeling, does not present a risk to human health and the environment. However,
cement kiln dust waste may pose a potential threat to human health and the environment considering plausible worst
case conditions under certain hypothetical management scenarios (see Chapters 5 and 6). Major factors increasing
the potential for human health and environmental damages include proximity to potential exposure points such as
agricultural fields and surface water bodies, as well as the concentrations of key constituents of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the findings, and an initial evaluation of regulatory options, the Agency has not decided whether to retain
or remove the CKD exemption. The Agency considered a number of options which represent a wide range of scenarios that
would subject CKD to different management requirements and enforcement oversight. From these, the Agency has chosen
to highlight five, including three in which CKD would be managed under subtitle C, with the intent to focus public comment
from environmental groups, industry, and other interested parties regarding the most appropriate approach to manage
CKD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA notes that regulations for the management of CKD waste under subtitle C may not be warranted or appropriate if other
Agency-administered programs are better suited to address the concerns identified in this Report. Among the statutes
that may have authority to address the indirect foodchain risks associated with CKD are the Clean Water Act (stormwater
management regulations), the Clean Air Act (the program defining the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (which gives the Agency authority to issue appropriate regulations
to address the risks from hazardous chemical substances or mixtures). These alternative authorities are being explored
and a decision to pursue regulation of CKD under one or more of these statutes may form the basis for a decision that subtitle
C regulation of CKD may be limited or even unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether or not the Agency lifts the exemption, dust suppression and storm water management at facilities that burn
hazardous waste, as well as on-site CKD management practices at all other facilities would be subject to current and
potential future regulation under the Federal Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and where such provisions exist, all
applicable state laws and regulations. Damages at existing CKD disposal sites also could be addressed by RCRA section
7003 and CERCLA section 104 and 106, if the site posed an imminent and substantial danger to human health and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1: Retain the CKD Exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since CKD exhibits low inherent toxicity and poses minimal risk when evaluating the various exposure pathways using
average or best case conditions, it may be appropriate to retain the exemption for cement kiln dust waste, that is,
maintain the status quo. Under this option, CKD management would continue to be regulated by the States, if at all.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2: Retain the CKD Exemption, but enter into discussions with the industry, in which they voluntarily implement
dust recycling technologies, reduce waste, and monitor and control certain off-site uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since certain management scenarios may present risks when assuming plausible worst case conditions and pollution
prevention alternatives may be promising in certain instances, the Agency could enter into discussions with the
cement manufacturing industry to urge it to implement selected waste minimization/pollution prevention technologies
or implement, more environmentally protective management practices, including controlling certain off-site
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, some of the potential higher risk situations that have been identified in the hypothetical scenarios
relate to on-site CKD management and derive from CKD releases from waste piles or other points via wind-blown dust
or storm water runoff or a combination of the two. These contaminant release situations may be controllable (and at
some facilities are currently being controlled) at relatively low cost by careful location of the waste pile and active
use of conventional dust suppression and storm water management practices. The Agency would hold discussions with
the industry to encourage them to voluntarily agree to implement these practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exception to the above conclusion would appear to be the 15 percent or so of cement plants where CKD waste is managed
in areas of karst topography or other areas characterized by flow in fractured or cavernous bedrock, where leachate
may directly percolate to groundwater with little or no attenuation. For some of these facilities, the groundwater
pathway may become of increased concern, depending on other site specific considerations. Again, EPA would discuss
with the industry opportunities to either use appropriate liners or relocate the CKD management unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 20 percent of current net CKD generation is used off-site for a wide variety of purposes, most of which according
to the Agency's risk assessment do not pose human health or other risks. However, the use of raw CKD containing higher
measured levels of certain metals and/or dioxins as a direct substitute for lime on agricultural fields and gardens
can concentrate toxic constituents in crops and animal products at levels of concern for human health. This use of
CKD, though not widely practiced at present, is otherwise not currently controlled, and may warrant further consideration
by the Agency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency, under this option, could also develop guidance for States regarding site management, off-site uses,
and pollution prevention and waste minimization technologies. This guidance would assist States in reducing the
potential risks posed by mismanagement of CKD and recommend implementation of technologies that would promote recycling
of CKD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this option, CKD management would not be controlled by the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. However, since the
exemption for CKD remains in place, CKD generated in kilns that burn hazardous waste would still be subject to the two-part
test for residuals under 40 CFR 266.112. If CKD does not pass the two-part test, it would be treated to standards for
land disposal (40 CFR 268.43) and disposed in a subtitle C facility. Damages at existing CKD disposal sites would still
be addressed by RCRA section 7003 and CERCLA sections 104 and 106, if the site posed an imminent and substantial danger
to human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3: Remove the CKD Exemption but delay implementation for some period of time (e.g., two years), that would allow
industry time to employ pollution prevention options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While CKD may not present risks when evaluating the various exposure pathways using average or best case conditions,
CKD may pose a potential danger to human health and the environment if managed in certain ways under a limited set of
exposure pathways assuming plausible worst case conditions. Also, damages to the environment resulting from poor
CKD management practices have been recorded and are continuing to occur at some facilities. For these reasons, removing
the Bevill exemption (codified at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(8)) may be appropriate. Accordingly, provisions of the Boiler
and Industrial Furnace rule (40 CFR 266.112) would no longer apply to hazardous waste-derived CKD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this option, on-site CKD management practices at those facilities with dust that exhibited any of the RCRA hazardous
waste characteristics, or CKD derived from the burning of listed hazardous wastes (see 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)) would
be affected by the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. CKD disposal piles which are inactive on or before the effective date
of the Final Rule would be unaffected by the provisions of subtitle C, unless subsequently managed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By delaying lifting the exemption for some period of time (e.g., two years after the Regulatory Determination), industry
would be provided an opportunity to implement pollution prevention alternatives and thus, manage the hazardous
waste management costs they would incur. During this interim period between submittal of the Report to Congress and
the effective date of the Final Rule, the CKD exemption would still be in effect. The Agency believes that many of the
affected facilities would utilize the time to adopt pollution prevention technologies which would reduce, if not
eliminate the amount of hazardous CKD they generate or stop burning hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the exemption is removed, CKD generated from cement manufacturing facilities that burn RCRA hazardous wastes
would be RCRA hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). The goal of avoiding subtitle
C compliance costs would provide an incentive for each facility to look for pollution prevention alternatives to
recycle their CKD and reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated. The Agency is requesting additional information
on the viability of the CKD recycling options discussed in the RTC and any other available pollution prevention or
recycling option not considered in the Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those facilities that do not burn hazardous waste would not generally be affected by removing the exemption unless
they generated characteristic RCRA hazardous waste. The Agency expects the number of non-hazardous waste burning
facilities affected by this option would be small, since CKD rarely exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste.
These facilities would have an incentive to control their cement manufacturing process to avoid generating characteristic
CKD.

Option 4: Remove the CKD Exemption, and rely on existing hazardous waste rules to control cement kiln dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This option is similar to Option 3, except the exemption would be removed in accordance with RCRA section 3010(b).
(Under subtitle C of RCRA, wastes brought under regulatory control have up to six months from the Regulatory Determination
before they become subject to hazardous waste control.) Thus, CKD that is hazardous waste-derived or exhibits a RCRA
hazardous characteristic would be made subject to the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. Otherwise, this option is the
same as Option 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Option 5: Promulgate Regulatory Standards for the Management of CKD Waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated, the Agency's analysis of the risks associated with cement kiln dust suggest that by merely lifting
the exemption at 40 CFR 264.1(b)(8), certain pathways of potential concern under the hypothetical scenarios may
not be adequately addressed under Options 3 and 4, should EPA decide that subtitle C regulation is warranted for CKD
in the first instance. Specifically, EPA's risk assessment indicates indirect foodchain risks are of potential
concern from releases of CKD from disposal piles to nearby surface waters and crop lands and from the direct application
of CKD to croplands as a soil amendment assuming reasonable worst-case conditions. The Agency acknowledges, as discussed
in detail in Chapter 6, that these modelled risks, while plausible, are of probably minimal incidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, the likely regulatory result under Options 3 and 4 would be to make CKD generated by a kiln that burns
listed hazardous wastes itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). The indirect
foodchain risks potentially identified in this Report, however, are not associated only with CKD generated by hazardous
waste burning kilns. As a result, EPA is also considering regulatory mechanisms that would specifically address
these risks, including promulgating regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD waste that would
provide adequate protection against these risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C) provides that EPA shall within six months of the RTC ``determine to promulgate regulations
under this subchapter *&blank;*&blank;* or determine that such regulations are unwarranted.'' The statute does
not describe the type of regulation that EPA should consider promulgating (if any), other than that such regulation
be under subtitle C of RCRA. For example, RCRA does not expressly direct EPA to determine whether to list CKD as hazardous,
as required for other wastes under the mandates in RCRA section 3001(c). Furthermore, RCRA section 2002(a) gives
the Administrator the broad authority to ``prescribe *&blank;*&blank;* such regulations as are necessary to carry
out his functions under this chapter.'' The Agency believes it has the authority where appropriate to promulgate
Federally-enforceable regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD. EPA could explore mechanisms
for imposing regulatory standards for CKD, e.g., under grant of rulemaking authority under section 3001(b)(3)(C).
Alternatively, EPA could consider conditioning the CKD exemption from the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR
261.4(b)(8)) on compliance with appropriate management standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA could promulgate minimally burdensome management standards for cement kiln dust that would adequately control
the indirect foodchain risks, such as: (1) Requiring that dust piles be kept covered to control fugitive emissions
and institute surface water runoff and erosion controls; (2) maintaining groundwater protection, perhaps by requiring
that CKD piles be maintained on a non-earthen base or by requiring a liner; and (3) establishing risk-based concentration
thresholds for all constituents of concern (including 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) for CKD used
as a direct soil amendment. Additional or alternative standards may be appropriate, and EPA welcomes comments and
suggestions on this aspect of its options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the five options being considered by the Agency, Options 3, 4 and 5 would provide more control through implementation
of the provisions of subtitle C. The principal difference between Options 3 and 4 is the timing of the implementation
of the regulatory controls. Option 3 provides industry additional time to implement waste minimization/pollution
prevention options and more protective CKD management standards. Option 4 would bring CKD under subtitle C regulatory
control more quickly. Removing the exemption also would impose regulatory equity between CKD generated from kilns
that burn RCRA hazardous waste and residues from other incinerators that burn RCRA hazardous waste that do not have
such an exemption. Option 5 would provide management standards to control all CKD, and would be targeted to specifically
address only those risks of potential concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency did not evaluate the risk from the land application of agricultural lime, so it cannot determine whether
there is an increase in incremental risk when CKD is substituted. In any event, CKD-sewage sludge derived fertilizers
and soil amendments are considered safe for such uses as fertilizer and pose minimal risk because these final products
are required to be tested to assure they comply with all provisions of 40 CFR part 503, which are fully protective of
human health and the environment. It should be noted that if the exemption is removed, fertilizer that is derived from
CKD generated from a kiln that burns listed hazardous waste is itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule
(40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)); the extent of regulation, however, is limited (see 40 CFR 266.20(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it should also be noted that under current rules, if CKD is recycled, the resulting clinker is not automatically
subject to the provisions of subtitle C. By removing the exemption, however, clinker may be affected by the derived-from
rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)) if the kiln burns listed hazardous waste, thereby becoming a hazardous waste. The Agency
has not yet fully analyzed available data on trace constituents in clinker. Based on our understanding of current
data, however, the Agency does not believe that clinker produced from kilns that burn listed hazardous waste generally
poses a hazard to human health and the environment. The Agency is, therefore, considering crafting appropriate regulatory
language for clinker. The Agency, however, is interested in receiving comment on this issue.

Summary of Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed revisions (58 FR 54702) include the creation of Area Committees and Area Contingency Plans; a National
Response Unit to assist in coordinating spill removal resources, personnel, and equipment; and U.S. Coast Guard
District Response Groups to assist On-Scene Coordinators and maintain Coast Guard response equipment. In addition,
the NPRM includes criteria and procedures for responding to discharges that result in substantial threats to public
health or welfare; procedures and standards for preventing, mitigating, and removing worst case discharges; and
a new provision addressing spills of national significance. EPA also proposed to revise subpart J of the NCP, which
provides for a Product Schedule that lists dispersants, bioremediation agents, and other miscellaneous oil spill
control substances. The subpart J revisions would reflect new dispersant effectiveness testing and acceptability
criteria.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We propose to revise the definition of end-stage renal disease to reflect that more than one dialysis treatment is
required for there to be a ``regular course of dialysis'' and to require that generally accepted diagnostic criteria
and laboratory findings must form the basis of the physician's certification of end-stage renal disease. The purpose
of this proposed revision is to eliminate any misinterpretation of the definition of end-stage renal disease. We
propose to do so by clarifying that only those individuals whose kidneys have failed and for whom the disease is expected
to be a lifelong affliction are eligible for Medicare end-stage renal disease benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also propose to amend the regulations to specify that Medicare entitlement is resumed for individuals who again
begin a regular course of renal dialysis treatments after a previous course is terminated (with or without a transplant),
and to add the same considerations for those who have a second transplant. Therefore, the purpose of these proposed
revisions is to conform the regulations more closely to the intent of sections 226A (c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Social
Security Act regarding resumption of entitlement to Medicare.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a disease which occurs from the destruction of normal kidney tissues over a long
period of time. The individual often does not experience any symptoms until the kidney has lost more than half of its
function. The loss of kidney function in ESRD is usually irreversible and permanent.

A. Related Law and Regulations for Medicare Coverage of ESRD and the Definition of ESRD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 226A(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides for Medicare coverage for certain individuals who
are medically determined to have end-stage renal disease. Once an individual is medically determined to have ESRD,
section 226A(b) of the Act specifies that one of two conditions must be met before entitlement begins. That is, a regular
course of dialysis must begin or a kidney transplant must be performed. Section 226A(b)(1)(A) of the Act provides
that entitlement begins with the third month after the month in which a regular course of renal dialysis is initiated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not give a definition of ESRD; however, the Medicare regulations in title 42 of the Code of Federal
Regulations do define the term. The definition of ESRD is given in two sections of the regulations. For purposes of
Medicare eligibility and entitlement, ESRD is currently defined in &sect;406.13(b) as that stage of kidney impairment
that appears irreversible and permanent and requires a regular course of dialysis or kidney transplantation to maintain
life. A parallel definition of ESRD also appears in &sect;405.2102 which defines ESRD as it relates to the conditions
for coverage that must be met by suppliers furnishing ESRD care to Medicare beneficiaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Potential Misinterpretation of the Current ESRD Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calendar year 1989, 21,200 individuals were certified by their physicians as having an irreversible, permanent
kidney impairment and obtained Medicare entitlement solely because of this certification. That is, they could not
qualify for Medicare on any other basis, such as age or disability status. In calendar year 1990, the number of similar
new beneficiaries was 22,800. Soon after obtaining Medicare eligibility, nearly 1 percent of these individuals
terminated their course of dialysis with a return of kidney function. We are concerned that the diagnosis and certification
of ESRD for these individuals was incorrect. The regulations in &sect;&sect;405.2102 and 406.13(b) define ESRD
as a condition that appears irreversible and permanent; Medicare entitlement on the basis of the patient's need for
dialysis is usually terminated only if the individual dies or receives a kidney transplant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any severe kidney condition (particularly acute kidney failure) may appear to be irreversible and permanent if the
diagnosis is based on only limited tests and criteria. We believe that certifications for the patients who terminated
dialysis may have arisen from a misunderstanding of the extent of the kidney failure which constitutes ESRD for which
the law grants Medicare entitlement. We believe that specifying that the diagnosis must be based on generally accepted
diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings may result in not enrolling in Medicare those patients whose renal disease
is not ``end-stage''. However, we do not wish to eliminate the word, ``appears,'' from the regulation since the law
recognizes that dialysis treatments may end in some ESRD cases.

C. Related Laws and Regulations for Termination of Medicare Entitlement and Resumption of Entitlement to ESRD Benefits

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 226A(b)(2) of the Act specifies that Medicare entitlement for individuals on the basis of ESRD terminates
with the end of the 36th month after the month of transplant or with the end of the 12th month after the last month of renal
dialysis treatments. Section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act specifically provides for beginning a new period of
entitlement when a kidney transplant fails or a course of renal dialysis begins again, whether during or after the
36 or 12 months, as applicable. Current regulations in &sect;406.13(f) address these situations by specifying that
entitlement does not end as scheduled if the treatment begins again during the applicable periods. The regulations
in &sect;406.13(g) deal with resumption of entitlement after termination of entitlement has occurred and require
the submission of a new application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the provisions in section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act ensure that resumption of entitlement to Medicare
will begin without the 3-month waiting period that usually applies in cases when Medicare entitlement is sought on
the basis of dialysis (except for certain cases involving self-care training).

II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Proposed Revision to ESRD Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We analyzed the payment records of patients who terminated dialysis shortly after becoming eligible for Medicare
based on a diagnosis of ESRD. Our records indicate an annual mean cost per patient of approximately $8,000, which is
significantly below the average annual cost of $40,000 for a patient who remains on dialysis. Because these individuals
were able to discontinue dialysis shortly after beginning a course of treatment and incurred only limited medical
costs, we believe that many of these patients may have been incorrectly certified as having ESRD as a result of physicians
misinterpreting the ESRD definition as it appears in &sect;406.13(b). We also find the current ESRD definition (&sect;406.13(b))
inadequate for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) eligibility and entitlement purposes because entitlement
to Medicare based on ESRD depends on the existence of ESRD, not on the sole fact that dialysis treatments are being given.
Therefore, in order to eliminate any possible misinterpretation, we propose to revise the definition of ESRD in &sect;406.13(b).
After the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* a regular course of dialysis'', we propose to add the word ``treatments''.
This revision would clarify that more than one dialysis treatment is required for there to be a regular course of dialysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to add to the end of the definition of ESRD, the phrase ``as evidenced by generally accepted diagnostic
criteria and laboratory findings''. We believe that requiring generally accepted diagnostic criteria and laboratory
findings as the basis for diagnosis of ESRD serves as a reminder to physicians that they must have medical evidence
to substantiate their certification of ESRD. We do not believe this addition to the definition would have a substantial
effect on most physicians since they already depend on such medical information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe it is necessary to add the word ``treatments'' or the phrase ``as evidenced by generally accepted
diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings'' to the definition of ESRD in &sect;405.2102, which defines ESRD as
it relates to the conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services. This is because that section does not establish
who is eligible or entitled to Medicare ESRD benefits, which is the purpose of this proposed rule.

B. Proposed Revisions to the Termination of Entitlement and to the Resumption of Entitlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act specifies the conditions for beginning a new period of entitlement when a
kidney transplant fails or a regular course of dialysis begins again. However, this section refers to those instances
when entitlement has not yet ended and specifies that Part A entitlement ``begins'' (although it may not yet have ended)
with the month when regular dialysis treatments begin again. The importance of ``beginning'' Part A entitlement
is that it offers the opportunity for those who do not have Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) entitlement to
enroll in Part B without waiting for the annual general enrollment period (January through March). Supplementary
Medical Insurance is a voluntary program available to most individuals age 65 or over and to disabled individuals
who are under age 65 and entitled to Medicare Part A. In addition, since Part A entitlement has not ended, we believe
that the intention is to re-enroll the individual in Part A with that month, without a new application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we propose to treat the situation where dialysis or transplant recurs during the 12-month or 36-month
periods as a resumption of entitlement. Accordingly, we delete from &sect;406.13(f) the reference to continuation
of entitlement, and instead revise &sect;406.13(g), which specifies the conditions for resumption of entitlement,
to include this situation where coverage resumes despite a previous course of treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to revise &sect;406.13(g) to state that entitlement would be resumed under any one of three conditions.
Using the language we propose to remove from paragraph (f), a new period of entitlement would begin if an individual
initiates a regular course of renal dialysis during the 12-month period after the previous course of dialysis ended,
and he or she would be entitled to resume Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B benefits effective with the
month the regular course of dialysis is resumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not mention the beginning of a new period of entitlement when a second kidney transplant occurs during
the 36-month period following the initial transplant, since there is never a waiting period for entitlement based
on a transplant. However, we believe that, by analogy, the provisions for beginning a new period of entitlement in
cases where a regular course of dialysis begins or recurs during the 36 months indicate that we should construe the
law as requiring resumption of entitlement and a new period of Part B enrollment in cases of re-transplantation that
occur without the beneficiary's resuming (or initiating) dialysis treatments. We, therefore, propose to revise
&sect;406.13(g) to state that entitlement would begin when an individual initiates a new, regular course of renal
dialysis, or has a kidney transplant, during the 36-month period after an earlier kidney transplant, and that he or
she would be entitled to resume Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B benefits effective with the month the
regular course of dialysis begins or with the month the subsequent kidney transplant occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to make technical revisions to &sect;406.13(g) to clarify the other condition for resumption of entitlement.
That is, entitlement is resumed if an individual initiates a regular course of renal dialysis more than 12 months after
the previous regular course of dialysis ended or more than 36 months after the month of a kidney transplant, and the
individual is eligible to enroll in Part A and Part B benefits effective with the month in which the regular course of
dialysis treatment is resumed. If he or she is otherwise entitled to Part A benefits under the conditions specified
in &sect;406.13(c), and files an application, entitlement would begin with the month in which dialysis treatments
are initiated or resumed, without a waiting period, subject to the basic limitations of entitlement in &sect;406.13(e)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised definition of ESRD in &sect;406.13(b) and revisions to resumption of entitlement in &sect;406.13(g)
would also be used as the basis for eligibility for Medicare Part B. This is because, in accordance with &sect;407.10(a)(1),
an individual who qualifies for Medicare Part A on the basis of ESRD is also eligible for Medicare Part B.

When we publish these proposed requirements as a final rule, the Social Security Program Operations Manual System,
Part 6, ``HI''; the Medicare Part A Intermediary Manual, Part 3, ``Claims Processing''; the Medicare Part B Carriers
Manual, Part 3, ``Claims Processing''; and the Medicare Renal Dialysis Facilities Manual, would be revised to reflect
the changes made to the definition of ESRD and the resumption of entitlement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no information collection requirements. Consequently, this rule need not be reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified
in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and if we proceed with the final rule, we will respond to the comments in the
preamble to the final rule.

V. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calendar year 1989, over 21,200 individuals were certified by their physicians as having an irreversible, permanent
kidney impairment, and obtained Medicare entitlement solely on the basis of this certification. In 1990, that number
was 22,800. As reported in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease's U.S. Renal Data System
Annual Data Report, approximately 1 percent of individuals receiving dialysis treatments during these years were
able to terminate their course of dialysis treatment because kidney function returned. This figure is consistent
with data that we maintain on the number of individuals whose Medicare eligibility terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We analyzed the Medicare payment records of beneficiaries whose sole reason for Medicare entitlement was ESRD, and
who discontinued dialysis (and thus, Medicare eligibility) within 2 years after enrollment. Our records indicate
that 70 percent of the individuals incurred annual costs of less than $10,000, with an annual mean cost per beneficiary
to the Medicare program of approximately $8,000. This is significantly below the average annual cost to the Medicare
program of $40,000 for a patient receiving regular dialysis treatments. Because these beneficiaries were able to
discontinue dialysis after incurring only limited medical costs, we believe that most of these patients may have
been incorrectly certified as having ESRD, which requires long-term maintenance dialysis or a kidney transplant.
Although the number of individuals who may have been incorrectly certified was less than 250 per year, they accounted
for nearly $2 million in annual Medicare program expenditures. These expenditures were unintended because the disease
did not reach ``end-stage'' in these individuals. As a result of this proposed revision, we estimate the projected
savings to the Medicare program for the next 5 calendar years to be as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the portion of this proposed rule concerning resumption or continuation of entitlement after a terminating
event, we have no reason to believe, based on 13 years' experience, that more than one or two people would have had their
entitlement resumed earlier under the proposed revised regulation relating to that issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all physicians and dialysis
facilities to be small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No additional time burden or monetary requirements would be placed on physicians or dialysis facilities in order
to comply with the provisions of this proposed rule since physicians should already have appropriate laboratory
findings and generally accepted diagnostic criteria to confirm a diagnosis of ESRD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, changes in the resumption of entitlement regulations would have no effect on physicians or on dialysis
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result
in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or on the operations of a substantial number
of small rural hospitals. We are, therefore, not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise Onshore Oil and Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order No. 5 under 43 CFR 3164.1, originally issued February 24, 1989 (54 FR 8100), and made effective March 27, 1989,
for new facilities, August 23, 1989, for existing facilities measuring 200 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) or more per day
of gas, and February 26, 1990, for existing facilities producing less than 200 Mcf per day of gas. This proposed revision
would reorganize the Order to make it more logical in sequence, remove unnecessary provisions, resolve internal
inconsistencies discovered in the Order, and clarify certain provisions. These changes are based on several years
of experience implementing the Order, and on suggestions from the public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Order No. 5, Measurement of Gas, implements and supplements requirements found in 43 CFR Part 3160 relating to the
measurement of gas produced under the terms of Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil and gas leases, as well as gas produced
from State or privately owned lands when Federal and/or Indian leases receive a share of such production under the
terms of an approved agreement. The Order addresses gas measurement by orifice meter and gas measurement by other
methods acceptable to the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Gas measurement by electronic
flow computers, utilizing an orifice, which calculate volume using the equations specified by the American Gas Association
(AGA) Committee Report No. 3, may be implemented without prior approval if the minimum standards outlined in the Order
are adhered to.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several years of experience implementing the Order have revealed some areas where the organization of the Order can
be improved, and certain provisions that require amendment or clarification or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statement of the purpose of the Order in section I.B. is proposed to be amended to remove the reference to the assessments
and penalties imposed as a result of noncompliance or the failure to correct noncompliance, because the Order does
not set forth such assessments and penalties. The purpose statement also is proposed to be amended to include the purpose
that measurements be accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no amendments proposed in the definitions included in the existing Order. However, one new definition (meter
uncertainty) would be added in this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section III.A. on Required Recordkeeping is proposed to be amended by adding requirements for the retention of data
generated by electronic flow computers. The revised Order would set forth specifically the kinds of data required
to be retained, without prescribing an exhaustive list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article III. would be reorganized in the proposed Order. Two new sections would be added to cover minimum standards
specific to the secondary element of the orifice meter and to allow the use of other types of secondary elements, and
to cover other requirements not specific to orifice meters or the secondary element. Requirements included in section
C. on orifice meters are proposed to be moved, and in some cases amended, as part of the new section D. on secondary elements
or section E. on other requirements, and several new requirements have been added as part of section C. and new section
D. These changes are stated in table form below.

The automatic exemption from some requirements for meters measuring 100 Mcf per day or less on a monthly basis would
be expanded to include 3 additional standards. These added exemptions would include the existing requirement that
the static element be sized to make the pen that records the static pressure operate in the outer 2/3 of the chart range
for the majority of the flowing period, the new requirement that electronic flow computers be installed, operated,
and maintained to achieve an overall meter uncertainty of plus or minus 3 percent, and the new requirement for inspecting
meter tubes every 5 years. Language has been added to the Order identifying the applicable standards for the exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following requirements proposed to be amended in revised Order No. 5 are discussed below in the order they appear
in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.5. (formerly C.8.) is proposed to be amended purely for clarification. It is the difference between the internal
diameters of the meter tube pipe and the orifice fittings that is to be within AGA tolerance limits, not the diameters
themselves, as the existing Order seems to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.6. (new) is added to ensure that the meter tubes conform with AGA Committee Report No. 3. Proper meter tube condition
is essential for accurate measurement. It is intended that all meter tube inspections would be conducted within the
first 5 years after the effective date of the final rule, and every 5 years thereafter. Meters measuring 100 Mcf per
day or less on a monthly basis would be exempt from this new requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.8. (formerly C.10.) is proposed to be amended for precision in stating the requirement. As stated in this rule,
orifice plates would be required to be inspected during calibration of the secondary element.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
III.C.10. (formerly C.12.) is proposed to be amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the requirement that, when leaks are detected, the meter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting shall be determined and recorded ``as found,'' and ``as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left'' after the meter is calibrated. This part of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is duplicated by the linearity test in requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.3. of the proposed Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.13. in the existing Order would be removed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Order because it is duplicated by the linearity test in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement III.D.3. of the proposed Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.11. (formerly C.21.) would be amended by revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action to provide for the submittal of a report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLM. The form called for in existing requirement C.21. is now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Minerals Management Service, not to the BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the operator would be required to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a report to the BLM showing what corrections were made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.1. (formerly C.7.) would be amended by removing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision allowing consideration of a variance for sales or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation meters measuring between 200 and 500 Mcf per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision duplicates the general provision for a variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Article IV. of the Order. The requirement for the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an indicating thermometer would be removed because when using an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating thermometer the temperature is not a true average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flowing temperature. All meters measuring more than 100 Mcf per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day are required to have a temperature recorder. Meters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring 100 Mcf per day or less are required to use either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recorder or an average flowing temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.2. (new) would ensure that the accuracy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recording device is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.3. (formerly C.15.) would be amended for clarification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to require the recording of readings before and after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments are made. The words ``of the element range'' would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to make it clear what the 0 and 100 percent refer to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.4. (new) would be added to require calibration equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be more accurate than the equipment being calibrated. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing equipment is not more accurate than the equipment being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrated, the inherent uncertainty in the metering equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.5. (new) would be added to require documentation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification or recertification of calibration equipment to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the authorized officer at the time of calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.6. (formerly C.17.) would be amended to allow meters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that measure 100 Mcf or less per day to be inspected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrated semiannually rather than quarterly. Experience has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shown that quarterly inspections and calibrations of meters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring such low volumes are neither cost effective nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to assure an acceptable degree of accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.7. (formerly C.18.) would be amended to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators to notify the authorized officer of the BLM well in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance of calibrations to enable the planning of inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.8. (formerly C.19.) would be amended by changing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to ``measuring equipment'' to ``recording device'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform with changes in other requirements. The current Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that an adjustment be made whenever a volume error of 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or greater occurs. It is proposed to change this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard to ``more than 1 percent'' because volume errors of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 2 percent on higher volume wells are very significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in most instances, it will be the policy of the BLM not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pursue volume errors of less than 200 Mcf per month, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost of doing so would exceed the value of any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
royalty that might result. The requirement that the meter be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted to zero error would be removed because this is part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the linearity test requirement in Section III.D.3. For the sake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of simplicity, the abatement period would be stated as 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only rather than also stating the alternative ``prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of calibration.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.10. would be added combining several requirements from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing Order, as explained below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.10.a. (formerly C.4.) would be revised to clarify what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is meant by the outer 2/3 of the chart range. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to sizing the orifice would be removed because doing so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not the only alternative available to the operator to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the differential pen in the outer 2/3 of the chart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
III.D.10.b. (formerly C.5.) would be revised to clarify what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is meant by the outer 2/3 of the chart range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.10.c. (formerly C.14.) would be amended by revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action. It would no longer require recordation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``as found'' and ``as left'' readings, which are meaningless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.11.a., b., and c. (new) would be added as requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Electronic Flow Computers (EFCs). The requirements for EFCs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be no more stringent than those for chart recorders. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current static pressure, differential pressure, and temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be displayed on a continuous basis, and the EFC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to have a back-up power source capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retaining data collected for a minimum of 35 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.E.3. and 4. (formerly C.25. and 26.) would be amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make them read as requirements rather than as descriptions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions, as they appear to do in the existing Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other editorial changes have been proposed to correct errors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing Order and cross-references that must be changed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the proposed reorganization of the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal authors of this proposed rule are Lonny R.

Larry Bray, Petroleum Engineering Technician, Roswell Resource

Area Office, New Mexico, assisted by the staff of the Division of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legislation and Regulatory Management, all of the BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby determined that this proposed rule does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land Management has determined that this proposed rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 516 Departmental Manual (DM), Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that the proposal would not significantly affect the 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant effect on the human environment and that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that it will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same reasons. The rule codifies industry standards that apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all entities in the industry, regardless of size. The Order would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not require a substantial amount of additional information or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring. Some additional equipment may be required in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, but the total cost of these changes would not approach the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold specified in the Executive Order. Costs to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not increase at all as a result of the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department certifies that this proposed rule does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent a governmental action capable of interference with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutionally protected property rights. There would be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking of private property without due process. Failure to abate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations could result in assessments under the Mineral Leasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act and/or penalties under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Act, and possibly lease cancellation if the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continues, but not without due process. Therefore, as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the proposed rule would not cause a taking of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in section 1(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12788. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirement(s) contained in Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3160 that relate to this Order have been approved by the Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

the Secretary of the Interior under various Federal and Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral leasing statutes and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Act of 1982. This authority has been delegated to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau of Land Management and is implemented by the onshore oil

Section 3164.1 thereof specifically authorizes the Director to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue Onshore Oil and Gas Orders when necessary to implement or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement the operating regulations and provides that all such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Orders shall be binding on the lessees and operators of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and restricted Indian oil and gas leases which have been, or may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hereafter, be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific authority for the provisions contained in this Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One purpose of this Order is to establish requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standards for the accurate measurement of gas by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods authorized in 43 CFR 3162.7&hyph;3, i.e., measurement by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orifice meter or other methods acceptable to the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer. Accurate gas measurement ensures that the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government, the general public, State Governments that share in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proceeds, and Indian mineral owners receive the royalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due, as specified in the governing oil and gas leases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another purpose of this Order is to establish abatement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods for corrective action when noncompliance with the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards is detected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Order also serves as notice to any party cited for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance that it may request from the authorized officer an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the abatement period for any violation, provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the request for extension is applied for and granted prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the expiration of the abatement period previously allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order is applicable to all Federal and Indian (except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Osage) oil and gas leases. In addition, this Order is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all wells and facilities on State or privately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owned mineral lands committed to a unit or communitization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement that affects Federal or Indian interests, notwithstanding any provision of a unit or communitization
agreement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contrary.

III. Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Required Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The operator shall keep all test data, meter reports, charts/recordings, or other similar records for 6 years from
the date they were generated, unless the operator is notified that an audit or investigation involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such records has been initiated. If the operator is notified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an audit or investigation involving the records has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiated, the operator shall maintain the records until released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in writing from the obligation to maintain them. The authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may request, and the operator shall produce, such records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time within this period. For electronic flow computers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EFCs), this includes but is not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Field edits or volume adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Hourly average static and differential pressures, hourly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow temperatures, hourly sums of extensions calculated at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data point, hourly volumes, and the method used to obtain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summation of extensions, averages, and volumes. For the purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this Order, extensions are the square root of the product of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the differential pressure and static pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Subsequent edits or adjustments. If several changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made, only the original and the final readings shall be retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with any records submitted at the request of the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer, the operator shall provide all additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to compute volumes so that computations may be verified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All gas production shall be measured in accordance with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized method of measurement. As set out in 43 CFR 3162.7&hyph;3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas measurement authorized for gas produced from leases, unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, and communitization agreements subject to the jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Bureau of Land Management, as such jurisdiction is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 43 CFR 3161.1, may be by orifice meter or other methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to the authorized officer. The requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standards for gas measurement are set out below. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements for the primary element and chart recorder are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met, a meter accuracy of plus or minus 3 percent will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attained. However, given the complex components and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sophistication of electronic flow computers (EFCs), no ``cook 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
book'' method can be established. Therefore, an uncertainty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of plus or minus 3 percent would be included for EFCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of this Order are based on the standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications published by the American Gas Association (AGA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and officially designated as ANSI/API 2530 and AGA Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report No. 3, second edition, 1985, hereafter referred to as AGA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee Report No. 3. The AGA-published standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications are considered to be appropriate for proper gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement by both the Department of the Interior and the oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas industry. The requirements set minimum standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to promote conservation of natural resources and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure proper measurement of gas production for sales and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation purposes, so that the Federal Government and Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral owners will receive the royalties due under governing oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas leases.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All future sales and allocation facilities and sales or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation facilities in existence on the effective date of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order, unless covered by a valid variance, shall meet the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards prescribed in this Order; provided, however, that all gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced from or allocated to Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas leases wherein the gas is measured through sales or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation meters handling 100 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less on a monthly basis are exempt from the standards in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. C.1., C.2., D.10.a., D.10.b., and D.11.c. of this Order. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized officer may, where appropriate and necessary for proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement, work with the operators in designating consolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas sales and/or allocation meter stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meter installations constructed in accordance with the AGA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee Report No. 3 standards in effect at that time shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically be required to retrofit if the standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised. The Bureau will review any revised standards and, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, will amend the Order through the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of these minimum standards is to ensure that when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment malfunctions occur that could result in inaccurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement, proper corrective actions are taken, the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer is notified, and a report is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to comply with these minimum standards will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered noncompliance and an incident of noncompliance (INC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be issued. Operators who discover noncompliance with these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standards and take immediate corrective action will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued an INC. If the authorized officer or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative is present when an operator discovers a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
malfunction or uses incorrect procedures as specified in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order, an INC will be issued unless immediate corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is taken. Failure of equipment will not be considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation. However, the incidents of noncompliance which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from equipment failure are considered violations. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partial list of such incidents follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to install equipment properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to repair or correct equipment malfunction properly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to submit report of alternate method of sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to submit required reports in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to adhere to the minimum standard procedures specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of improper equipment, when discovered, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a violation and a formal INC will be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of improper procedures will be considered a violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and when witnessed by the authorized officer or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative, immediate corrective action will be required. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the event that proper procedures are then used as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Order, and prior to completing the operation, calibration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or proving, the violation will be considered as properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected. In this case, although the violation will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented in the agency files, no INC will be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure to take timely corrective action as required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet any standard in this article will be considered either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major or minor violation in accordance with the classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set out below for each standard, unless an applicable variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been granted or the standards have been otherwise modified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Article IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major violation, as defined in this Order, will generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an immediate shut-in of the metering device. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the non-recoupable loss is not significant or where damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the resource is likely to occur if a shut-in is required, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abatement period of 24 hours may be granted by the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer or his representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where abatement is required ``prior to sales or removal,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is required to be taken so that no gas can be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the measurement point until properly measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Variances From Minimum Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An operator may request that the authorized officer approve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance from any of the minimum standards prescribed in Article 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. All such requests shall be submitted in writing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate authorized officer and shall provide information as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the circumstances warranting approval of the variance(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested and the proposed alternative means by which the related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standard(s) will be satisfied. The authorized officer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after considering all relevant factors, shall approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested variance(s) if it is determined that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative(s) meets or exceeds the objectives of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standard(s), or does not adversely affect royalty income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or production accountability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, approval may be given orally by the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer before the operator initiates actions which require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance from minimum standards. The oral request, if granted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be followed by a written request not later than the fifth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business day following oral approval, and written approval will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authorized officer may also issue NTLs that establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified standards and requirements for specific geographic areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After notice to the operator, the authorized officer may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require compliance with standards that exceed those contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Order whenever such additional requirements are necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve protection of royalty income or production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountability. The rationale for any such additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements shall be documented in writing to the operator.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is considering whether to undertake rulemaking to develop standards for vessel rebuild determinations.
In order to help it determine whether rulemaking is needed and the scope of the issues involved, the Coast Guard conducted
a public meeting on November 16, 1993. At the meeting, attendees discussed problems encountered under existing procedures
and possible solutions, and whether use of a negotiated rulemaking would be appropriate. The meeting attendees requested
that the Coast Guard conduct a second meeting to further discuss the issues. This notice announces the date, time,
and place of the second meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 U.S.C. app. 883), a vessel entitled to engage in the coastwise
trade by virtue of having been built in the United States which is later rebuilt outside the United States, loses its
eligibility to engage in the coastwise trade. Under 46 U.S.C. 12106, a vessel not eligible for the coastwise trade
cannot receive a Great Lakes endorsement on its Certificate of Documentation. In addition, under 46 U.S.C. 12108,
a fishing vessel which has been rebuilt outside the United States and which does not qualify for the rebuild savings
provision of the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987, is not eligible for a fishery endorsement
on its Certificate of Documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective January 1, 1994, the Coast Guard's regulatory standard for rebuild determinations will be found in 46 CFR
&sect;67.177. (See final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 issue of Monday, November 15, 1993, page 60256.) In accordance with that standard, a vessel is rebuilt when ``any considerable
part of its hull or superstructure is built upon or is substantially altered.'' A determination that a vessel has been
rebuilt, if the rebuilding was done outside the U.S., results in a permanent loss of the eligibility of the vessel to
engage in the restricted trades, with a commensurate loss in value. At the present time none of the problematic terms
contained in the regulatory standard are defined. As a result, the Coast Guard frequently receives requests for advisory
opinions that certain work to be performed on a vessel does not constitute a rebuilding. In support of a request for
a rebuild determination, the submitter will generally enclose extensive documentation addressing the character
and scope of the work to be performed including plans, drawings, contracts, work orders, and materials lists. Then
the submitter will attempt to show that the work will not build upon or ``substantially'' alter ``any considerable
part'' of the vessel's hull or superstructure. Often, the submitter will make comparisons between the before and
after area of the hull and superstructure; the weight and area of steel plate to be replaced or added; or the comparative
cost of the planned work to the value of the vessel. Unfortunately, the vessel representative sometimes does not submit
any documentation until after the work is performed only to have the Coast Guard determine that the vessel has been
rebuilt, with the disastrous consequence of loss of trading entitlements. In other cases, the work actually done
on the vessel differs from or exceeds the planned work, with possible adverse effects on the final determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard is considering initiating rulemaking to develop standards for determining when work on a vessel constitutes
a rebuilding and to define the terms involved in rebuild determinations. However, to assist it to determine the scope
of the issues involved in the project and to receive suggested definitions and standards for consideration, the Coast
Guard conducted a public meeting before proceeding with the rulemaking process. At the meeting held on November 16,
1993, the attendees requested time to consider the information and ideas shared at the meeting and the opportunity
to submit written materials to the Coast Guard. In addition, the attendees requested that the Coast Guard schedule
a second meeting to further discuss the issues involved, including whether the use of negotiated rulemaking would
be appropriate. The Coast Guard agreed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to have sufficient time to review written submissions prior to the meeting, all materials should be received
by the Coast Guard on or before January 31, 1994. Attendees are encouraged to share written submissions with other
attendees. An attendance list with addresses for this purpose may be obtained by contacting the person identified

1. This action extends the deadline for filing reply comments in response to the Notice of Inquiry in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;254,
8 FCC Rcd 7277 (1993), in which the Commission seeks comment on whether the public interest would be served by establishing
limits on the amount of commercial matter broadcast by television stations. The Commission adopted the Notice on
its own motion. Comments were due by December 20, 1993, and the deadline for reply comments was January 5, 1994.

2. The Center for the Study of Commercialism, the Center for Media Education, the Consumer Federation of America,
and the Office of Communication of the United Church for Christ (the parties) request a 30-day extension of the reply
comment period in order to address adequately the matters asserted in the comments. The parties state that the reply
comment period extends over the seasonal holidays, providing insufficient time in which to prepare an adequate reply.
In addition, they state that their co-counsel, a clinical legal education program at a local law school, lacks the
staff to prepare reply comments during the school holiday.

The parties also state that an extension will allow the Commission to supplement the Notice. Specifically, they request
that two pending petitions for rulemaking, both of which concern the Commission's rules on commercial sponsorship
identification, be incorporated into this proceeding. However, we believe that the issues raised in the petitions
for rulemaking are best addressed separately by the Commission. Accordingly, we decline to extend the range of issues
addressed in this proceeding.

3. In light of the foregoing, the Bureau finds that good cause exists for an extension. Grant of the request will provide
the Commission a more substantial record upon which to base its findings. Therefore, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.283, the
deadline for filing reply comments is extended until February 4, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 3, 1991, the Regional Administrator for Region IX of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disapproved
certain water quality criteria contained in the Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta Estuary, that was adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board on May 1, 1991. These
criteria were disapproved because they failed to protect the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife
uses of the estuary. Under the authority of section 303 of the Clean Water Act, this document proposes a rule establishing
three sets of federal criteria to protect the designated uses of the estuary: salinity criteria protecting the Estuarine
Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses, a second set of salinity criteria (measured in electrical conductivity)
to protect the Fish Spawning (Striped Bass) designated use in the lower San Joaquin River, and a set of salmon smolt
survival index criteria to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the estuary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 303 of the Clean Water Act, as amended (hereinafter CWA or the Act), requires each state to adopt water quality
standards consisting of designated uses and instream water quality criteria to protect such uses for all waters of
the United States located within that state. Section 303(c) of the Act provides that states shall review and, if appropriate,
revise the water quality standards at least once every three years. Any new or revised standards adopted by the state
are to be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency). In
the event that EPA disapproves a state's standards, and the state does not make EPA's requested changes within ninety
(90) days of the disapproval, or if EPA determines at any time that revised or new standards are necessary to meet the
requirements of the Act, section 303(c)(4) of the Act states that the Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish
proposed regulations establishing water quality standards for the applicable waterbodies. The Administrator
shall promulgate any new or revised standards not later than ninety (90) days after publication of the proposed standards.
EPA's regulations for implementing section 303(c) of the Act are codified at 40 CFR part 131. Guidance for implementing
these regulations is contained in the Water Quality Standards Handbook (December 1983) and Technical Support Manual:
Waterbody Surveys and Assessments for Conducting Use Attainability Analyses (Volumes I, II and III).

EPA's proposal is part of a coordinated federal interagency response to the water management issues in the San Francisco
Bay and Delta. EPA has worked closely with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS), and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) to develop a comprehensive, habitat-oriented approach
to water and fish and wildlife resource management issues in California. Other components of this interagency initiative
are being announced contemporaneously with EPA's proposal. These include USFWS actions on petitions to list the
longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail as endangered fish species under the Federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C.
&sect;&sect;1531 to 1540 (ESA), the USFWS proposal of critical habitat for the Delta smelt under the ESA, and the NMFS
reclassification of the winter-run Chinook salmon as endangered under the ESA.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta estuary (hereinafter the Bay/Delta) is the West Coast's
largest estuary. It encompasses roughly 1600 square miles, and drains over 40 percent of California. The Bay/Delta
is the point of convergence of California's two major river systems_the Sacramento River system flowing southward
and draining a large part of northern California, and the San Joaquin River system flowing northward and draining
a large part of central California. These two rivers, together with a number of smaller rivers flowing directly westward
from the mountains, come together in a network of channels and islands, roughly a triangle 90 miles on each side, known
as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The rivers converge at the western tip of the Delta, forming an estuary as fresh
water mixes with marine water through a series of bays, channels, shoals and marshes and ultimately flowing into San
Francisco Bay and then to the Pacific Ocean. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bay/Delta constitutes one of the largest systems for fish production in the country, supplying habitat for over
120 fish species. It also comprises one of the largest areas of waterfowl habitat in the United States, providing a
stopover for more than one-half of the waterfowl and shorebirds migrating on the Pacific Flyway. Within the boundaries
of the Bay/Delta is the Suisun Marsh, the largest brackish marsh on the West Coast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bay/Delta is also the hub of California's two major water distribution systems_the Central Valley Project (CVP)
built and operated by the USBR and the State of California's State Water Project (SWP). Most of the State's developed
water_75 to 85 percent_is used for irrigation purposes by agriculture, irrigating over 4.5 million acres throughout
the State. The Bay/Delta watershed also provides part or all of the drinking water supply for over 18 million people.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Located solely within the State of California, the Bay/Delta is subject under state law to the water quality control
jurisdiction of the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) and two regional boards, the Central
Valley and San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Under the California regulatory scheme, the State
Board's actions preempt regional board actions to the extent of any conflicts. Cal. Water Code &sect;13170. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1978, the State Board adopted and submitted to EPA a Water Quality Control Plan (hereinafter the 1978 Delta Plan)
containing a comprehensive set of water quality standards to protect the designated uses of the Bay/Delta. The 1978
Delta Plan included water quality standards for three categories of designated uses: municipal and industrial,
agriculture, and fish and wildlife.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1978 Delta Plan relied on a key set of criteria to protect fish and wildlife uses: the striped bass spawning and survival
criteria. These criteria were established to provide minimum salinity and flow conditions to protect the fishery
at levels that would have existed in the absence of the State and federal water projects (the so-called ``without projects''
level). The striped bass survival criteria were based on a statistical correlation between a Striped Bass Index (SBI)
(a measure of the relative abundance of young striped bass in the estuary) and two hydrological variables: (1) Delta
outflow (freshwater flowing through the Delta out to the ocean), and (2) Delta diversions (freshwater diverted out
of the Delta channels for consumptive uses in agricultural irrigation, municipal and industrial uses). Based on
this relationship, flow (measured in cubic feet per second (cfs) of Delta outflow) and salinity requirements at critical
points in the Bay/Delta were adopted as criteria. The SBI, although not a formal criteria, was used to measure and predict
the substantive environmental results of implementing these flow and salinity criteria. The 1978 Delta Plan emphasized
striped bass protection because of the economic importance and availability of scientific information on this species
in the Bay/Delta, but the Plan also indicated that it considered the striped bass standards to be a surrogate for protection
of other species.

The CWA and implementing regulations describe the two components of water quality standards as ``designated uses''
and ``water quality criteria'' (40 CFR 131.3(i)), whereas California uses the terms ``beneficial uses'' and ``objectives''.
It has been EPA's and California's longstanding practice to interpret these terms synonymously. To avoid confusion,
this proposal will use the federal terms ``designated uses'' and ``criteria''.

Pursuant to its obligations under section 303(c)(3) of the Act, EPA reviewed the 1978 Delta Plan in 1980. While EPA
approved the Plan, it was concerned that the 1978 Delta Plan standards would not provide adequate protection of striped
bass and the estuary's fishery resources. EPA therefore conditioned its approval upon a set of ``interpretations''
of the standards, including commitments by the State Board to review and revise the 1978 Delta Plan standards immediately
if there were measurable adverse impacts on striped bass spawning, or if necessary to attain ``without project''
levels of protection for the striped bass (as defined by an SBI value of 79). EPA also conditioned its approval on the
State Board's commitment to develop additional criteria to protect aquatic life and tidal wetlands in and surrounding
the Suisun Marsh. The State Board concurred with these interpretations in its letter to EPA dated November 21, 1980.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the years since the 1978 Delta Plan was adopted, these standards have not accomplished the intended goal of maintaining
the SBI at a long term average of 79, the 1978 Delta Plan's estimate of ``without project'' levels. Indeed, during the
1980's, the SBI averaged approximately 7.5, and in 1983 and 1985 reached all-time lows of 1.2 and 2.2. Some of the decline
in the SBI may be attributable to drought conditions in the late 1970's and again in the late 1980's. However, the highest
SBI values actually attained since the 1978 Delta Plan was adopted were only in the teens and 20's, a substantial shortfall
from the stated goal of 79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The precipitous decline in striped bass is indicative of the poor health of other aquatic resources in the estuary.
Several species have experienced similar declines, including chinook salmon (the winter-run of chinook salmon
is listed as a threatened species under the ESA, and is currently proposed for reclassification as endangered), Delta
smelt (recently listed as a threatened species under the ESA) and Sacramento splittail and longfin smelt (both the
subject of a recent petition for listing as endangered species). The California Department of Fish and Game (California
DFG) recently testified that virtually all of the estuary's major fish species are in clear decline. (CDFG 1992b,

As fishery resources continued to decline, EPA on several occasions expressed its concern to the State Board about
the need for standards to adequately protect these resources. Throughout the first and second triennial reviews
ending in 1981 and 1985, EPA urged the State Board to review and revise the 1978 Delta Plan in accordance with EPA's 1980
approval letter. At the conclusion of each triennial review, the State Board made no changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After its second triennial review, in a letter to EPA dated June 23, 1986, the State Board acknowledged that the 1978
Delta Plan standards were not adequate to protect the estuary's fishery resources. It then outlined the hearing process
it was planning for revising the standards. In response, and as part of its consideration of the State Board's second
triennial review, EPA, on June 29, 1987, sent a letter to the State Board stating that EPA could no longer approve the
striped bass survival standards (or the related provision allowing relaxation of the spawning standard in drier
years) because these standards did not adequately protect the designated uses. EPA recognized, however, that the
State Board had initiated new hearings to revise the 1978 Delta Plan standards. EPA therefore indicated that it would
await the results of the new hearings and approve or disapprove the revised standards after the State Board's submission
to EPA of a complete set of revised standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to EPA's review under the CWA, the 1978 Delta Plan also received intense scrutiny under state law in California
state court. This review culminated in a state appellate decision,

182 Cal. App. 2d 82 (1st Dist., 1986) (known as the ``Racanelli Decision'' after its author, Judge John T. Racanelli).
Among that decision's many holdings was the conclusion that the 1978 Delta Plan's water quality standards had been
impermissibly limited to those standards that could be enforced against only the SWP and CVP (instead of against all
water users). The court took notice that the State Board had proposed hearings to develop revisions to the 1978 Delta
Plan, and asked the State Board to remedy the Plan's shortcomings in those hearings.

Following the first phase of the new hearings, the State Board in November 1988 issued a draft Plan that included revised
salinity and flow standards to protect the fisheries and other designated uses. The State Board subsequently withdrew
that draft Plan, however, and issued a revised workplan that served as the basis for the State Board's present Water
Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (1991 Bay/Delta
Plan). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the revised workplan, the State Board, on May 1, 1991, adopted State Board Resolution No. 91&hyph;34,
formally approving the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. The Plan restated the specific designated uses that had been included
in the 1978 Delta Plan and related regional board basin plans. As restated, the designated uses included the following:
Agricultural Supply, Cold and Warm Fresh-Water Habitat, Estuarine Habitat, Fish Migration, Fish Spawning, Groundwater
Recharge, Industrial Process Supply, Industrial Service Supply, Municipal and Domestic Supply, Navigation, Contact
and Non-Contact Water Recreation, Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species,
Shellfish Harvesting, and Wildlife Habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan, which was submitted for EPA's review on May 29, 1991, amended certain salinity criteria and
adopted new temperature and dissolved oxygen criteria for specified locations in the estuary. The changes to the
criteria, however, were of minimal substance. The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan did not revise the earlier 1978 Delta Plan to
address EPA's longstanding concerns about adequate protection for the designated fish and wildlife uses of the Bay/Delta.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 3, 1991, EPA approved in part and disapproved in part the provisions of the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. EPA's
letter found that ``[t]he record *&blank;*&blank;* does not support the conclusion that the State has adopted criteria
sufficient to protect the designated uses'' of the estuary. The designated uses at risk, as defined by the State Board,
include Estuarine Habitat, and also Cold and Warm Water Habitat, Fish Migration, Fish Spawning, Ocean Commercial
and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species, Shellfish Harvesting, and Wildlife Habitat. In
addition to its general finding that the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan did not contain sufficient criteria to protect the designated
uses, EPA also disapproved the absence of salinity standards to protect fish and wildlife uses in the Suisun, San Pablo,
and San Francisco Bays and Suisun Marsh, the absence of scientifically supportable salinity standards (measured
by electrical conductivity) to protect the Fish Spawning uses of the lower San Joaquin River, and the absence of scientifically
supportable temperature standards on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers to protect the fall-run and winter-run
chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 303(c)(3) of the Act, the State Board had 90 days to make changes to the criteria disapproved by
EPA in its September 3, 1991 letter. The State Board made no such revisions during the 90 day period or at any subsequent
time. However, in the summer of 1992, the State Board, at the request of the Governor of the State of California, held
hearings for the purpose of establishing interim measures to protect the natural resources in the Bay/Delta estuary.
In keeping with the CWA's recognition that the states have primary responsibility for setting water quality standards,
EPA participated in these hearings_rather than proposing federal standards at that time_in the hope that the hearings
would result in state adoption of approvable standards and preclude the need for a federal rulemaking. EPA submitted
opening and closing statements to the State Board, and joined with NMFS and USFWS in submitting an Interagency Statement
of Principles. These statements recommended that the State Board adopt a habitat and ecosystem-based approach to
standards that would satisfy CWA requirements and meet the State Board's goal of reversing the decline of the estuary's
fish and wildlife resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conclusion of these hearings, the State Board, on December 10, 1992, issued its recommended interim measures
in Draft Water Rights Decision (hereinafter D&hyph;1630). The Draft contained new water export limits and pumping
restrictions and ordered ``pulse flows'' to help transport young migratory fish through the Delta. It also imposed
water conservation measures on agricultural and urban users, and established a restoration fund financed by user
fees to pay for conservation efforts in the Bay/Delta. Although D&hyph;1630 proposed several changes in the operation
of the water facilities affecting the estuary that would be beneficial to its natural resources, EPA informed the
State Board in its comments dated January 13, 1993, that D&hyph;1630, if adopted, would not satisfy the requirements
of the Act. EPA noted that D&hyph;1630, a proposed water rights decision, did not purport to revise the State's water
quality standards at all, and therefore did not affect EPA's prior decision disapproving the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan.
Moreover, EPA noted that the measures in D&hyph;1630 were not tied to specific designated uses in the estuary (including
the Estuarine Habitat, Fish Spawning, and Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species uses), and that no attempt
had been made to assure that the designated uses would be protected. Accordingly, EPA found that D&hyph;1630 ``meets
neither the procedural nor the substantive requirements of the Clean Water Act.'' After the close of the comment period
for D&hyph;1630, the State Board, in response to a subsequent request by the Governor, declined to adopt D&hyph;1630.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the State Board's failure to revise the criteria disapproved in EPA's September 3, 1991 letter, EPA,
pursuant to section 303 (c)(3) and (c)(4) of the Act, is proposing regulations establishing revised water quality
criteria which would in effect supersede and supplement the disapproved State criteria for purposes of the CWA.

B. Statutory Basis and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 303(c) of the Act requires that state water quality standards ``*&blank;*&blank;* be such as to protect the
public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of this Act. Such standards shall be established
taking into consideration their use and value for propagation of fish and wildlife. *&blank;*&blank;*'' Key concerns
of this statutory provision are the enhancement of water quality and the protection of the propagation of fish. The
ultimate purpose of water quality standards, as with the other sections of the Act, is to restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. CWA section 101(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 303(c) of the Act, a water quality standard for a specific waterbody consists of two components: a designated
use for which a waterbody is to be protected (such as recreation, fish and wildlife, or agriculture) and a numerical
or qualitative water quality criterion which supports the designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act gives primary responsibility for the adoption of water quality standards to the states. After adopting its
initial water quality standards, a state is required, no less than every three years, to review those standards and,
if necessary, modify them. Under section 303(c)(1) of the Act, the results of these triennial reviews are to be submitted
to EPA for review and approval or disapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Water Quality Standards regulations at 40 CFR part 131 specify the requirements for water quality criteria.
States must adopt those water quality criteria that protect the designated use. Such criteria must be based on sound
scientific rationale and must contain sufficient parameters or constituents to protect the designated use. For
waters with multiple use designations, the criteria shall support the most sensitive use. (see 40 CFR 131.11(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a state's criteria must be consistent with the state's antidegradation policy. The federal regulations
provide that, at a minimum, the state must maintain ``[e]xisting instream water uses [those existing in the waterbody
at any time on or after November 28, 1975] and the level of water quality necessary to protect the existing uses. *&blank;*&blank;*''
40 CFR 131.12(a)(1). In order to approve a state's water quality criteria, EPA must determine whether the state has
adopted ``water quality criteria [that are] sufficient to protect the designated uses.'' 40 CFR 131.6(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 303(c)(4) of the Act provides that the Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations
establishing a new or revised standard in either of two situations: First, when the Administrator has disapproved
a state standard under section 303(c)(3) and the state has not taken corrective action within 90 days; and, second,
in any case where the Administrator determines that a revised or new standard is necessary to meet the requirements
of the Act. Once promulgated, the federal regulations are applicable to the state's waters, and, if they are more stringent,
have the effect of supplanting and supplementing the state's standards. However, it is EPA's longstanding policy
that the federal regulations will be withdrawn if a state adopts and submits standards that in the Agency's judgment
meet the requirements of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing California's implementation of its water quality standards program, EPA has considered the provisions
of section 101(g) of the Act, which restate the long-standing policy of Federal deference to state water allocation
functions: ``It is the policy of Congress that the authority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its
jurisdiction shall not be superseded, abrogated or otherwise impaired by this [Act].'' The General Counsel of EPA,
in a Memorandum to Regional Administrators dated November 7, 1978, interpreted this statutory provision in the context
of the water quality standards program and concluded that ``EPA should therefore impose requirements which affect
water usage only where they are clearly necessary to meet the Act's requirements.'' See also Memorandum from Robert
M. Perry, General Counsel, to Frederic A. Eidsness, Jr., Assistant Administrator for Water, dated March 17, 1983
(considering interplay of section 101(g) and the guidelines under section 404(b)(1) of the Act). These positions
of the General Counsel are consistent with the existing judicial precedent interpreting section 101(g). The leading
case interpreting section 101(g) in light of the other mandates of the CWA,

As the discussion above indicates, EPA has attempted to accommodate the State Board processes procedurally, generally
deferring to the State Board schedules for review and revision of its water quality standards, even though this State
process has continued for almost a decade and has frequently exceeded the Act's required triennial review requirements.
Similarly, EPA is in this proposal attempting to accommodate the State's interest substantively. Although the State
Board, in the 1978 Delta Plan, adopted explicit flow criteria, EPA is refraining from proposing direct revisions
to the flow criteria. Instead, EPA is proposing criteria that describe the habitat conditions necessary to protect
the designated uses of the Bay/Delta. The State Board still has full discretion to develop implementation measures
attaining those habitat conditions, and still retains full discretion over the allocation of water necessary to
achieve the criteria. Finally, EPA has fully considered the record developed in the State Board's 1992 hearings on
D&hyph;1630 and, to the extent possible, has incorporated the scientific information presented in those hearings
in the proposed criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Board's adoption of the 1978 Delta Plan, and of the revised Bay/Delta Plan in 1991, were intended to meet the
State's obligations to establish water quality standards under the CWA. Pursuant to its mandate under section 303(c)(3)
of the Act, on September 3, 1991, EPA disapproved several of the criteria contained in the State Board's plan. For the
reasons outlined herein and in EPA's letter of September 3, 1991, the Administrator finds that the water quality criteria
adopted by the State fail to protect the designated uses and the criteria proposed below would meet the requirements
of the Act. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 303(c)(3) and 303(c)(4) of the Act, the Administrator is proposing
the following water quality criteria applicable to California waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Proposed Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing three different sets of water quality criteria: Salinity criteria protecting estuarine habitat
in the Suisun Bay area, salmon smolt survival indices protecting salmon migration, and an electrical conductivity
criterion protecting striped bass spawning on the lower San Joaquin River. Each set of criteria is intended to protect
a particular designated use or set of uses in the Bay/Delta estuary. As discussed above, these designated uses were
originally established by the regional boards in the individual basin plans and by the State Board in its 1978 Delta
Plan, and were reaffirmed and restated in the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. The discussion below describes each set of proposed
criteria in detail and outlines the scientific basis for the proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these proposed criteria, EPA has considered the scientific evidence and testimony presented during
the State Board's 1992 hearing process, as well as scientific information from other sources. In particular, EPA
has relied upon the recommendations of the USFWS, of Dr. Peter Moyle, Professor in the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries
Biology at the University of California at Davis and author of more than 100 articles and books on the ecology of the
inland fishes of California, and of a distinguished panel of scientists who participated in a series of workshops
sponsored by the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed criteria are consistent with the Interagency Statement of Principles dated June 15, 1992 and submitted
to the State Board by EPA, USFWS, and NMFS during the Board's 1992 hearings. This Interagency Statement recommended
that the State Board develop a comprehensive habitat protection approach to restore and maintain the ecological
health of the estuary, and provided a framework for both interim and long-term standards. The Interagency Statement
also emphasized that there is a consensus among the three federal agencies that the existing scientific information
is sufficient to set criteria to protect the designated uses of the estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria proposed below are similar to those EPA has outlined in letters and statements to State and federal agencies,
including in the following: its September 3, 1991 disapproval letter to the State Board; its June 11, 1992 policy statement
and its August 24, 1992 closing statement submitted to the State Board's 1992 hearings; and its October 29, 1992 letter
to USFWS and NMFS. Throughout this process, EPA has carefully coordinated its actions and proposals with other State
and Federal environmental agencies to achieve a consensus on the water quality criteria necessary to protect the
estuary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan included ``Estuarine Habitat'' as a designated use for the Bay/Delta estuary. As
described more fully in the Water Quality Control Plan, San Francisco Bay Basin [2], December 1986, at II&hyph;4,
this Estuarine Habitat designated use is intended to provide ``an essential and unique habitat that serves to acclimate
anadromous fishes (salmon, striped bass) migrating into fresh or marine conditions. This habitat also provides
for the propagation and sustenance of a variety of fish and shellfish, numerous waterfowl and shore birds, and marine
mammals.'' Related fish and wildlife uses of the Bay/Delta estuary designated by the State Board include Ocean Commercial
and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species, Shellfish Harvesting, Fish Migration, and Wildlife
Habitat. To protect these designated uses, the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan included dissolved oxygen and temperature criteria
to protect chinook salmon, outflow and salinity criteria to protect striped bass, and salinity criteria to protect
the managed (non-tidal) areas of Suisun Marsh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, the specific criteria adopted by the State Board clearly do not protect the integrity of the Estuarine
Habitat designated use. Although EPA had already many times noted the inadequacies of the 1978 Delta Plan, the 1991
Bay/Delta Plan made only minor adjustments to criteria protecting striped bass, salmon, and the managed portions
of the Suisun Marsh, and provided no criteria specifically addressing the Estuarine Habitat designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shortcomings of the State Board's criteria are reflected by the continued deterioration of the estuary's resources.
The SBI, used as a measure of the health of the 1978 Delta Plan's indicator species, has never attained its targeted
value of 79, and instead has plummeted to unprecedented low values. Recent testimony by the California DFG indicates
that virtually all of the estuary's major fish species are in clear decline (CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8).
As noted above in the recitation of the history of the Bay/Delta, many species relying on the estuarine habitat are
listed or are being considered for listing under the ESA. One recent report suggests that at least five of the estuary's
fish species (longfin smelt, spring-run Chinook salmon, Sacramento splittail, green sturgeon, and Red Hills roach)
qualify for immediate listing under the ESA (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992), in addition to the already listed winter-run
Chinook salmon and Delta smelt.

Gov. Wilson also outlined the kinds of measures necessary to protect the Bay/Delta: ``If we are to be good stewards
of our fish and wildlife, we must begin to mitigate these impacts by providing larger streamflows, greater Delta outflow,
restoration of spawning gravel and provision of fish screens and temperature control measures.'' In response to
Gov. Wilson's proposal, the State Board initiated the D&hyph;1630 process, the ``immediate goal'' of which was ``to
halt the decline and increase the protection of public trust resources where reasonable.'' (SWRCB 1992b). However,
as explained above, California abandoned the D&hyph;1630 process, and the State Board has yet to develop criteria
that adequately protect the Estuarine Habitat designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its disapproval letter of September 3, 1991, EPA formally found that the set of water quality criteria adopted by
the State Board in the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan failed to protect the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife
uses of the estuary.

To be consistent with the Clean Water Act and the accompanying Regulations, the State's [criteria] must be sufficient
to protect Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses. The Estuarine Habitat use, which has been
formally approved by the State and EPA as part of the State's water quality standards, was established to provide ``an
essential and unique habitat that serves to acclimate anadromous fishes (salmon, striped bass) migrating into fresh
or marine conditions. This habitat also provides for the propagation and sustenance of a variety of fish and shellfish,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the State Board's failure to address EPA's concerns either directly or in the D&hyph;1630 process, EPA is proposing
to supplement the State's criteria with additional salinity criteria to protect the Estuarine Habitat designated
use and related fish and wildlife uses of the estuary described above. EPA is emphasizing the Estuarine Habitat designated
use because of its importance to the whole spectrum of fish and wildlife uses in the estuary. This emphasis is consistent
with the Interagency Statement of Principles' recommendation that restoration efforts focus on habitat protection.
The discussion below describes the scientific basis for salinity criteria and presents EPA's conclusions as to this
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Developing Salinity Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing proposed criteria protecting Estuarine Habitat, EPA has considered the complex hydrological and
biological nature of the Bay/Delta estuarine system. Habitat conditions in the estuary change from month to month
and year to year primarily in response to precipitation upstream, reservoir operations, agricultural patterns
and export rates (Nichols et al. 1986). Many important environmental characteristics within the Delta and Bay respond
to changes in water availability, storage and use. The environmental characteristics of particular biological
importance include flow rates and volumes within river channels and the Bay, salinity and turbidity levels, water
temperature, and the degree of stratification of the water column. Correlations among all these variables are high;
thus, each is often a good indicator of the other. However, other factors such as wind, tidal stage, and antecedent
conditions influence the day to day values of each variable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When EPA disapproved the State's criteria on September 3, 1991, it suggested that the State could develop approvable
replacement criteria using a number of alternative methodologies: it could adopt additional salinity and temperature
criteria, adopt revised flow criteria, adopt biological criteria, or develop a combination of these or other scientifically-defensible
criteria protecting the designated Estuarine Habitat and fish and wildlife uses in the estuary. Upon the State's
failure to revise its criteria during the statutory 90 day period (or during the D&hyph;1630 process), EPA began developing
a federal proposal for criteria protecting the applicable designated uses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Entrapment Zone
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The ``entrapment zone'' was the focus of EPA's initial consideration of water quality criteria due primarily to
its perceived importance to the food chain. The entrapment zone, where ocean water flowing landward at depth mixes
with freshwater flowing seaward at the surface (Kimmerer 1992), is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important
habitats within the estuary. Salinities are usually between 2 and 10 ppt, turbidity and phytoplankton densities
are high, and young fish of several species are most abundant in this zone. One of the most important aspects of the entrapment
zone is the localized high density of prey. The closest association of predator and prey with the entrapment zone is
shown by Delta smelt and its principal food item, the copepod 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eurytemora affinis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Moyle et al. 1992). Similarly, young striped bass and their principal food item, the shrimp 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neomysis affinis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, are found in the greatest abundance in salinities between 2 and 10 ppt. (Heubach 1969, Siegfried et al. 1979, Orsi
and Knutson 1979, Knutson and Orsi 1983, Orsi and Mecum 1986, Obrebski, et al. 1992). Many young fish require high food
densities in order to obtain sufficient food for growth (Moyle and Cech 1988), and it has been suggested that the density
of food in the entrapment zone may affect fish survival and abundance. However, no direct evidence of starvation has
been demonstrated for the declining fish populations of the estuary (Bennett et al. 1990, Moyle et al. 1992). The location
of the entrapment zone has also been shown to be important for organisms at lower trophic levels (that is, organisms
that are lower on the food chain). Phytoplankton densities are higher when the entrapment zone is within the relatively-shallow
Suisun Bay than when it is further upstream in deeper channels (Arthur and Ball 1980). Measurements of phytoplankton
growth rates show that shallow areas are ten times as productive as channel areas (Cloern et al. 1983).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In large part because of the relationship between fishery productivity and the entrapment zone described above,
EPA initially considered developing federal criteria designed to directly maintain and protect the entrapment
zone. However, as described below, discussions among the participants in a workshop convened by the SFEP suggested
that salinity criteria would be a more appropriate measure for protecting estuarine habitat.

San Francisco Estuary Project Workshop Findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SFEP is a five-year cooperative effort by over 100 representatives of public and private entities concerned about
the water quality and natural resources of the San Francisco Bay estuary. Funded primarily by EPA and the State of California,
the SFEP has developed a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan to protect the natural and consumptive water
uses of the Bay/Delta (SFEP 1993a). In 1991 and 1992, the SFEP convened a series of workshops to develop the scientific
rationale for an estuarine index that would measure the responses of estuarine biota and habitats to various conditions
of salinity and flow. The workshops involved approximately thirty scientists and policy makers with expertise in
estuarine ecology and water resource management, and included several of the world's most distinguished estuarine
scientists. The group focused its attention on the estuary between Carquinez Strait and the confluence of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers. The specific operations of the water projects (water exports, gate closures, etc.) were not
directly addressed by the group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The findings of the workshops were assembled in a final report, Managing Freshwater Discharge to the San Francisco
Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary: The Scientific Basis for an Estuarine Standard (SFEP 1993b) (SFEP Report).
All of the conclusions and recommendations in this report were endorsed by a consensus of the estuarine scientists
and managers who participated in the final workshop in August of 1992.

The SFEP Report defined ``consensus'' as follows: ``The term consensus is used to represent group solidarity on an
issue; a judgement arrived at by most of the scientists and managers present. In all cases, the consensus was unanimous
or nearly unanimous.'' SFEP Report, at p. 3. EPA recognizes that representatives from a number of the participating
organizations (the State Water Contractors, the California Department of Water Resources (California DWR), the
State Board, and the USBR) subsequently withdrew their names from the final SFEP Report. According to the Final Report,
the conclusions are based on the consensus that was achieved by the participants at the workshops.

Although the workshop group initially focused on the entrapment zone, they concluded that salinity would be a more
appropriate index for the development of estuarine standards. Salinity was selected for several reasons: It is of
direct ecological importance, it can be measured accurately and easily, and it integrates a number of important estuarine
properties and processes. In particular, it is closely associated with the abundance and distribution of species
at all trophic levels (SFEP 1993b). The workgroup further concluded that the placement of the 2 parts per thousand
isohaline
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 should be used to develop estuarine standards.

An ``isohaline'' is defined as a theoretical or imaginary line in the estuary connecting all points of equal salinity.
For example, the phrase ``2

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
near-bottom isohaline'' means a line stretching across the Delta marking the positions where the salinity of the
near-bottom water is 2 parts per thousand. The position of an isohaline in an estuary changes dramatically during
the day because of rising and falling tides, which sometimes move the isohaline as much as 5 miles up or downstream during
a 24 hour period. By convention, a daily isohaline is measured at its daily mean position for the 24 hour period.

and processes, and that is meaningful to a large number of constituencies.

Because the difference between surface and near-bottom salinities is small and because the relationship between
them is reasonably well known, surface salinity could also be used. Near-bottom salinity is recommended, however,
because it is a more stable indicator. [Footnote in the original.]

In developing these conclusions, the workshop participants relied in part on a series of papers developed by Dr. Alan
Jassby of the University of California at Davis and Dr. Wim Kimmerer of BioSystems Analysis, Inc. These papers concluded
that the position of the 2 ppt isohaline is closely associated with the abundance of estuarine organisms at all trophic
levels, as well as with the supply of organic matter from phytoplankton production and riverine loading (phytoplankton
POC). The estuarine organisms include primary and secondary zooplankton consumers (

), a major group of benthic consumers in Suisun Bay (mollusks), bottom-foraging fish (starry flounder), and both
survival (striped bass) and abundance (striped bass and longfin smelt) of fish that feed in the water column. For each
of these organisms, with the exception of mollusks, abundance levels increase as the position of the 2 ppt isohaline
is located farther downstream (Jassby 1993).

The SFEP's final report cautioned that these correlations are not proof of cause and effect relationships. That is,
the report did not attempt to identify the causal mechanism linking the salinity regime and the abundance of estuarine
organisms. Further, the report did not address other factors unrelated to water quality, such as overfishing, that
may also have an impact on abundance of certain aquatic resources. Nevertheless, salinity integrates a number of
important estuarine properties, is easy to measure, and is readily understood by all interested parties. The particular
value of 2 ppt near-bottom salinity was selected because it occurs near the upstream limit of marine salt penetration,
is higher than salinities derived from agricultural runoff, is close to the entrapment zone and is associated with
little stratification of the water column. The group concluded that the location of the 2 ppt isohaline, measured
as kilometers upstream from the Golden Gate Bridge, is the most appropriate index of habitat conditions underlying
the variability in biological resources (SFEP 1993b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These findings in the SFEP workshop reports are entirely consistent with other scientific work in the Bay/Delta.
For example, Dr. Peter Moyle testified to the State Board that nursery habitat (represented by areas of low salinity)
in Suisun Bay is now more important than it was historically due to the high risks of entrainment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 faced by fishes in the Delta. After discussing a variety of mechanisms that may be behind the declines of most aquatic
populations of the upper estuary, Dr. Moyle concluded that ``[w]hile the exact mechanisms that account for the importance
of having the [entrapment] zone in Suisun Bay (increased food supplies, physical concentration of organisms, association
with higher flows, etc.) are being debated, there seems little doubt that many fish species depend on this location
for their long-term survival'' (Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9). Dr. Moyle recommended that in wetter years
the zone of low salinity habitat should be located near Roe Island but that in drier years this requirement could be
shifted upstream to Chipps Island. In addition, the USFWS cited the importance of low-salinity habitat in Suisun
Bay in the January to June period in its 1991 proposal to designate critical habitat for Delta smelt under the ESA. 56
FR 50075 (October 3, 1991).

Strictly defined, ``entrainment'' is the displacement of fish or other aquatic organisms from their location in
one waterbody to another as a result of the operation of a water diversion. In the Bay/Delta, however, the term ``entrainment''
is generally used to refer to the destruction of fish or larvae at the intake mechanisms of the many water diversion
facilities in the Delta. Most entrainment occurs when fish or larvae are pulled into screens or pumps by the diversion
apparatus.

c. Ecological Significance of Salinity Levels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is selecting the 2 ppt isohaline as the basis for its proposed criteria in part because that isohaline incorporates
a whole range of factors relevant to the estuary's health, even though the operation of some of these factors is not
fully understood. Some species that show high correlations with the location of the 2 ppt isohaline are not abundant
in low salinity habitat and are probably responding to river flow or other correlated factors. However, salinity
in the 2 ppt range is clearly and directly important to a broad range of estuarine species and the location of this salinity
is strongly associated with the abundance and distribution of many of these species. The SFEP Report emphasized that
it is well established scientifically that salinity has direct ecological importance to many estuarine species
in this estuary and others throughout the world (SFEP 1993b). In fact, much of the distribution of estuarine species
can be explained by their association with specific salinity ranges and their ability to survive and reproduce within
certain salinity limits. The following sections summarize the best available evidence on the direct effects of the
location of low salinity habitat on the distribution and abundance of key species and habitats within the Bay/Delta
estuary. This scientific evidence provides substantial support for the need for the proposed salinity criteria
protecting the water quality necessary to sustain the ecological health of the estuary.

_Delta smelt. Delta smelt (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hypomesus transpacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are found today only in the upper reaches of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary. Early studies by the California
DFG of the two most abundant smelts, longfin smelt and Delta smelt, noted that changes in the historical location of
the entrapment zone would threaten populations of both species (Broadway 1979). In its initial notice of petition
findings for the listing of the Delta smelt as threatened under the ESA, the USFWS found that ``the annual export of
6 million acre-feet of water by Federal, State and private agencies has allowed the intrusion of higher salinity seawater
to the marshes. Because of higher salinities, the Delta smelt has lost spawning and nursery areas in Suisun Bay and
Suisun Marsh.'' 55 FR 52852, 52853 (December 24, 1990). The final rule listing Delta smelt as a threatened species
found that embryonic, larval and post-larval mortality rates increase as salinities in the western Delta increase
and the entrapment zone moves upstream. Delta smelt larvae survive and grow best when the entrapment zone occupies
a broad geographic area with extensive shallow areas. Delta smelt reproduction has probably suffered in recent years
because the entrapment zone has been located east of Suisun Bay. 58 FR 12854 (March 5, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal to list the Delta smelt as a threatened species, the USFWS identified critical habitat for the species
as requiring salinities less than 2 ppt in Suisun Bay from January through June. 56 FR 50075, 50079 (October 3, 1991).
When listing the Delta smelt as threatened, the USFWS deferred designation of critical habitat until October 1993.
In summarizing the factors affecting Delta smelt, the USFWS concluded that the biological characteristics of the
species made it very sensitive to perturbations in its reproductive habitat and larval nursery grounds. The final
listing notice further determined that Suisun Bay is the primary nursery habitat for this species and that the habitat
has been degraded because of higher salinities in the spring due to upstream freshwater diversions. 58 FR 12854, 12860
(March 5, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USFWS's conclusions were also supported by an interagency Delta smelt working group convened by the USFWS after
its proposal to list the species under the ESA. The working group included representatives of USFWS, EPA, USBR, California
DFG, and the California DWR. The working group developed several recommendations to increase abundance levels of
Delta smelt, including maintaining the 2 ppt zone in Suisun Bay during the Delta smelt's early months of life. The working
group's recommendation was that low salinity habitat be kept in Suisun Bay in all years; no attempt was made to adjust
the position of the zone to account for dry year conditions (USFWS 1992f, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USFWS's proposed critical habitat designation has been supported by a recently published paper by biologists
of the California DFG and the University of California at Davis. The authors concluded that Delta smelt are most abundant
in low salinity water associated with the entrapment zone. During the years preceding their decline, Delta smelt
were found most abundantly at sites where low salinity conditions coincided with shallow habitats. Since their decline,
low salinity conditions have been found in areas where little shallow habitat is available. The principal conclusion
of these authors was that ``[r]estoration of the Delta smelt to a sustainable population size is likely to require
maintenance of the [entrapment] zone in Suisun Bay and maintenance of net seaward flows in the lower San Joaquin River
during the period when larvae are present'' (Moyle et al. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Board's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan also acknowledged that the location of the 2 ppt isohaline is important for Delta
smelt, finding that ``existing knowledge suggests that salinities of 2 ppt or less are desired in Suisun Bay from March
through June.'' However, rather than adopting protective salinity criteria, the State Board suggested that protection
of low-salinity habitat would be dealt with as a ``flow'' issue in the subsequent scoping and water rights phases of
its proceedings (1991 Bay/Delta Plan, p. 5&hyph;44). As explained in more detail above, to date the State Board has
failed to adopt any additional standards since its 1991 Bay/Delta Plan.

_Striped Bass. Striped bass (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Morone saxatilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) support one of the most economically important sportfisheries in the Bay/Delta estuary. The striped bass population
(and consequently the number of anglers) has plummeted since the early 1970's, with populations declining by as much
as 70 percent from historical levels (Stevens et al. 1985; White 1986; CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8). Although
striped bass populations exist elsewhere in entirely freshwater habitats, the species thrives only in estuarine
conditions (Talbot 1966), and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary low salinity habitat appears to provide important
nursery grounds (Wang 1986). Adult striped bass migrate upstream to spawn in fresh water. The planktonic larvae are
carried downstream and concentrate in areas of low salinity (Moyle 1976). When this low salinity zone is located in
Suisun Bay, survival of young bass is improved (Turner and Chadwick 1972). As a result, several parties have recommended
that the entrapment zone be maintained in Suisun Bay to improve striped bass year class survival (Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9;
USBR 1991, WRINT&hyph;USBR&hyph;2; USFWS 1992d, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;19; USFWS 1992e, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;20;
Moyle and Herbold 1989; Moyle, et al. 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other factors, including year-to-year variations in outflow and exports, have also contributed to the decline of
the striped bass population. California DFG has developed a model suggesting that export limitations also are necessary
to preserve the striped bass fishery. Accordingly, California DFG's recent recommendations to protect striped
bass have focused on reducing entrainment of fish, eggs and larvae in water pumps operated by the SWP and the CVP, rather
than on maintaining protective salinity conditions (CDFG 1992e, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;3; D&hyph;1630). However,
according to a series of papers developed for the SFEP-sponsored workshops, models that are based on the downstream
extent of low salinity habitat are at least as accurate in predicting striped bass abundance as the California DFG
model based on flows and exports (Jassby, in SFEP 1993b; CDFG 1992e, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;3). The studies cited above
suggest that, regardless of the effects of entrainment at the diversion pumps, low salinity nursery habitat in Suisun
Bay is important and that this habitat has sharply declined in recent years. Based on these studies, EPA believes that
salinity criteria in Suisun Bay are necessary to protect nursery habitat of the striped bass.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are now restricted to the lower reaches of the rivers flowing into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the upper
regions of the San Francisco Bay complex, particularly Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh (Moyle 1976; Moyle 1980). Historically,
this species occurred throughout the lowlands of the Sacramento Valley, but diking and dredging have eliminated
96% of the wetland habitats this species appears to require (Meiorin et al. 1991). Currently, the population lives
largely in the shallow, low salinity habitat of Suisun Bay and Marsh but in early spring adults migrate upstream through
the Delta to spawn near the mouths of the rivers along the Delta's eastern edge (Daniels and Moyle 1983). Although this
migration pattern predominates for most of the splittail, lower concentrations of the species can be found in most
locations in the Delta throughout the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, fewer numbers of newly-spawned splittail have moved across the Delta, back to Suisun Bay. Recent
severe declines in regions in which splittail were formerly abundant resulted in the filing of petitions to list the
species as endangered under the ESA. 50 FR 36184 (July 6, 1993). The only other member of the genus, found in Clear Lake,
California, became extinct in the early 1970's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No physiological studies have been done to determine the specific salinity tolerances of the splittail, but it is
likely that high salinities restrict their downstream range. The scarcity of shallow habitats upstream and the increase
of salinity in Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh have greatly restricted the habitat required by this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail recruitment displays a strong relationship to annual outflow (Daniels and Moyle 1983). The
exact mechanism that results in this relationship is unclear; years of higher outflow provide better cues to direct
successful migration upstream by adults, larger areas of flooded vegetation on which the adults can spawn (Caywood
1974), higher flows to transport the newly spawned young downstream, and larger areas of suitable habitat in Suisun
Bay and Suisun Marsh. Protection of historical habitat conditions in the Bay/Delta through the implementation of
the proposed salinity criteria should therefore provide indirect protection for all the needs of this species that
depend on outflow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

_Estuary dependent species. In addition to Delta smelt and striped bass, several other fish species are dependent
on brackish-water nursery habitat. The juveniles of these species, collectively referred to as ``estuary dependent
species'' by the California DFG, live predominantly downstream of the Delta within a salinity range of approximately
0 to 22 ppt, although the range varies somewhat by species. This habitat is larger than the nursery habitat for Delta
smelt and striped bass, but nevertheless has substantially diminished in size as water has been diverted and stored
for upstream uses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), depend on brackish-water nursery habitat for a significant portion of their life cycles. Bay shrimp and starry
flounder are important components of commercial and sport fisheries, and their protection is important to maintain
the State's Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing designated uses, as well as the Estuarine Habitat designated use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bay shrimp is the largest shrimp species in the estuary, and has been the most numerous, except during recent prolonged
drought conditions, when abundance has been very low. It supports a commercial bait fishery in the Bay, and is an important
food source for the larger fish of the estuary. Reproductive adults and larvae are found in the more marine habitats
of Central San Francisco Bay and nearshore Gulf of the Farallones. Transforming larvae and early juveniles move into
the Bay from the nearshore ocean, and maturing juveniles are mainly found in warm, shallow, brackish water areas (2
to 22 ppt) of the estuary (CDFG 1992; WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starry flounder also use the brackish areas of San Francisco Bay as nursery habitat. After moving into the Bay as transforming
larvae from the nearshore ocean during the spring, young-of-the-year juvenile flounder (smaller than 70 mm) are
found primarily in warm shallows where salinities are less than 22 ppt (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). By the
second year of life (1+), the fish have moved out of fresh water completely and are concentrated in the brackish water
areas of the Bay. By the third year of life (2+) they have spread throughout the higher salinity areas, and many have
migrated out of the Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starry flounder supports both a commercial and recreational fishery in the San Francisco Bay area. Commercial catch
has varied between 486 thousand pounds in 1980 to a minimum of 40 thousand pounds in 1990. Although starry flounder
are a small component of the flatfish catch (2 percent by weight), they are second only to California halibut in price
per pound at the dock (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). Commercial passenger fishery total catch and catch per
unit effort in San Pablo Bay have declined dramatically since the mid-1970's. Abundance of starry flounder young-of-the-year
and one-year-olds (1+) has been consistently low since 1986, and older starry flounder (two years old and older) have
also declined in the Bay since the mid-1970's, based on Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel logs (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until recently, longfin smelt has been one of the most abundant fish species in the estuary. This species spawns in
freshwater, and larvae and juveniles smaller than 50 mm are predominantly found in brackish water with bottom salinities
less than 18 ppt. According to California DFG, water with less than 18 ppt salinity in the spring months of March through
June constitutes important nursery habitat for longfin smelt (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). Recent populations
of longfin smelt have been very low, and in 1991 the population reached the lowest number ever recorded since monitoring
was initiated in 1967. As a result, this species has been the subject of a petition for listing under the ESA. See Petition
for Listing Under the Endangered Species Act_Longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail, National Heritage Institute
(November 5, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are close correlations between the location of the near-bottom 2 ppt isohaline during winter/spring and annual
abundance indices of bay shrimp, starry flounder, and longfin smelt (Jassby 1992). Annual abundances are low when
the position of the near-bottom 2 ppt isohaline is upstream and does not move to and remain at a position near Roe Island
for any extended period of time. Under these circumstances, the brackish-water nursery habitat favored by these
species is primarily limited to Suisun Bay. Salinity data from California DFG studies indicate that when near-bottom
salinities are at or below 2 ppt near Roe Island in Suisun Bay, salinities downstream over the large shallow flats of
San Pablo Bay are characteristically less than 18 to 22 ppt (CDFG 1993). In years when the position of the near-bottom
2 ppt isohaline moves downstream at least as far as Roe Island in the spring, the area of low-salinity habitat expands
into the large shallows of San Pablo Bay and these species are more abundant. These areas of San Pablo Bay provide greatly
increased habitat within the salinity ranges preferred by juveniles of these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with striped bass, other factors are also likely to contribute to year-to-year variations in abundance of these
species, including the strength of net landward bottom currents (shrimp and flounder), coastal distribution of
reproductive adults and larvae (shrimp and flounder), and successful downstream transport and dispersal of larvae
and juveniles (smelt) (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). However, brackish-water nursery habitat is essential
to the juveniles of these three species, and is a major factor in the strong correlation between the position of the
near-bottom 2 ppt isohaline and abundance. According to studies by California DFG, an index of brackish water habitat
is strongly correlated with abundance indices for these three species (CDFG 1992, figs 1&hyph;3, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6).
EPA's proposed salinity criteria, by providing estuarine habitat conditions similar to the healthier reference
period of the late 1960's to early 1970's, should restore and maintain the brackish-water nursery habitat required
by these three species.

_Suisun Bay Tidal Wetland Species. The tidal wetlands bordering Suisun Bay are characterized as brackish marsh because
of their unique combination of species typical of both freshwater wetlands and more saline wetlands.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Suisun Marsh itself, bordering Suisun Bay on the north, is the largest contiguous brackish water marsh in the United
States. A large portion of the wetland habitat (approximately 44,000 acres) in this marsh is currently diked and managed
for waterfowl use and hunting. Approximately 10,000 acres bordering Suisun Bay are still fully tidal (Meiorin 1991).

There are currently no salinity criteria protecting the Estuarine Habitat, Wildlife Habitat, and other fish and
wildlife uses of the brackish tidal marshes of Suisun Bay. These large tidal marshes are distinct from the ``managed''
marshes in the Suisun Bay. EPA's approval of the 1978 Delta Plan criteria was explicitly conditioned on the State Board's
commitment to develop additional criteria for the tidal marshes and to protect aquatic life in the Suisun Marsh channels
and open waters. Because these conditions have not been met, EPA, in its September 3, 1991 letter on the 1991 Bay/Delta
Plan, disapproved the standards for Suisun Marsh and stated that the State Board should immediately develop salinity
objectives sufficient to protect aquatic life and the brackish tidal wetlands surrounding Suisun Marsh.

These tidal marshes provide habitat for a large, highly diverse, and increasingly rare ecological community. The
recent ``Status and Trends'' reports published by the SFEP listed 154 wildlife species associated with the brackish
marshes surrounding Suisun Bay (Harvey, et al. 1992), including a number of candidates for listing under the ESA.
These include the Suisun song sparrow (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cordylanthus mollis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These rare species are all found exclusively in tidally inundated marsh.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the SFEP-sponsored workshops, a comprehensive literature review and intensive field surveys of marsh
vegetation were undertaken to document the responses of estuarine marsh communities to changes in the salinity regime
(Collins and Foin 1993). The study concluded that salinity levels in the tidal marshes play a major role in the distribution
and abundance of plant species. In addition, average tidal marsh salinity levels are related to the position of the
2 ppt isohaline, although local controls on salinity are important in some areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study also found that recent increases in salinity caused by a combination of upstream diversions and drought
have adversely affected the tidal marsh communities. As salinity has intruded, brackish marsh plants which depend
on soils low in salt content (especially the tules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scirpus californicus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. acutus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have died back in both the shoreline marshes and in some interior marsh channel margins of the western half of Suisun
Bay. These plants have been replaced by plants typically growing in saline soils, especially cordgrass (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spartina foliosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This has been associated with erosion of the marsh margins, significantly reducing the tidal marsh acreage in some
areas. In addition, tules in the upper intertidal zone have been replaced by the smaller and more salt tolerant alkali
bulrush (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scirpus robustus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These changes have significantly affected available habitat for a variety of wildlife that nest and feed in these
areas, including the Suisun song sparrow, marsh wren, common yellowthroat, black-crowned night heron, and snowy
egret (Collins and Foin 1993; Granholm 1987a; 1987b). The loss of habitat for the Suisun song sparrow is of particular
concern, since individuals of this species are found only in the already fragmented marshes bordering Suisun Bay,
occupy an established territory for their lifetime, and depend on tall tules for successful reproduction and cover
from predators (Marshall 1948).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there have been no studies of the direct effects of salinity on rarer plant species, these species are likely
to have the same salinity requirements as non-rare species residing in the same plant communities. Delta tule pea
and Suisun aster are associated with tules along the banks of tidal sloughs (CDFG 1991). Mason's lilaeopsis is also
found along tidal banks, associated with the more freshwater marsh species, including tules, and in the shade of riparian
shrubs such as willows (CDFG 1991). Suisun thistle and soft-haired bird's beak are found in the few remaining higher
elevation tidal marshes. All of these species are limited to marsh areas seasonally inundated with fresh to brackish
water, and depend on such conditions to varying degrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those brackish marsh plants depending on freshwater conditions, the most critical growth period is February
through June. If suitable lowlands were present upstream, increases in the estuary's salinity gradient would allow
brackish tidal marsh communities to migrate upstream. However, the floodplains and other lowlands suitable for
the evolution of tidal marshes are absent upstream of Suisun Bay (SFEP 1993b). As a result, increases in tidal water
salinity may significantly reduce the already severely limited freshwater and brackish marsh habitats, and will
threaten the natural diversity of the estuary's wetland communities. Maintaining historical levels of low-salinity
habitat in Suisun Marsh is therefore essential to protect Estuarine Habitat, Wildlife Habitat, Rare and Endangered
Species, and other uses designated for protection by the State's water quality standards.

Preliminary considerations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section discusses three issues that affect EPA's proposal: the proper level of protection for designated uses,
the basis for choosing the locations for measuring the proposed criteria, and the proper time period for maintaining
the proposed criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Level of Protection. One of the key recommendations of the SFEP-sponsored workshops was that environmental goals
for the estuary would be most effective if expressed in terms of restoring conditions to those that existed at specific
historical periods. If a certain level of ecosystem restoration is selected as a goal, then the relationship between
abundance and the location of the 2 ppt isohaline (and the amount of water necessary to achieve that isohaline) can
be used as a basis for setting standards that will achieve those goals. (SFEP 1993b).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This historically-based approach is consistent with EPA's National Program Guidance for Biological Criteria for
Surface Waters (USEPA 1990). EPA's National Program Guidance recommends that aquatic communities in waterbodies
subject to anthropogenic disturbance be assessed in comparison to similar, but unimpaired waterbodies (a reference
condition). Although the Guidance discusses designation of a reference site to compare directly with an impaired
waterbody, analysis of historical records is also recommended. In the case of the Bay/Delta, a reference waterbody
is not available. Instead, reference conditions have been based on historical information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed salinity criteria reflect estuarine habitat conditions that existed prior to 1976. In the recent State
Board hearings, EPA, NMFS, and USWFS recommended standards that would restore habitat conditions to levels that
existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's (USFWS 1992g, WRINT&hyph;FWS&hyph;10).
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 This period generally reflects conditions that occurred in the estuary before fish habitat and populations began
to experience the most recent significant declines, and therefore serves as a useful definition of a healthy fishery
resource. Land use patterns and upstream water developments had largely stabilized by the end of this period so that
increases in project impacts are the dominant change associated with the subsequent decline in fishery resources.
The reclamation of wetlands was largely complete by the 1920's, and the largest of the upstream developments, Shasta
Reservoir, was completed in the early 1940's.

This restoration goal is less protective than the ``without project'' goal targeted by the State Board as part of its
water quality standards in 1978. In the 1978 Delta Plan, the State Board adopted standards intended to achieve levels
that would have existed in the absence of the state and Federal water projects, and agreed to revise the standards if
necessary to achieve this goal. This ``without projects'' goal was never formally incorporated into the State's
water quality standards, and its continued validity as a stated goal is in question given the court's decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
State Water Resources Control Board, supra

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
) (reviewing the 1978 Delta Plan and rejecting the ``without projects'' approach). EPA continues to believe that
fully offsetting the impacts of water development should be the goal of long-term planning efforts by the State Board
and other agencies. However, because of the precipitous decline in the biological communities of the estuary in the
last decade, this goal is no longer reasonably attainable in the short term, given the existing physical facilities
and water project operations in the Delta. As a result, EPA, USFWS and NMFS have recommended that the State Board immediately
set standards sufficient to restore estuarine habitat conditions to those that existed in the late 1960's and early
1970's, and to establish a long-term goal of fully offsetting the impacts of water development (USFWS 1992g, WRINT&hyph;FWS&hyph;10).
This long-term goal is consistent with the goals of the recently-enacted Central Valley Project Improvement Act
(Title 34 of P.L. 102&hyph;575, 106 Stat. 4600) (Central Valley Project Improvement Act), which include programs
to mitigate the adverse effects incurred as a result of the construction of the CVP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ideally, EPA would use the late 1960's to early 1970's habitat conditions as both the targeted level of protection
and the historical reference period. However, to better reflect the natural variability of wet and dry years, EPA
is proposing criteria that vary according to the ``water year type''. The water year type concept is already fully
integrated into the operations of California water management, and the State Board's classification of years into
one of five categories (wet, above normal, below normal, dry, and critically dry) is accepted as the standard water
year type classification scheme.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period of the late 1960's to early 1970's, however, contained no dry or critically dry years and only one above normal
year. Thus, in order to provide an adequate representation of the different water year types, EPA is proposing the
use of the period 1940 to 1975 as the historic reference period. An examination of the historical record reveals that
this 35 year period was one of fairly consistent hydrological conditions. The period is bracketed by major hydrological
changes_the construction of Shasta Dam immediately before this period, and the extended drought and increased water
exports beginning immediately after this period in 1976.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Including the longer 1940&hyph;1975 period as the historical reference period allows better estimation of the salinity
regime for different water year types than would use of only the late 1960's to early 1970's. Given that the hydrological
conditions were fairly consistent throughout the longer 1940&hyph;1975 period, EPA believes this longer historical
reference period serves as a better long term indicator through all water year types of the habitat conditions existing
in the recommended target years of the late 1960's to early 1970's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of the historical salinity regime is presented in appendix II. Salinity records extend back only
to 1967, whereas daily flow estimates are available from October 1929. Using models created by California DWR relating
flow and salinity allows reconstruction of the salinity regimes in the historical reference period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basis for locations selected. Three locations for the proposed 2 ppt isohaline were selected to correspond to protection
of three different types of estuarine habitat in different water years. Together, the use of these three locations
will maintain the natural variability in salinity levels that characterize the historical data set at medium to lower
flow levels (those substantially within the control of upstream diverters).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Roe Island.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 2 ppt isohaline occurs at or below Roe Island at times of high outflow accompanying storms with uncontrolled runoff,
as well as at times of high water releases from upstream dams. These flows carry many young fish from the Delta downstream
into Suisun Bay. Because the entrapment zone will consistently be near the broad shallows and large marsh areas of
Suisun Bay, the young fish and other organisms associated with the zone will be distributed into these diverse and
productive habitats, greatly increasing the extent and value of their available habitat. This location will also
maximize the inputs of production from Suisun Marsh and the shallows of Suisun Bay into the entrapment zone, and will
provide greatly increased areas of medium to low salinity nursery habitat for estuary dependent species in San Pablo
Bay.

Chipps Island. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The downstream end of Chipps Island marks the upstream end of Suisun Bay. As noted above, low salinity habitat in Suisun
Bay has been well documented as an important nursery area for Delta smelt, striped bass, and other estuarine species.
Suisun Bay also represents the farthest upstream extent of large areas of shallow habitat. These shallow habitats
are more productive than deeper channels (Cloern et al. 1983), and horizontal flows across these shallows bring food
sources into the entrapment zone. For some species, particularly Delta smelt, shallow areas near the entrapment
zone are a preferred habitat (Moyle et al. 1992), perhaps as a refuge from predation. When the average salinity at Chipps
Island is less than 2 ppt, organisms associated with this habitat will be in or near the shallow habitats of Suisun Bay
for half of each tidal cycle.

Confluence of Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers marks the point where organisms associated with low salinity
habitat are exposed to the detrimental conditions in the lower San Joaquin River. The higher mortalities and poorer
habitat conditions associated with the lower San Joaquin River have been documented at length in testimony to the
State Board (USBR 1992, WRINT&hyph;USBR&hyph;2; Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9). This location, then, provides
a suitable upstream limit for the 2 ppt isohaline. When average salinities at the confluence reach the 2 ppt level,
the organisms associated with low salinity habitat will have access to the shallow habitats downstream in Suisun
Bay only during the lower low tide point of the tidal cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Period of protection. Changes in water quality that have affected aquatic resources have been greatest during the
period from February to June. Under naturally-occurring hydrological conditions, flows in these months were often
very large while in summer flow rates declined and salinity in the delta increased. Upstream diversions have altered
this natural pattern by reducing peak spring flows and, in some years, increasing flows during the late summer and
fall months. The changes in summertime water quality (towards lower salinity) occur during a season when most of the
fish species have already completed their spawning or migration (Monroe and Kelly 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The abundance and reproductive success of almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper estuary depend
strongly on conditions during the months from February through June (Stevens 1977; Daniels and Moyle 1983; Stevens
and Miller 1983; Moyle and Herbold 1989; Herbold et al. 1992; SWC 1992, WRINT&hyph;SWC&hyph;1). These species survive
and reproduce more successfully when Suisun Bay has large areas of low salinity habitat (less than 2 ppt), San Pablo
Bay has large areas of medium to low salinities (less than 18 to 22 ppt), river outflows are high, bottom currents are
strong, temperature is low, and the areas of greatest turbidity are downstream of the Delta. Because of the combination
of drought conditions and high levels of water exports, these conditions have occurred very rarely in recent years.
Therefore, EPA's proposed criteria center on these five months.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's specific proposed criteria are shown in Table 1. They include 2 ppt salinity criteria at Roe Island, Chipps Island,
and at the Sacramento/San Joaquin River confluence from February through June. The criteria replicate the average
number of days on which the 2 ppt isohaline occurred at or downstream from each of these locations during the historical
period 1940&hyph;1975, inclusive, classified by water year type. Because no critically dry years occurred in the
period from 1940 to 1975, the required number of days for critically dry years is based on an extrapolation of the data.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed criteria are measured using a 14-day moving average. The use of a 14-day moving average allows the mean
location to be achieved despite the varying strength of tidal currents during the lunar cycle because any 14 day period
will include the full range of spring and neap tidal conditions.

Adjusting the Roe Island standard to reflect intra-year storm variability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the proposed criteria at Roe Island are intended, in part, to replicate low salinity habitat conditions
resulting from spring storm events. Storm events in the spring provide many benefits to aquatic resources of the estuary.
Large areas of flooded vegetation provide ideal spawning for some species, high flows transport many planktonic
larvae downstream, and translocation of low salinity habitat allows wide dispersion of many species which reduces
predation (and perhaps competition) and replenishes otherwise isolated areas. In addition, the variability in
salinity over a wide range is thought to be an important tool in preventing the buildup of molluscan species and, thus,
ensures that more food will accumulate in the entrapment zone (Nichols 1985; Nichols and Pamatmat 1988).

The proposed criteria at Roe Island, unadjusted, would fully protect low salinity habitat, but would not accurately
reflect the historical natural variability in runoff and precipitation. The distribution of storm systems within
the October to April wet season varies greatly year-to-year. In some years, all storm events are concentrated in early
winter, whereas in others the storm events are evenly distributed or concentrated in the spring. This natural historical
variability is reflected in the proposed salinity criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without some form of adjustments, salinity criteria at a fixed downstream location would also result in more flows
through the estuary than might be necessary to maintain water quality (that is, the ``water costs'' would be unnecessarily
high). The flows necessary to hold the 2 ppt isohaline at a particular location in the estuary are substantially less
than the flows needed to move that isohaline downstream to a different position. In the Bay/Delta, these higher flows
used to move the isohaline could come either from natural storm events or from controlled reservoir releases. The
proposed standard provides for an adjustment of the Roe Island standard to more closely replicate natural spring
storm cycles. This adjustment will avoid adverse impacts on species (such as the winter-run salmon) dependent on
upstream reservoir conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the criteria of number of days for a given year type at Roe Island would not apply unless and until
the average daily salinity at Roe Island attains the 2 ppt level through natural uncontrolled flows. Following the
occurrence of such an event, the 14 day average salinity at Roe Island must not exceed 2 ppt for the number of days specified
in Table 1. Therefore, the number of days listed under Roe Island represents the maximum of the number of days that may
be required. In effect, this adjustment provides that the additional water needed to move the isohaline downstream
to Roe Island will come from natural storms rather than from reservoir releases or export restrictions. This approach
better reflects the natural variability in timing and quantity of runoff and significantly reduces the water supply
impacts of the proposed criteria relative to criteria that do not account for this variability.

Under the CWA, the states have a primary role in developing measures implementing water quality criteria. EPA expects
that the State Board would implement these salinity criteria by making appropriate revisions to operational requirements
included in water rights permits issued by the State Board. Consistent with the mandates of section 101(g) of the CWA,
the State Board has full discretion in determining the source of water flows necessary to meet these criteria. EPA
has intentionally drafted its proposed criteria to be measured at or downstream of the confluence of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers. This allows the State Board maximum latitude in choosing a mix of flow conditions and export
restrictions in both river basins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the State Board has full discretion to develop an implementation plan for these criteria in the manner it
chooses, EPA and the other federal agencies involved in water resource management issues in the Bay/Delta (USFWS,
NMFS, and USBR) urge the State Board to spread the burden across as broad a spectrum of water users as possible. The economic
analysis prepared in conjunction with this proposal suggests that spreading the burden results in substantially
lower costs than does imposing the burden on a particular geographical area or a narrowly defined group of water users.
This is not just a matter of fairness. The federal agencies' preliminary discussions with water project managers
indicated that increasing the pool of contributors substantially increases the operational flexibility of the
water system, and thereby reduces the total impact of meeting the proposed criteria. For that reason, the federal
agencies hope the State Board will continue the concept it adopted in its proposal for D&hyph;1630, and will allocate
the burden of meeting these criteria across the broad range of the state's water users.

The State's designated uses for the Bay/Delta include Cold Freshwater Habitat to sustain aquatic resources associated
with a coldwater environment, and Fish Migration to protect those fish which migrate through the estuary. The migratory
fish species associated with the cold-water environment in the Bay/Delta are chinook salmon (

Currently there are four distinct populations of salmon in the Sacramento/San Joaquin river systems, each named
for the season of their migration upstream as adults. The fall-run population is now the most numerous; in recent years,
typically 90 percent of all Central Valley spawners are fall-run fish. Increased hatchery production of fall-run
fish has resulted in stable spawning returns of fall-run fish passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam on the Sacramento
River; however, wild fall-run chinook abundance is low and is decreasing. The Sacramento River system still supports
small winter-run, spring-run and late fall-run populations, but these populations have all declined dramatically
in recent years (USFWS 1992a, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;7). The winter-run population is now listed as threatened
under the ESA. The spring-run population has recently reached low enough levels to be recognized as a species of special
concern by the State of California.

Steelhead trout are also cold-water migratory fish within the Sacramento River System. They have suffered a 90 percent
decline since the late 1960's, and are supported largely by hatchery production (CDFG 1992a, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;14).

The San Joaquin River system supported both fall and spring runs until the 1940's when Friant Dam was built. The dam
prevented the spring-run fish from reaching cool upstream areas suitable for summer rearing, so the spring-run disappeared
and presently there is only a fall-run population. Recently, the San Joaquin population has been highly variable,
reaching very low levels in times of drought, and responding quickly to higher wet year flows. Inadequate stream flows,
water developments, poor water quality, water diversions, and habitat deterioration have had varying degrees of
impact. Continuing high levels of water diversions from the San Joaquin River and tributaries, and high exports out
of the South Delta, in concert with the recent extended drought have caused major impacts to all San Joaquin tributary
runs. Population levels are extremely low, and the 1991 brood year may only produce a total of 100 to 300 returning adults
in 1994 when these adults return to spawn at the end of their three year life cycle (CDFG 1992c, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;25).

Salmon and steelhead populations are subject to increased mortality when exposed to high temperatures and when diverted
out of the main channels of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers into less suitable habitat. Those fish diverted from
the main channels are also subject to increased mortality as water exports at the State and Federal pumping plants
in the south Delta increase. USFWS tagged smolt
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 studies between 1984 and 1989 found that smolts migrating out of the Sacramento River system in the spring survived
on average approximately 3.4 times better in the Sacramento main channel than in the interior (central) Delta. Results
from studies carried out in the spring of 1985 to 1990 showed on average approximately 2 times better survival in the
main channel of the San Joaquin River than in Old River, a secondary channel. Higher temperatures affect smolt mortality
both in the main channel and in the central Delta. For example, the recent (1992) USFWS results from spring tagged smolt
releases into the central Delta showed that mortality was approximately 21/2 times greater at 67 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F than at temperatures of 63

State and federal legislators have recognized the serious threat to the continued existence of migratory fishes
in the Bay/Delta. In 1988, the California State legislature mandated a restoration goal of doubling natural salmon
and steelhead production by the year 2000, and required development of a plan to meet this goal. Salmon, Steelhead
Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act; codified at Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect;6900 et seq. (West 1991).
In response to this mandate, California DFG published the Central Valley Salmon and Steelhead Restoration and Enhancement
Plan in 1990 (CDFG 1990a). California DFG recommended that the State Board adopt an objective of maintaining the survival
rate of salmon smolts passing through the estuary at the ``without projects'' historical level, and listed specific
actions for the consideration of the State Board to implement this objective. Also, Congress recently enacted the
Central Valley Project Improvement Act, which requires that a program be developed and implemented to ensure that
natural production of anadromous fish in Central Valley rivers and streams will be ``sustainable at levels at least
twice the average levels attained during the period 1967&hyph;1991.''

In order to protect fall-run salmon, the 1978 Delta Plan included minimum flow objectives (below those set for striped
bass) and mandated gate closures to help keep fry out of the central Delta when flows were above 12,000 cubic feet per
second (cfs) during the period January 1 to April 15. In addition, gate closures through May, designed to protect striped
bass, have also provided protection for out-migrating salmon smolts. These measures were considered inadequate
by the fisheries agencies (USFWS, NMFS, and California DFG). At the 1987 Water Quality Control Plan hearings, these
agencies recommended flow objectives based on 1940 historical flows (without project levels) that would have significantly
increased protection for fall-run salmon. Similarly, in the 1988 Draft Water Quality Control Plan (SWRCB 1988),
the State Board staff recommended objectives for Sacramento fall-run salmon based on average spring flow conditions
from 1930 to 1987, and for San Joaquin fall-run salmon based on flow conditions from 1953 to 1987. However, this Plan
was not adopted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan established additional criteria designed to protect salmon. The State Board set new temperature
criteria of 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F at Freeport and Vernalis from April 1 through June 30 and September 1 through November 30 to protect Cold Fresh-Water
Habitat for fall-run salmon. The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan also set a temperature criterion of 66
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F at Freeport from January through March to protect winter-run salmon. EPA disapproved these criteria because
the evidence in the State Board's submittal did not demonstrate that they would be sufficient to protect cold-water
habitat for these species. Based on the supporting evidence in the State Board's submittal and the Central Valley
Salmon and Steelhead Restoration and Enhancement Plan (CDFG 1990a), EPA recommended that the State Board adopt a
65 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F criterion, or an alternative that is scientifically defensible. EPA also disapproved the State's temperature
criteria because they were subject to ``controllable factors'' (that is, temperature criteria were to be met only
if they could be attained using a limited set of implementation measures). With this limitation such criteria are
unlikely to be protective, especially since the State Board specifically prohibited the use of reservoir releases
to reduce temperatures in the Delta (SWRCB, 1991).

EPA believes that the State should continue to work on developing scientifically-defensible long-term temperature
criteria sufficient to protect cold-water habitat for salmon migrating through the estuary. Temperature has been
consistently used nationwide as a basis for water quality criteria, and there is strong scientific evidence that
temperature affects survival of salmon smolts as they move through the Delta (Kjelson, et al., 1989; USFWS 1992a,
WRINT-USFWS&hyph;7, USFWS 1992b and USFWS 1992c, WRINT-USFWS&hyph;8). However, EPA acknowledges that specific
temperature criteria are difficult to establish and implement presently in the Delta because historic temperature
levels have been highly variable and respond quickly to ambient air temperatures, and because there is insufficient
information on the effectiveness and feasibility of various methods of lowering temperature. It is likely that there
are short time periods (on the order of days to a few weeks) during which efforts at temperature control could be successful
and provide increased smolt survival. However, existing models predicting changes in temperature in response to
water project operations use a monthly temporal structure and only provide results as monthly means. Thus, these
models cannot be used to analyze measures that could provide improved conditions over shorter periods of time. In
addition, management of reservoir releases to provide benefits to salmon both in the Delta and in the upstream reaches
has not been thoroughly assessed (Kelley, et al. 1991; Mann and Abbott 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies to develop improved reservoir and river temperature models with a shorter time-step and improved predictive
capability for the entire Sacramento system are just beginning under the auspices of Trinity County, the University
of California at Davis, and the California DFG. These studies will also include a direct analysis of the effect of temperature
management alternatives on salmon populations. Additional work to develop effective temperature models has been
mandated by section 3406(g) of the recently-enacted Central Valley Project Improvement Act. It should be possible
to use information from these studies to set temperature criteria in the near future, and EPA will continue to work
with the State to develop specific temperature criteria for the Delta. However, at this time, EPA is not proposing
temperature criteria to replace those criteria disapproved in EPA's September 3, 1991 letter, and is instead proposing
the salmon smolt survival criteria described below.

c. Proposed Smolt Survival Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because at this time EPA has not developed an adequate scientific basis for precise temperature criteria, EPA is proposing
``smolt survival criteria'' to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the Bay/Delta
estuary. These criteria are based on a smolt survival index that quantifies and predicts the survival of salmon migrating
through the Delta. The index can be used to determine whether the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat uses
are impaired in the Bay/Delta. When applied in criteria, the index measures and can control the condition of the resource
at risk by directly assessing and limiting the loss of salmon smolts within the Delta due to a variety of impaired water
quality conditions. The use of this index is consistent with the integrated approach envisioned by the National Program
Guidance for Biological Criteria for Surface Waters (USEPA 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Smolt Survival Models. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The smolt survival indices are based on USFWS models described in Kjelson et al. (1989), USFWS (1992a) (WRINT-USFWS&hyph;7)
and USFWS (1992b). These models are summarized more fully in Appendix III. The models are empirical; that is, they
are in large part based on the results of experiments measuring and comparing smolt survival under a number of different
physical conditions of varying migration pathways, water temperatures, flow rates, and rates of exports from the
Delta. The models underlying the salmon smolt survival criteria are complex; additional information about the methods
used in constructing the Sacramento and San Joaquin indices is contained in Appendix III and the administrative record
to the proposal. For the Sacramento River system, the proposed salmon smolt survival criteria are based on the most
recent model (USFWS 1992b) for predicting migration success for the Sacramento River fall-run population, and rely
on the relationship between smolt survival and three factors: temperature, diversion out of the mainstem Sacramento
River, and export rates. The San Joaquin model is based on experimental data, and relies on the relationship between
salmon smolt survival and river flows, diversion into Old River, and export rates. Consistent with the implementation
recommendations of USFWS, NMFS, and California DFG, the San Joaquin model assumes that a barrier will be in place at
the head of Old River during the peak migration season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verifying the models used to generate the salmon smolt criteria is a continuing process using code-wire tagged smolt
studies conducted by the USFWS (USFWS 1992b, 1993). Although these models represent the present state-of-the-art
in Bay/Delta salmon fisheries management, EPA anticipates that the models will continue to be verified, updated
and refined each year by USFWS to reflect additional data collection results, and believes that continuing verification
is necessary to assure that outmigrating smolts are protected. In the event that USFWS modifies its models, recommended
index values, or recommended implementation measures, EPA intends that the criteria will be amended accordingly
in the next triennial review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Criteria.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In developing the goals or target index values for its proposal, EPA is relying primarily on the goal of restoring habitat
conditions to those existing in the late 1960's and early 1970's, as recommended in the Interagency Statement of Principles.
Strict adherence to this recommendation would suggest using the index values associated with that historical period
as the target index values. These values are included in Table 2, which provides estimated index values for different
historical periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of their recent expert testimony to the State Board, USFWS estimated these historical survival indices under
different conditions (USFWS 1992c, WRINT-USFWS&hyph;8). The Sacramento River historical values are based on an
early version of the Sacramento River model (Kjelson et al. 1989). There would be minor changes in the estimates using
the most up-to-date model (USFWS 1992b). For example, recalculating the Sacramento River value for the 1956&hyph;1970
historical period yields a mean of the five-year types of .37, compared to the .36 indicated in Table 2.

For a number of reasons, however, strict adherence to the late 1960's and early 1970's target is inappropriate. Salmon
fisheries, especially on the San Joaquin River, were already somewhat degraded during that historical period, and
the degradation has been more severe in drier years. This is demonstrated in Table 2, above, which provides estimated
historical survival index values for the relevant period. This Table shows that the decline in the survival index
was more pronounced in critical, dry, and below normal water years than in wetter years. Accordingly, to protect salmon
from falling to dangerously low population levels, and more nearly mimic the natural historical response of smolts
migrating through the Delta to year-to-year changes in hydrology, EPA is proposing more protective target values
in drier years and less in wetter years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the Sacramento River system, EPA believes salmon smolt migration will be protected if the long-term average survival
over all water year types replicates the target historical period values. Protection at the late 1960's to early 1970's
level in the wetter years is not necessary if better protection is afforded migrating smolts in the drier years. On
the San Joaquin River system, however, the drop in survival has been more severe in drier years, the runs are smaller
and more at risk, and the overall survival index was less than in the Sacramento system during the target historical
period. For that reason, in order to protect the Fish Migration designated use on the San Joaquin, EPA is proposing
index values that afford both better protection in drier years and overall index values that are higher than in the
historical late 1960's to early 1970's period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve this level of protection and to address this bias in the historical reference period index values, EPA is
proposing the use of target values derived from the recommendations and analyses carried out by the Delta Team of the
Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee. This interagency group consists of representatives from the USFWS, California
DFG, California DWR, NMFS, and USBR. Its reports (Five Agency Delta Salmon Team, 1991a, 1991b) represent a consensus
on the most effective and feasible implementation measures to protect downstream migrant salmon smolts in the Delta.
In preparing its recommendations for the 1992 State Board hearings, USFWS reviewed recommendations from the Five
Agency Delta Salmon Team in its salmon smolt model, and presented a set of index values and corresponding operational
recommendations to the State Board (USFWS 1992a, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;7; USFWS 1992c). These index values, which
are intended to be consistent with the fisheries agencies recommended target index values that would restore habitat
conditions and salmon populations to those characteristic of the late 1960's to early 1970's (USFWS 1992a, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;7;
USFWS 1992c, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;8; CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8), are shown in Table 3. The values for
the Sacramento River index differ slightly from those presented in the 1992 State Board hearings because these Table
3 values are based on the most recent version of the Sacramento River model.

Finally, in arriving at index values for its proposal contained in Table 4, EPA has adjusted the index values of Table
3 to meet concerns over potential closure of the Georgiana Slough. As discussed below, EPA has been engaged in consultations
with USFWS and NMFS under the ESA about possible effects of EPA's water quality standards actions on threatened and
endangered species. During the course of these consultations, it was suggested that one of the measures the Five Agency
Chinook Salmon Committee had recommended as an effective protective measure for salmon smolts_putting a temporary
barrier at the head of Georgiana Slough_may have deleterious effects on the Delta smelt and other native aquatic life
in the central Delta, and possibly on adult salmon returning upstream. For that reason, EPA has recomputed the index
values (see Table 4) to reflect model results if the Georgiana Slough were left open. Lower exports, particularly
during times of peak San Joaquin salmon outmigration, were incorporated as an additional feasible and effective
implementation measure benefiting salmon, in part to compensate for the additional mortality associated with keeping
Georgiana Slough open. EPA believes that these adjustments still provide protection consistent with the goal of
restoring habitat conditions to those existing in the late 1960's to early 1970's (mean Sacramento River survival
index of .37), while also taking into account achievable implementation measures. The recomputed index values in
Table 4 are included as EPA's proposal.

To protect both Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated, EPA proposes that the specific smolt survival
criteria in Table 4, above, be adopted for the Bay/Delta. As explained above, the proposed Sacramento River criteria
are modified from the USFWS indices in Table 3. The San Joaquin River criteria are the same as Table 3. The Sacramento
River criteria provide overall protection at approximately the 1956&hyph;1970 historical level (.37 mean survival
index). The San Joaquin River criteria provides better protection than the 1956&hyph;1970 historical level (.27
mean survival index). Both sets of criteria provide better protection than the 1956&hyph;1970 historical period
in drier years, and less protection in wetter years. These criteria should provide more consistent smolt survival
and help avoid situations where extraordinary measures are necessary to preserve runs, particularly in the San Joaquin
River tributaries. Water year type designations are identical to State Board classifications (SWRCB 1992a).

d. Implementation Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under the CWA, the States have a primary role in developing measures implementing water quality criteria. EPA expects
that the State Board would implement these criteria by making appropriate revisions to operational requirements
included in water rights permits issued by the State Board. EPA believes that the State Board would have a number of
possible implementation approaches for achieving the salmon smolt survival criteria. In the recent State Board
hearings, USFWS recommended a series of implementation measures (based on the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee
proposals) designed to achieve the smolt survival indices recommended in the joint statement by USFWS, NMFS and EPA.
For the Sacramento River, these included closure of the Delta Cross Channel from April through June, closure of Georgiana
Slough from April 15 to June 15, and minimum Sacramento Flow at Rio Vista of 4000 cfs from April through June. For the
San Joaquin River, these measures included requiring a range of flows from 2,000 to 10,000 cfs at Vernalis from April
15 to May 15; requiring minimum flows of 1000 cfs at Jersey Point from April through June, except from April 15 to May
15, when higher flows from 1000 to 3000 cfs would be required; and placing a full barrier in upper Old River from April
through May. Total water exports would be curtailed to a range from 6000 cfs in wet years to 2000 cfs in critically dry
years from April 15 to May 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the USFWS models, these particular measures will achieve the proposed smolt survival indices in Table 3.
However, as discussed earlier, EPA has incorporated into its proposed target index values changes to the recommended
implementation measures based on concerns about the effect of these measures on other aquatic resources. Given the
nature of the index itself, however, there is substantial flexibility in how the target values can be achieved. For
example, if flows are increased above the recommended levels in the San Joaquin River, the associated export limits
could also be increased while achieving the same level of protection. Reductions in Sacramento River temperatures
would also provide significant benefits. Although temperature controls were not included in the USFWS recommendations,
they are an important variable in the USFWS model, and may be the most significant factor affecting smolt survival
in the Sacramento River system. Implementation measures affecting temperature may therefore be an effective means
of attaining the smolt survival criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also evidence that short-term operational changes implemented at peak migration times coincident with
critical periods of high ambient air and water temperature may provide significant benefits (Kelley, et al, 1991).

(CDFG 1990) include screening Georgiana Slough and screening the Delta Cross Channel. A sound barrier (a device generating
subsurface sound that discourages fish from entering the Slough) at Georgiana Slough is currently under study and
may also be a useful implementation measure. As new methods are developed to increase smolt survival, their benefits
can be assessed, and their contribution toward meeting and/or revising the criteria taken into account.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given this potential flexibility, EPA believes that establishing smolt survival indices as Fish Migration and Cold
Fresh-Water Habitat criteria would give the State Board maximum latitude in choosing a set of implementation methods
that will attain protection of the designated migration and coldwater fisheries uses. As such, these proposed criteria
are consistent with the mandates of section 101(g) of the CWA, as discussed above, and accommodate the State's interest
in allocating its water supplies in a way that maximizes the many values important to the State. Furthermore, the proposal
of these criteria is consistent with the authority in CWA section 303(c)(4), which authorizes EPA to propose revised
or new standards to meet the requirements of the Act.

e. Protection of Other Salmon Runs and Life Stages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the smolt survival indices were developed using tagged fall-run fish during the time of their outmigration,
EPA is proposing the use of these indices only for fall-run outmigrants. For winter-, late fall-, and spring-run salmon,
as well as steelhead, there is no direct information about the factors that affect survival, although it is likely
that many of the same factors, with the exception of temperatures during the colder months, are also affecting the
juveniles of these populations as they migrate through the Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Measures implemented by the USBR and SWP as a result of the Biological Opinion for winter-run salmon issued by NMFS
under the ESA afford some protection for other runs, in addition to protection for the winter-run salmon population
itself. NMFS, Biological Opinion on Central Valley Project, 1992 Operations (February 14, 1992). In addition, EPA
has been consulting with NMFS to assure that the implementation of EPA's proposed standards will not jeopardize the
winter-run Chinook salmon population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Juvenile spring-run salmon and steelhead move through the Delta during the same period as winter-run and fall-run
salmon, and should be protected in the Delta by measures taken for these other runs. Late fall-run salmon, however,
outmigrate in fall and early winter, and are currently not fully protected during their passage through the Delta.
Protective criteria for this run should be developed by the State Board in the near future to ensure that this run is
protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Younger salmon, or fry, also enter the Delta, particularly when rainstorms stimulate the movement of fry out of the
tributaries and into the lower Rivers and Delta. Some protection for these fry is afforded by the current State Board
standards requiring closure of the Delta Cross Channel gates when flows are higher than 12,000 cfs. However, closure
of the Cross Channel gates alone may not be protective enough, since fry can be swept into the central Delta through
Georgiana Slough and upstream to the export pumps when there is reverse flow in the lower San Joaquin River, especially
during times of high export. For that reason, Delta habitat conditions for fry may need to be addressed by the State
Board in the future.

f. Protection of Other Migrating Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Species other than salmonids seasonally migrate into and out of the Delta for spawning and as juveniles. These species
include striped bass, Delta smelt, longfin smelt, white and green sturgeon, American shad and Sacramento splittail.
With the exception of temperature, the factors that lead to successful migration of salmonid smolts are also important
for successful migration of the juveniles of these species into the lower embayments. Therefore, EPA's proposed
salmon smolt survival criteria, although specifically addressing fall-run Chinook salmon, will also help protect
migration of these other migrating species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In California, striped bass spawn primarily in the warmer freshwater segments of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.
Protection of spawning in both river systems is important to ensure the genetic diversity of the population as well
as to increase the size of the overall striped bass population. Adults spawn by migrating upstream from the San Francisco
Bay or from the Pacific Ocean (Stevens 1979; Wang 1986). The precise location and time of spawning appear to be controlled
by temperature and salinity (Turner 1972a; Turner and Chadwick 1972). According to the California DFG, striped bass
spawn successfully only in freshwater with electrical conductivities less than 0.44 millimhos
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per centimeter electroconductivity (mmhos/cm EC), and prefer to spawn in waters with conductivities below 0.33
mmhos/cm. Conductivities greater than 0.55 mmhos/cm appear to block the upstream migration of adult spawners (Radtke
and Turner 1967; SWRCB 1987; CDFG 1990b, WQCP&hyph;DFG&hyph;4).

The salinity problems addressed by the isohaline criteria outlined above are caused primarily by salt water intrusion
and are traditionally measured by ``parts per thousand''. In contrast, salinity conditions upstream in freshwater
are generally affected by dissolved salts from upstream water runoff. The salinity content of freshwater is traditionally
measured by its electroconductivity or ``EC'' standardized to 25 C (specific conductance), and is expressed in terms
of millimhos per centimeter electroconductivity or ``mmhos/cm EC''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Sacramento River, adults migrate to spawning sites upstream of Sacramento until they encounter the appropriate
warmer temperatures for spawning. Because of the higher volume of water in the Sacramento River and the particular
constituents and volume of nonpoint source discharges into the river, salinity does not appear to be a serious limitation
on spawning at any location along the river. In years of higher spring river flows, with correspondingly lower water
temperatures, bass can spawn further upstream and later in the April-June period because the warmer temperatures
that induce spawning occur later (Chadwick 1958). Migration and spawning in the Sacramento River are therefore not
adversely affected by salinity. In the smaller and shallower San Joaquin River, however, the earlier occurrence
of warm temperatures causes the peak spawning period to occur earlier than in the Sacramento River; the San Joaquin
peak usually occurs in April or May rather than in May or June (Chadwick 1958). Migrating bass seeking the warmer waters
encounter excessive upstream salinity caused primarily by runoff. This salinity can block migration up the San Joaquin
River, thereby reducing spawning, and can also reduce survival of eggs (Farley 1966; Radtke 1966; Radtke and Turner
1967; Turner and Farley 1971; Turner 1972a, 1972b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Board's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan established objectives of 1.5 mmhos/cm EC at Antioch and 0.44 mmhos/cm EC at
Prisoners Point in April and May. EPA disapproved these objectives, in part, because they are not adequate to protect
spawning habitat in the reach farther upstream between Prisoners Point and Vernalis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1987 State Board hearings, California DFG testified that striped bass formerly spawned farther up the San Joaquin
River, but that this has occurred less frequently in recent years because of increased salinity levels (CDFG 1987).
Salinity in the San Joaquin River increases upstream of Prisoners Point due to reduced freshwater inflow and agricultural
return flows. Thus the absence of salinity criteria above Prisoners Point effectively establishes a barrier to adult
migration and spawning farther upstream on the San Joaquin River (Turner 1972a,b). California DFG also suggested
that there was a danger of losing the part of the population that spawned in this area if high salinities prevent spawning
or decrease survival of newly spawned eggs (CDFG 1987; SWRCB. Phase I Hearing Transcript, LXXV, VII 111:3&hyph;14).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan, the State Board described several alternative water quality standards that would have
extended the protection of spawning conditions upstream of Prisoners Point, including one alternative very similar
to the one EPA is proposing today. However, the State Board deferred adoption of revised standards, apparently because
of concern that improved spawning conditions would lead to greater losses of young to entrainment at the State and
Federal pumping plants. As indicated in its September 3, 1991 letter disapproving certain State criteria, EPA believes
that the State Board can, in developing its implementation measures, address the impact of the pumps on this spawning
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also disapproved the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan spawning criteria because they were not based on sound science. The State
Board explained that the 1.5 mmhos/cm EC criteria at Antioch was intended to protect spawning habitat upstream of
Antioch (near Jersey Point), not at the Antioch location itself. The State Board acknowledged that ``the use of 1.5
[mmhos/cm] EC at Antioch appears not to be generally appropriate, and proposed that a thorough review of this [criteria]
be undertaken at the next triennial review'' (1991 Bay/Delta Plan, p. 5&hyph;32). EPA found this indirect and unproven
approach of setting criteria downstream in hopes of attaining different criteria upstream deficient, and disapproved
it. EPA's proposed criteria would correct this deficiency by establishing the scientifically-defensible criteria
at Jersey Point, the actual point of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Board also acknowledged that the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan spawning criteria did not protect the spawning reach
in the lower San Joaquin River, but instead only at two locations: Jersey Point and Prisoners Point (1991 Bay/Delta
Plan, p. 5&hyph;30). As a result, the State Board directed California DFG to study how a specific habitat zone of 0.44
mmhos/cm EC could be established in the entire reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners Point ``to make certain that
the State Board develops water quality objectives that are based on sound scientific data'' (1991 Bay/Delta Plan,
p. 5&hyph;33). EPA agrees, and is proposing criteria to assure that the entire reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners
Point should be protected.

b. Proposed Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its September 3, 1991 letter and subsequent correspondence with the Board, EPA recommended salinity criteria
of 0.44 mmhos/cm EC in the lower San Joaquin River in the reach from Jersey Point and Vernalis. After further reviewing
the scientific evidence, EPA is proposing the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The 14-day running average of the mean daily EC shall not be more than 0.44 mmhos/cm for the period April 1 to May 31 in
wet, above normal, and below normal years at the following stations: Jersey Point, San Andreas Landing, Prisoners
Point, Buckley Cove, Rough and Ready Island, Brandt Bridge, Mossdale, and Vernalis. In dry and critical water years,
the criteria are required only in the reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners Point, as measured at Jersey Point,
San Andreas Landing, and Prisoners Point.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These criteria will fully protect the historic spawning range of striped bass on the lower San Joaquin River, while
reflecting the natural variability in salinity levels in different water year types.

c. Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the CWA, the states have a primary role in developing measures implementing water quality criteria. EPA expects
that the State Board would implement these criteria by making appropriate revisions to operational requirements
included in water rights permits issued by the State Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Compliance With Endangered Species Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has concluded that its promulgation of water quality criteria for the Bay/Delta may affect certain species protected
by the federal ESA. These include the winter-run chinook salmon (listed as threatened and proposed for reclassification
as endangered), the Delta smelt (listed as threatened), and the Sacramento splittail and longfin smelt (both the
subject of petitions for listing). There are also a number of listed and proposed species resident in Suisun Marsh.
Under section 7 of the ESA and accompanying regulations, EPA is required to consult with NMFS (on the winter-run chinook
salmon) and USFWS (on the other listed and proposed species) to assure that the water quality criteria promulgated
by EPA do not jeopardize the continued existence of these species or adversely affect their critical habitat. 50 CFR
402.14 and &sect;402.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has worked closely with NMFS and USFWS over the past two years to meet its obligations under the ESA. The federal
agencies have recognized the need to take an integrated ecosystem approach to the Bay/Delta rather than a fragmented,
species-by-species approach. To that end, the EPA, NMFS, and USFWS issued a joint proposal to the State Board's 1992
hearings on interim measures recommending that the State Board adopt an immediate goal of restoration of habitat
conditions to those characteristic of the late 1960's and early 1970's. By targeting this level of protection, the
agencies intended to establish habitat conditions that would protect and preserve the entire range of fish and wildlife
uses in the Bay/Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria proposed in this notice follow this approach to habitat protection within the Bay/Delta watershed.
Pursuant to 50 CFR &sect;&sect;402.14, EPA has initiated formal consultations with USFWS and NMFS on the potential
effects of its action on endangered and threatened species. The agencies have agreed to finalize these consultations
before EPA promulgates water quality standards in the Bay/Delta.

D. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires EPA and other agencies to assess the potential costs and benefits of all significant
regulatory actions. Significant regulatory actions are those that impose a cost on the economy of $100 million or
more annually or have certain regulatory, policy, or economic impacts. Today's proposed rule meets the criteria
of a significant regulatory action set forth in section 3(f) of the Executive Order. The regulatory analysis for this
proposed rule is presented in ``Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Proposed Water Quality Standards for the
San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta'' (see Section F for the availability of this and other documents).
This draft RIA was submitted to OMB for review as required by the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's action is the proposal of water quality standards and this action explicitly does not include a proposed implementation
plan. The implementation plan has not yet been developed by the State. Therefore, this draft RIA analyses a range of
possible implementation scenarios. Importantly, the analysis illustrates that the level of costs for the same level
of environmental benefits varies significantly depending on assumptions in implementation scenarios. Specifically,
mechanisms for economically-efficient allocation of water or for the widespread distribution of responsibility,
such as water transfers and/or a drought water bank, result in the most cost-effective scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is committed to working with the State on an implementation plan and welcomes additional information and analysis
on the economic costs and benefits of its proposals. EPA is interested in both improved information and policies and
programs to minimize the economic impacts upon water users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft RIA evaluated the costs and benefits of the combined federal proposals, including EPA's proposed water
quality standards and USFWS's actions under the ESA. The primary method of implementation is assumed to be increased
Delta outflow resulting in reduced water supplies to urban and agricultural water users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, critical habitat designation may result in additional costs by possibly limiting sand and gravel operations
and affecting marina operations. Benefits are to the Delta ecosystem as a whole, species diversity, and commercial
and recreational fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Assessment of Costs and Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft RIA shows that the costs to both agricultural and urban water users would depend upon how water supplies are
allocated to implement the proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The primary method for implementing the combined federal proposals will be increases in Delta outflow. Current
estimates of the additional outflow developed by the California DWR are 540,000 acre-feet on average and 1.1 million
acre-feet in critically dry years.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The analysis uses an initial distribution of water supply reductions between agricultural users (80% of the
reductions) and urban users (the remaining 20%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of three scenarios analyzed are presented in the draft RIA and are briefly summarized here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Agricultural impacts are influenced by improved irrigation efficiency, crop shifting opportunities, the
size of the affected region and opportunities for water trading between agricultural districts. A range of these
options was modeled, except for irrigation efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A middle range distribution of supply impacts (Scenario 2) that includes water trading between agricultural
districts results in producer surplus losses (net revenue losses) of $20 million dollars on average. If trading is
limited (Scenario 1), impacts are estimated to be $44 million on average. Scenario 3 illustrates the lowest cost option,
distributing the water supply reductions throughout the Central Valley, resulting in producer surplus losses estimates
of $8 million on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Economic impacts were estimated for critically dry years and indicate larger economic impacts, because lower
cost options are already used up in drought years. Scenario 1, where trading is limited, estimates $147 million in
costs in critically dry years. Scenario 2, where trading is facilitated among agricultural districts, reduces those
impacts by nearly half to $87 million in impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential impacts on the urban users were more difficult to estimate, given the less-established analytic information
base. Three scenarios were developed to project the economic impacts based upon different assumptions and implementation
choices. Key implementation choices analyzed include the availability of transfers, drought water pricing, a drought
water bank and increased water reclamation. Additional water management choices include increased conservation,
conjunctive use and other demand management programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Water transfers and an efficient drought water bank are key to minimizing impacts on urban users, given increased
environmental needs. In the least-cost scenario, (Scenario 3) impacts on urban users were projected to be $25 million
on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under Scenario 2, where reclamation meets urban supply needs along with a combination of drought water pricing
and a more limited drought water bank, impacts are approximately $50&hyph;54 million on average. Under Scenario
1, where no drought water bank exists, impacts are projected at $80 million on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The economic impacts of the proposals are highest in drought years, when fewer supplies are available to meet
increased urban and environmental needs. Estimation of consumer surplus losses for Scenario 3 projects a continuation
of the 1991 drought water bank resulting in economic costs of $70 million in a critically dry year. A combination of
a more limited drought water bank and drought water pricing results in consumer surplus losses of $184&hyph;223 million
for Scenario 2. Scenario 1, where no drought water bank exists, results in consumer surplus losses of $450 million
in a critically dry year. However, EPA projects that these losses are not likely given the support for a drought water
bank as a drought management option. Further, consumer surplus losses do not measure water bill increases in the drought
case because consumers have demonstrated in drought periods that they change their water use practices rather than
pay higher rates. Accordingly, an undetermined portion of these estimates is the value of inconvenience and changes
in behavior during drought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the draft RIA also estimated employment impacts for agriculture associated with the implementation
of these proposals. The direct employment effects were estimated to be a reduction of 99 person-years on average,
but 1926 person-years in a critically dry year for Scenario 2 (water trading allowed between agricultural districts).
If water trading between agricultural districts is limited, employment impacts are estimated to be higher, with
828 person years on average and 3282 person years in a critically dry year. These estimates are not predicted employment
changes (e.g impacts that would effect the actual unemployment rate) because they do not account for a full labor market
equilibrium analysis.

Assessment of Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Background: The Bay/Delta estuary constitutes one of the largest habitats for fish and wildlife in the United States.
The estuary supports more than 120 fish species and provides a stopover or home for more than half of the waterfowl and
shorebirds migrating on the Pacific Flyway. Suisun Marsh, which is within the Bay/Delta estuary, supports many rare
plant and animal species. Maintenance of freshwater, estuarine, and wildlife habitat would preserve rare and endangered
species; permit fish migration; and provide opportunities for commercial ocean fishing and sport fishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualitative assessment: The combined proposed requirements will increase the protection of the estuarine habitat
in the Delta and will benefit the ecosystem overall. In addition, the combined proposal is expected to increase biological
productivity of such important resources as salmon, striped bass, and waterfowl; protect diversity of species,
such as Delta smelt, longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail, that are unique to the Bay/Delta ecosystem; increase
commercial and recreational fishing opportunities; and increase opportunities for wildlife observation resulting
from restoration of riparian and tidal marsh habitat and ecosystem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits associated with the federal proposals are described qualitatively for most ecosystem benefits. Some fish
population increases were estimated and a portion of the commercial and recreational fishery benefits were monetized.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The benefits of the federal proposals are an increase in biological productivity and ecosystem health for
the Bay/Delta ecosystem. This increase includes protecting unique species from extinction. Bay/Delta species
that currently might qualify for listing under the ESA include the longfin smelt, spring-run Chinook salmon, Sacramento
splittail, green sturgeon, and Red Hills Roach, in addition to the already listed winter-run Chinook salmon and Delta
smelt. A potential benefit of the federal proposals is that the ecosystem health might improve to the point where unlisted
species need not be listed, or presently listed species could be delisted under the ESA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Well-established relationships between estuarine conditions and populations exist for many estuarine
species. The extent of the low salinity habitat in the estuary is closely associated with the abundance and distribution
of estuarine species at all trophic levels. Increased populations were estimated for salmon (increasing by approximately
90,000 salmon), striped bass (increasing by approximately 10 percent), and starry flounder. In addition, populations
of other game species of green and white sturgeon, bay shrimp, American shad and white catfish are expected to increase.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A portion of these population increases will accrue to the recreational or commercial fisheries. Not less
than $9&hyph;11 million annually were estimated, again with many benefits not estimated in dollar value. The majority
of these gains are in the commercial salmon fishery. Employment gains in the salmon fishery were estimated to increase
by 300&hyph;360 jobs annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Many other recreation activities, including hunting, boating, and nature appreciation are expected to be
enhanced by the proposed regulations; however, the estimated change in participation in these activities could
not be quantified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enhancing the natural environment of the Bay/Delta would have nonuse social benefits. Although these benefits
could not be quantified, it is believed that they constitute the largest portion of the total value to society of implementing
the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enhancing water quality in the Bay/Delta could result in other benefits associated with the avoidance of listing
additional species and associated increased flexibility in water management and the avoided costs of further collapse
of the ecosystem and its associated fisheries and dependent communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Costs and Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monetized social costs and benefits of the federal proposals are not directly comparable in this analysis because
some use benefits to fisheries and non-use benefits of ecological improvement and species diversity cannot be estimated.
However, two conclusions can be drawn: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The implementation plan for the federal proposals has not yet been developed, thereby making it difficult
to project actual levels of economic impacts. However, it is reasonable to assume that cost-effective solutions
will be pursued that include a flexible approach to meeting Delta requirements. Thus, economic costs in the agricultural
sector are estimated to be $20 million on average and $25 million for the urban sector. However, the overall costs may
be lower than the total, given that at least some of the increases in urban costs will be payments to agriculture for
water transferred. The benefits are estimated to be $10 million from improved commercial fisheries, and unquantified
but important ecological, scientific, educational and existence values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Costs and benefits are difficult to compare directly in this case because of the non-marginal nature of ecosystem
protection and species protection. These benefits, including preventing the extinction of several candidate or
listed species and preventing the collapse of the Bay/Delta ecosystem, account for the majority of benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Given both the monetary estimates of benefits and the qualitative information on benefits not expressed in
dollar value, EPA believes that the proposal can be implemented in a cost-effective manner where a healthy estuary
and fisheries can co-exist with a strong agricultural and urban sector. Given all the available information, the
benefits are commensurate with the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Comprehensive analyses of the incremental response of costs and benefits to marginal changes in EPA's proposed
rule have not been prepared. However, EPA has developed in the draft RIA a method for roughly estimating incremental
changes in economic costs based on changes in the number of days of compliance with the proposed salinity criteria
at particular locations in the estuary. These estimates are based on the estimates of the flows necessary to maintain
the criteria at the target locations. For example, the difference in water supply impacts between a day of protection
at Chipps Island and a day of protection at the Confluence is 12,276 AF/year. These estimates of the difference in water
supply impact can be compared to the dollar value of that water, which the draft RIA estimates as being $90 per AF.

E. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;601, et seq., requires EPA and other federal agencies to prepare an
initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IFRA). EPA's internal guidelines require that an IFRA include a profile
of the small entities and determine if the statutory authority allows consideration of alternative implementation
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the action does not allow consideration of alternative implementation actions. First, under
the Clean Water Act, water quality criteria must be based solely on science. Second, EPA is promulgating water quality
criteria that in effect supplement state criteria that fail to meet the requirements of the CWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has prepared an abbreviated regulatory flexibility analysis. It's findings include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Minimizing the impacts on small farms can be accomplished by developing the least costly implementation plan,
which distributes water supply reductions widely and facilitates trading between water districts. Given that allocation
of water at the farm level depends primarily on decisions at the irrigation district level, determining which size
farm would experience water supply impacts will also be difficult at the State level.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written public comments are invited on all issues raised in this notice. EPA is especially interested in soliciting
public comments on the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA requests comments on the feasibility of setting water quality criteria based on a smooth function rather than
on the mean value for each water year type categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony at recent State Board hearings criticized the use of water year type categories. Because water year types
can change as the year progresses, criteria based on the historical mean for each water year type can cause major changes
in project operations and habitat conditions if a given year shifts from one water year type to another. For example,
a later season storm could cause the water year type to be reclassified from the below normal category to the above normal
category. This shift would increase the number of required days of compliance at Chipps Island from 119 to 144 days.
Such large and sudden changes are inefficient for water resource management and can harm aquatic resources by dewatering
or washing away newly spawned eggs. One formulation of the criteria that could provide for more gradual shifts is described
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California DWR, USBR, and others have suggested that a smooth function should replace the use of means for each water
year type category. Use of these smooth function equations would result in the same average number of days required
for each year type but would involve higher numbers in wetter years within the category and lower numbers for the drier
years within each category. Incorporation of a smooth function would likely ease the actual operational procedure
to meet the criteria and would avoid the relatively large scale changes in operations that might come from a shift in
the determination of year type as spring progresses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has discussed the use of a smooth function criteria with water project operators and the State Board, and has thus
far received a very positive response. Because it is a new approach that has not received substantial scrutiny in California,
EPA's proposal above relies on the traditional water year type classification. However, if public comments do not
raise any significant issues preventing its use, EPA would be inclined to use the smooth function criteria as an alternative
to the water year type classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion below describes one possible approach to the construction of a smooth function criteria, and compares
the potential effects of those functions with the traditional water year type criteria. Because no critically dry
years occurred in the reference period it is necessary to extrapolate from the four year types for which there are data
to the critical year type. Fortunately, there is a very high correlation among the four points (Figs. 1 and 2). These
extrapolations allow the required number of days at Roe and Chipps Islands in each year type to be described as a pair
of smooth functions.

This equation produces a wide range of required number of days within most year types and in all but wet years would involve
a range of about thirty days. Use of the equation would result in little variance within wet years.

The relationship between number of days at Port Chicago and Sacramento Basin Index (Figure 3) yields differences
of required number of days within year types of as much as 40 days in dry years. With the difference in flows required
to sustain the isohaline at Port Chicago (29,000 cfs) and Chipps Island (12,000 cfs), the theoretical difference
in water costs within a year type could be substantial. The actual costs are likely to be lower, however, because flows
sufficient to trigger the standard are often followed by a considerable period of elevated flows sufficient to meet
the required number of days. These differences are likely to be fully realized in dry and critical years when conditions
in the Delta are fully controlled by the projects.

The relationship between number of days at Chipps Island and Sacramento Basin Index (Figure 4) yields very small ranges
about the mean for all but critical years. However, use of a smooth function is justified because of the open-ended
nature of critical years. The driest year on record had a Sacramento Basin Index of 3.1, but the index theoretically
could approach 0. This wide span of possible index values in the critical year type is best handled by the smooth function
described. The smaller flows this standard entails (12,000 cfs at Chipps and 5,800 cfs at the confluence) and the small
range of values within all but critical year types yields smaller differences in water costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, a smooth function to determine the number of days of compliance would result in the same average number
of days for each year type, but would more accurately reflect differences within these categories. Hence, small adjustments
could be made in project operations as the water year progresses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of a smooth function addresses, to some extent, the issue of adjusting habitat protection requirements in
extended droughts. The present identification of year type is based on the Sacramento River Index. That index combines
three variables: (1) Precipitation in the April through September period when flood control requirements are reduced
and more precipitation can be held in reservoirs, (2) the index of the previous year which partly reflects the amount
of carry-over storage, and (3) precipitation in the October through March period. The index weights these three factors
in a 40:30:30 ratio. For the purpose of protecting estuarine habitat, the precipitation in February to June and the
amount of carry-over storage may be more important than precipitation in the rest of the year. EPA is requesting comments
on the possibility of modifying the Sacramento River Index for purposes of developing the salinity criteria as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The criteria could calculate an index weighted more toward the previous year's Sacramento River Index and the
February through June precipitation. A 40:40:20 ratio or even 50:50:0 index might be a more appropriate basis for
the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The criteria could start each February with a baseline set of requirements and add or subtract days at each of the
two downstream sites based on how conditions in each month differ from the average conditions for that month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPA is including a 14 day rolling averaging period in its proposed salinity criteria. As discussed above, the 14
day period was included to assure that the range of spring to neap tidal conditions was included in the averaging period.
Accounting for the effects of tidal influences is important, especially for the downstream compliance location
at Roe Island. During its discussions of this proposal with the operators of California's major water projects, it
was suggested that a 28 day rolling average or other averaging period may be more appropriate, so that the entire tidal
cycle is included. EPA's preliminary review of this suggestion indicates that it would be an appropriate device for
accounting for tidal influences, and would not have any detrimental impact on protecting the designated Estuarine
Habitat use. Therefore, if public comments do not raise any significant issues, EPA would be inclined to use a 28 day
averaging period. EPA, therefore, is requesting comments on the following alternative approaches to the averaging
period: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The proposed criteria could be measured using a 28 day rolling average, thereby lengthening the averaging period
to encompass the full range of tidal strengths and giving an overall effect of the tidal cycle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The criteria could measure compliance with a rolling average but allow discontinuities in the averaging period.
Thus, days on which meteorological conditions interfere with achieving the 2 ppt criteria at Roe Island would be counted
instead as days of meeting the criteria upstream at Chipps Island. This approach could be applied only until all days
that are required at the upstream site are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. As a part of EPA's coordination process in developing this proposal, the Agency has discussed its proposed criteria
at length with the operators of California's major water projects. These operators, who will have substantial responsibilities
under any implementation plan developed by the State Board, raised a question about how compliance with the 2 ppt salinity
criteria should be measured. Under existing operational models, these operators would translate the proposed criteria
into a set of flow parameters, and would operate the system pursuant to those flow parameters so as to achieve the 2 ppt
salinity criteria at the targeted sites. However, because all models contain imperfections, it has been proposed
that the operators should actually model compliance at a site somewhat downstream of the targeted site so as to provide
a ``margin of error'' or a ``confidence interval''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's preliminary review of this issue suggests that use of a ``confidence interval'' of this kind is unwarranted,
for two primary reasons. First, the model that predicts the location of the 2 ppt isohaline based on flows is extremely
accurate. EPA's preliminary review of the model's accuracy during the five months covered by the proposed salinity
criteria, using historical data, found that the model correctly predicts the number of days for the isohaline position
more than 95 percent of the time. Second, the use of a 28 day averaging period, as described above, would adequately
address most of the variability associated with factors not included in the salinity-flow model. For these reasons,
EPA believes that the use of these proposed confidence intervals would require substantial additional flows through
the estuary without any corresponding ecological benefit to the Estuarine Habitat designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that the State Board will develop an implementation plan for these Estuarine Habitat criteria by changing
the volume and timing of water flows through the estuary. EPA believes that an implementation plan that relies on the
salinity-flow model, without making additional allowances for confidence intervals as described above, would
be acceptable for purposes of protecting the designated use. Further, EPA notes that the State's triennial review
provides a mechanism for regularly reviewing the adequacy of any implementation decisions concerning confidence
intervals for the proposed salinity criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comment from the public on this issue, and welcomes any evaluation on the merits of the use of this or other
forms of confidence intervals with the proposed criteria. Specifically, EPA requests comment on whether the proposed
criteria without the above confidence interval adjustment would be protective. Alternatively, would a confidence
interval based on an extended number of days of compliance at the targeted sites yield the desired level of confidence
without requiring the higher flows required by the confidence interval proposal outlined above? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Will these criteria be adequate to protect low-salinity habitat conditions in wetter years? The SFEP workshop
that developed the scientific rationale for an estuarine index based their conclusions on correlations between
mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline during appropriate months and the abundance of estuarine organisms at all trophic
levels. With the exception of mollusks, yearly measures of abundance increase either linearly or logarithmically
as the mean location of the 2 ppt isohaline moves down the estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has developed its proposed Estuarine Habitat criteria based on the number of days at particular locations in the
estuary, rather than a mean position over a series of months. These criteria have the advantage of being more easily
implemented, and more directly tie certain salinity ranges to certain geographic locations (such as the extensive
shallows of Grizzly Bay). However, basing the number of days on a certain historical period (such as 1940 to 1975) does
not mean that the mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline for these reference years will be achieved. By using the historical
period of 1940 to 1975 to define the number of days at each location, we are approximating the actual historical (late
1960's to early 1970's) mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline in drier years. However, EPA's criteria may not provide
overall conditions equal to those during the late 1960's to early 1970's. This is because the mean position of the 2
ppt isohaline in wetter years has been substantially downstream of the wetter year positions in the proposed rule
(see Table below).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
These wetter years are an important component of the natural hydrology; 40 percent of the last 50 years have been in
the ``wet'' category. They are years of very high productivity for the estuary, and are likely to provide a buffer for
times of low productivity, especially for those species living longer than one or two years. Such variability also
encourages diversity, such as the plant diversity in brackish tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay. While many of the
winter/spring flows during these years are presently considered ``uncontrollable,'' a number of new water projects
have been proposed that would capture part of these flows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One concern about the future development of these ``uncontrolled'' flows involves a possible decrease in the frequency
with which triggering conditions will occur. The level of protection afforded by the Roe Island standard would be
reduced if additional upstream water developments decrease uncontrolled wintertime flows, thus reducing the frequency
with which the standard is triggered. EPA welcomes comments on how this standard should be modified to reflect future
changes in upstream water development facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional concern about the protection of conditions in wetter years is that some wet years are much more productive
than others. By developing standards that can be met in all wet years some of the biological values associated with
exceptional years is not included. Part of the difficulty of developing criteria to protect the biological value
of these wetter years arises from the open-ended nature of the wet year category. Recent wet years include years as
different as 1983 and 1986. In 1983, precipitation, both rain and snow, was heavy throughout the winter and spring.
In 1986, on the other hand, a large tropical storm produced record-setting precipitation which lasted for a brief
period and fell almost entirely as rain. Although both these were wet years, 1983 had about three times the amount of
precipitation of 1986 and, because of the heavy snowfall, a much higher amount of water was available for use. Possible
ways to protect the value of wet year habitats include the use of triggered standards downstream of Roe Island or by
requiring more days at Roe Island in the wettest years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA welcomes suggestions on the proper level of protection that should be provided during these wetter periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One of the critical elements of EPA's proposal is the determination of the proper historical reference period for
developing target numbers of days when the 2 ppt isohaline is at a particular point in the estuary. As discussed above,
EPA is recommending a level of protection for the Bay/Delta similar to that existing during the late 1960's to early
1970's. To estimate the hydrological conditions during the late 1960's to early 1970's across the five water year
categories, EPA is proposing using the 1940 to 1975 period as the historical reference period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The choice of years to include in the historical reference period can strongly affect the number of days when the 2 ppt
isohaline is at a particular point. Incremental changes in the number of days have corresponding incremental effects
on the water supply impacts of these proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the building of Shasta Dam, uncontrolled spring runoffs resulted in as many as 150 days when the 2 ppt isohaline
was located at or below Chipps Island, even in critical years, whereas in recent years there have been as few as 0 days.
In developing the proposed rule, EPA has used the period between October 1939 and September 1975 to represent the period
when the conditions in the estuary were sufficient to protect the designated fisheries uses. As explained above,
this span of years provides the greatest number of examples of each year type during the period after the massive changes
in hydrology due to the construction of the Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and the Friant Dam on the San Joaquin but
before the most dramatic recent declines in fishery abundance. Even so, the chosen historical reference period contains
no examples of critical years and only three examples of above normal years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One example of the variability of conditions within the chosen historical reference period involves the Chipps Island
location. There is a great deal of variability in the number of days the 2 ppt isohaline was at Chipps Island within each
of the drier year types in the historical reference period. Although the years with fewest days occurs later in the
period there are examples of later years with more days than earlier years. The following table gives the number of
days that the 2 ppt isohaline was west of Chipps Island for each dry and below normal year in the historical period. The
latest examples of dry years in the proposed reference period, 1964 and 1961, had the fewest days at Chipps Island.
These two dry years, however, were immediately preceded by a dry year (1960) with a number of days at Chipps Island substantially
greater than the historical mean, and the year with the third lowest number of days at Chipps actually occurred in 1947.
The absence of a strong pattern of decreasing days at Chipps Island over time was the principal basis for EPA's use of
as broad a historical period as possible, the full period from 1940 to 1975, as the historical reference period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
During the development of EPA's proposal, it has been suggested that the years 1964 to 1976 could be used as an alternative
historical reference period. This period almost literally replicates the intended late 1960's to early 1970's.
EPA has not chosen that period for two reasons. First, it is an extremely limited sample of the variation of conditions
within water year categories. Second, including the year 1976 is inappropriate, given that by 1976 the decline of
certain aquatic resources was already apparent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another suggested possibility is that use of the 1955 to 1975 time period may be a better indicator of conditions in
the late 1960's to early 1970's. The 1955&hyph;1975 period excludes water years before the CVP's pumping facilities
were operational, but still provides a larger sample across certain water year types than would using the 1965 to 1974
period alone. As the table above indicates, using this 1955 to 1975 period would decrease the number of Chipps Island
days from 116 to approximately 104 days during dry years, and from 119 to approximately 104 days during below normal
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not use this 1955&hyph;1975 period as the historical reference period because, as explained above, it believes
the 1940 to 1975 period provides a larger and more representative sample of hydrological conditions across all year
types similar to those in the late 1960's to early 1970's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the importance of this issue, EPA requests comments on the suitability of the above suggestions or of other historical
reference periods for the salinity criteria. EPA is especially interested in how the use of alternative periods could
provide a better estimate of the hydrological and ecological conditions in the estuary in the late 1960's to early
1970's. In addition, EPA is soliciting comment on alternative approaches to developing reference conditions for
water year types for which there are limited historical examples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. During the spawning season, several species appear to be carried through the Delta to Suisun Bay during periods
of elevated Delta flows caused by upstream storm events. The proposed Roe Island salinity criteria are partly intended
to protect the normal dispersal of these young fish throughout Suisun Bay over a number of tidal cycles. As explained
in more detail above, the proposed Roe Island criteria include a ``trigger'' that activates the criteria only after
natural hydrological conditions push the 2 ppt isohaline to Roe Island. EPA is requesting comment on this trigger,
including comment on the following specific questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would a trigger at some upstream site, such as Middle Ground, retain the desired link to storm events while ensuring
a more frequent triggering of the standard? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should the criteria be triggered only by storm events actually occurring in the February through June period?
This refinement would prevent the criteria from being triggered, for example, solely by a large storm occurring in
January, the runoff from which may keep the 2 ppt isohaline below Roe Island into February. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Should the trigger be stated as a single day when mean salinities are less than 2 ppt, or by a longer averaging period
(14 days, 28 days, etc.)?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(d) It has been suggested that the need for a trigger might be eliminated by setting a criteria at a location further
upstream. Both USFWS and USBR have suggested developing a criteria at Middle Ground (at roughly km 68). At this location
the criteria would be triggered in all but critical years and would thereby provide an increased level of protection
overall. Even though a Middle Ground criteria would require more days of protection than the Roe Island criteria,
the upstream location means that the water supply impacts would be less than for the Roe Island criteria in years when
the Roe Island criteria would have applied. It is likely that a shift of the downstream requirement from Roe Island
to Middle Ground would have higher water supply impacts on average but lower impacts in particular years. At the same
time, however, this shift in the downstream location would mean that the criteria would no longer be directly tied
to salinities in San Pablo Bay that have been identified as biologically important for starry flounder, longfin smelt,
and the shrimp, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crangon franciscorum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Several participants in the State Board hearings stressed the importance of avoiding consecutive years of poor
habitat conditions for short-lived species, such as Delta smelt and longfin smelt. For example, Dr. Moyle recommended
that relaxations of the Roe Island standards to Chipps Island during dry and critical years be limited to two consecutive
years. Similarly, during the course of the Agency's discussions with USFWS and NMFS about the potential effects of
these proposed criteria on threatened and endangered species, a question was raised about whether the proposed criteria
would adequately protect the listed Delta smelt in an extended drought. Recent extended droughts in the Bay/Delta
watershed have lasted six or seven years, but there is scientific evidence that droughts as long as fifty years have
occurred and could happen again. Although droughts of this magnitude are unlikely, such a drought would have serious
adverse impacts on the estuary's fisheries resources, and especially on fishes with short life cycles such as the
Delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, water project operators have suggested that extended droughts impose special constraints on project
operations and deliveries, and have recommended that EPA propose relaxations of the Estuarine Habitat criteria
during extended droughts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comments on whether it is necessary to promulgate special criteria to deal with the issue of consecutive
dry or critical years or extended drought. EPA is particularly interested in comments on the biological requirements
of threatened and endangered fishes during these periods, and on the operational impacts of special protection measures
during these periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In this proposed rule, EPA is relying on the Estuarine Habitat criteria to protect the tidal wetlands bordering
Suisun Bay. Tidal wetlands provide habitat for diverse marsh, aquatic and wildlife species, as well as special status
species such as the Suisun song sparrow, Delta tule pea, black rail, clapper rail and soft-haired bird's beak. EPA's
proposed criteria have been developed to protect aquatic species and to provide salinity conditions similar to those
in the late 1960's to early 1970's. Therefore, many of the aquatic species that inhabit the marsh channels should be
better protected under our proposed criteria. In addition, the proposed Estuarine Habitat criteria are designed
to provide substantially better dry and critically dry year springtime conditions than the recent year conditions
that have caused adverse effects on the tidal marsh communities bordering Suisun Bay. EPA therefore believes that
these criteria will provide substantially better conditions in the marshes, but is soliciting comment as to whether
additional criteria are necessary to fully protect the marsh resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA does not believe that there is a sufficient scientific record at this time to establish specific numerical
salinity criteria for the tidal wetlands, it may be possible to set narrative criteria which could be developed into
numerical criteria in the near future as additional information becomes available. To be consistent with EPA guidance,
such narrative criteria should include specific language about conditions that must exist to protect a designated
use, and must be quantifiable so that numeric standards can be developed (USEPA, 1990). Examples of possible narrative
criteria for the Suisun Marsh are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``Water quality conditions sufficient to support high plant diversity and diverse wildlife habitat throughout
all elevations of the tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``Water quality conditions sufficient to assure survival and growth of brackish marsh plants dependent on soils
low in salt content (especially Scirpus californicus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scirpus acutus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in sufficient numbers to support Suisun song sparrow habitat in shoreline marshes and interior marsh channel margins
bordering Suisun Bay.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA welcomes any information or recommendations on criteria to protect the Suisun Bay tidal marshes.

9. USFWS and NMFS have expressed concern that special measures may be necessary to protect Delta smelt in the event
of a late spawn. In particular, these agencies have suggested that if real-time monitoring indicates that peak Delta
smelt spawning occurs in late June or July, it might be appropriate to maintain the 2 ppt isohaline in Suisun Bay during
those months to assure that juveniles remain in the suitable rearing habitat in eastern Suisun Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comment as to whether and how these measures should be incorporated into water quality criteria,
and on the operational impacts of such criteria. In addition, EPA requests comment on how implementation of these
criteria would affect carryover storage requirements presently imposed on water projects for the benefit of the
threatened winter-run Chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. EPA is proposing salmon smolt survival criteria to protect the Cold Fresh-Water Habitat and Fish Migration designated
uses. These criteria would address EPA's concerns with certain temperature criteria contained in the 1991 Bay/Delta
Plan that were disapproved by EPA. As explained in more detail above, the Agency believes that it presently has an inadequate
basis to propose temperature criteria. Further, the adoption of salmon smolt criteria provides the State with more
flexibility in determining an implementation plan protecting the fisheries use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comment as to whether an adequate scientific basis exists to propose a temperature criteria alone.
The Agency is especially interested in receiving comment as to whether a temperature criteria would provide better
protection for the designated uses than the proposed criteria, and whether a temperature criteria could be implemented
given the present operational flexibility in the estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. EPA welcomes any additional information on the effectiveness and feasibility of installing a barrier to fish
(including a sound barrier) at the head of Georgiana Slough. Results from USFWS coded-wire salmon smolt experiments
clearly demonstrate that migrating smolts survive poorly in the central Delta, and salmon smolt survival would be
higher if fish migrated down the main Sacramento River channel. Closure of Georgiana Slough is one of the implementation
measures that the Delta Team of the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee evaluated and recommended as a measure to
increase salmon smolt survival, and survival indices recommended by the fisheries agencies included this measure.
The major concerns over Georgiana Slough closure are: exacerbation of the reverse flow situation in the lower San
Joaquin River, degradation of water quality conditions in the Central Delta, and blocking of upstream migration
of adult salmon. It is likely that reverse flows would become less of a problem with a barrier in place in Georgiana Slough
if exports were balanced with San Joaquin River flows to continue to provide positive flows in the lower San Joaquin.
EPA would like more information on whether a balance could be achieved to provide some periods of time when a Georgiana
Slough barrier would be beneficial for salmon without causing detrimental effects on the other species and habitats
in the Delta. Since EPA's proposed salmon smolt survival index is a criteria to protect the outmigration of smolts,
and Georgiana Slough closure is a measure that would be beneficial for outmigrating salmon, EPA solicits comments
on whether the target index values in its proposal should be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. As explained in more detail above, EPA has based its proposed index values for the salmon smolt survival criteria
for the San Joaquin River on recommendations by the USFWS, NMFS and California DFG at the State Board's Interim Water
Rights Hearings for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. These recommendations include
placing a barrier at the head of Old River during migration of San Joaquin River system smolts through the Delta (April
1 until May 31). The Old River barrier was also recommended by the Delta Team of the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee,
and is one of the projects called for in the CVP Improvement Act. However, discussions with USWFS and NMFS carried out
during EPA's consultations under the ESA have raised questions about whether the barrier would adversely affect
reverse flows in the central Delta under certain conditions. EPA is therefore requesting comment on the following
issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would the proposed salmon smolt criteria index values on the San Joaquin need to be revised if the Old River barrier
is not built? In what ways? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should EPA promulgate alternative or additional criteria that would be effective in the event that the Old River
barrier is not constructed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. In addition to a barrier at the head of Old River, the USFWS implementation recommendations for the San Joaquin
also included certain export limits and flow requirements during peak migration periods. Export limits are also
an important measure for achieving protection for migrating smolts on the Sacramento River system, especially if
there is no barrier in place at Georgiana Slough, and are an element of the models used to generate the salmon smolt survival
indices on the Sacramento River. EPA is concerned that there may be implementation scenarios for the two rivers that
could result in detrimental conditions for migrating smolts even if the proposed index values are achieved. One such
possible scenario may occur if the State Board adopts USFWS implementation recommendations on the Sacramento River
(adjusted, as described above, to account for Georgiana Slough remaining open), but then operates the San Joaquin
River so as to just meet the proposed index values. In this case, our preliminary review indicates that the San Joaquin
River index value theoretically might be attained with lower flows than are protective for the salmon resources.
The USFWS has substantial evidence that San Joaquin River flows are a critical element for successful smolt migration.
Protection of migration for these runs is particularly important considering the low abundances and poor conditions
in the San Joaquin system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion above raises the possibility that the salmon smolt criteria for the San Joaquin River system may need
to be refined. We are therefore requesting comment as to whether the proposed index values should be revised to reflect
the interrelation between Sacramento River and San Joaquin River implementation measures recommended by USFWS.
In particular, should the proposed index values be revised to account for the possible effects of low flow scenarios
on the San Joaquin River?

14. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act requires that measures be taken to double the production of anadromous
fish species throughout the Central Valley watershed. EPA intends that its proposed criteria should support this
goal in the waters of the Bay/Delta estuary. EPA appreciates any information on whether the proposed criteria provide
the necessary protection to reach this goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Dr. Wim Kimmerer has developed a salmon population model for the Sacramento River Basin, CPOP, which includes
a regression model for the Delta based on the same USFWS data used to develop EPA's proposed criteria (BioSystems Analysis,
1989). This model is not divided into reaches, and uses all coded wire tag data from both ocean and trawl recoveries.
Significant independent variables include: proportion of flow remaining in Sacramento River, flow in the Sacramento
River, the interaction between these two, and temperature at Freeport. Dr. Kimmerer compares his analysis with the
USFWS analysis, and reports that his analysis outperforms the USFWS analysis and, in addition, that it better models
temperature effects on mortality. However, this model uses only pre-1989 data. EPA appreciates any comments on the
usefulness of this model in predicting Sacramento River smolt survival and setting criteria to protect Fish Migration
as a designated use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. A number of species in the Bay/Delta estuary appear to rely on estuarine conditions during the months of July to
January. These species include herring (primarily a Bay species), late fall-run salmon, and juvenile striped bass.
EPA welcomes any information on habitat conditions necessary for protection of these species, and on possible revisions
to the proposed criteria that could address these species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. EPA is concerned that changes in water project operations in response to the proposed criteria may have unforeseen
environmental impacts. EPA welcomes comments as to whether there are any operational scenarios for the CVP, SWP,
and/or other water users that would increase or decrease the ecological benefits of the proposed criteria. In addition,
EPA notes that, under the CWA, the state will conduct triennial reviews of these and other water quality criteria to
determine whether they are adequate to protect the designated uses. At those times, the state has the opportunity
to adjust criteria that are shown to be over or under protective of the uses. EPA welcomes comments as to the kinds of
information, such as biological resource monitoring data, that are or will be available to measure the effectiveness
of fish and wildlife criteria in the Bay/Delta.

Aquatic resources of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and upper portions of San Francisco Bay have undergone significant
declines over the past several decades. Species characteristic of the Delta and rivers, such as striped bass and salmon,
began to decline during the late 1970s. Prolonged drought, large diversions of fresh water, and dramatic increases
in populations of introduced aquatic species during the 1980s and 1990s brought a number of indigenous aquatic species
to extremely low levels. Species that spend more of their lives downstream of the Delta, including Delta smelt, longfin
smelt, and many zooplankton, maintained large populations through the 1970s, but declined sharply after the mid-1980s.
Declines in aquatic resources have led to curtailed fishing seasons, to petitions for endangered species status,
and general concern about the health of the estuarine ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern over the impacts of increased salinity produced from the combination of drought and high diversion rates
is not limited to aquatic communities. The few remaining fragments of brackish and freshwater tidal marshlands are
particularly vulnerable to increased salinity or to reduced variability in salinity. Under natural conditions,
these tidal marsh communities would move upstream with the changing salinity. But the flood plains and other lowlands
suitable for the evolution of tidal marshes are absent upstream. Tidal marshes provide important habitat for numerous
plants and animals of special concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large demands for water by the agricultural community and by California's burgeoning urban areas make it difficult
to allocate additional freshwater for the protection of dwindling aquatic and wetland resources of the estuary.
Management of the State's water resources necessitates a delicate balancing of needs, given the intense and growing
competition for water. If the freshwater needs of the estuary are to be considered seriously they must be based on sensitive,
straightforward, and diagnostic indicators of the responses of the estuarine ecosystem to patterns of freshwater
inflow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An extensive body of scientific evidence indicates that flows into, within, and through the estuary are extremely
important to organisms that depend on the estuary for at least a portion of their life cycles. However, the mechanisms
by which flows affect different elements of the ecosystem are not well understood. In the Bay/Delta Estuary, many
chemical and physical properties and processes are tightly linked to flow, including proportion of water diverted,
salinity at a given point, the longitudinal position of a particular salinity range, and alteration of the effects
of toxicants through dilutions. Any of these phenomena could be controlling a particular species, but each will also
vary with the other variables that are closely correlated with flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the complex configuration of the Delta and the estuary, combined with the complex withdrawal and diversion
network, preclude any simple, directly monitored measure of freshwater discharge to the estuary. Effective protection
and management of the estuary requires an index of the estuary's response to freshwater inflow that (1) Can be measured
accurately, easily and inexpensively; (2) has ecological significance; and (3) has meaning for nonspecialists.
Net Delta outflow, which is calculated from various measures and estimates of water inflow and use, has been a useful
tool but it does not satisfy all of these requirements. Because of the high correlations among the flow-related variables,
the choice of a suitable index does not need to be based on any presumed mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Francisco Estuary Project convened a series of technical workshops to evaluate the responses of estuarine
biota and habitats to various conditions of salinity and flow. The workshops involved approximately 30 scientists
and policy makers with expertise in estuarine oceanography and ecology, and in water and living resource management.
The group focused its attention on the Suisun Bay area, the portion of the estuary downstream of the confluence of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and upstream of Carquinez Strait. Internal Delta issues (such as gate closures,
water exports, and internal flows) or problems of downstream portions of the San Francisco Bay (such as urban and industrial
discharges) were not directly addressed by the group. No attempt was made to incorporate all management actions that
might benefit biological communities, nor to identify what level of environmental restoration and protection should
be set based on salinity and flow.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of freshwater needs of aquatic resources has caused conflict for a variety of reasons. Debate of scientific
issues is fundamentally different from other kinds of debate in that it should yield to scientific investigation.
Participants developed issue papers that delineated areas of scientific agreement. Several issue papers showed
that conditions in Suisun Bay largely reflected the abundance, recruitment, or survival not only of local species,
but also of habitat conditions for species upstream and downstream. A primary result of the issue papers produced
for this group was that almost all species studied increased in abundance as a simple function of increased outflow
and decreased salinity. The absence of a plateau or peak in the relationship of species abundances and outflow conditions
means that science alone cannot identify an optimal outflow. Furthermore, the similar response of species at all
ecological (trophic) levels argues strongly that the estuary should be managed using an ecosystem approach rather
than on a species by species basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical workshops concentrated on developing the scientific rationale for an estuarine index to measure the
estuary's response to different levels and patterns of freshwater input. Participants recognized that economic
and socio-political considerations should be accounted for at other points in the deliberations. The needs of society,
as well as the needs of the environment, should be considered in determining appropriate allocations of freshwater.
However, the premise of the workshops was that one should start with the best scientific and technical judgements
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many large-scale changes in the structure of the Delta have been proposed to facilitate water use and to reduce impacts
of water withdrawal on aquatic resources. There was general recognition by the group that the present Delta withdrawal
and distribution system is a major contributor to the declines of important species. The conclusion and recommendations
of the workshops are based upon the present water withdrawal and distribution system and would need to be re-evaluated
if any significant alterations to that system are considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusions and recommendations in this report were developed by the estuarine scientists and managers who participated
in one or more of the workshops. The complete list of participants and their affiliations are listed in Appendix D.
All conclusions and recommendations in this report were reviewed, voted on, and endorsed by a consensus of the estuarine
scientists and managers who participated in the fourth and final workshop in the series (26 August 1992). The term
consensus is used to represent group solidarity on an issue; a judgement arrived at by most of the scientists and managers
present. In all cases, the consensus was unanimous or nearly unanimous. The conclusions and recommendations are
arranged in a sequence that ``tracks'' the evolution of thinking of the participants. The conclusions and recommendations
reached by the group reflect the participants' best scientific and technical judgements, not necessarily the positions
of their affiliated agencies or organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following conclusions and recommendations are intended to provide guidance and information on how estuarine
standards could be developed and how different levels of protection of estuarine resources could be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The full justifications to these conclusions and recommendations are contained in technical papers that accompany
this report and in other documents prepared for the San Francisco Estuary Project. (Appendix E).

(1) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the complex nature of the freshwater delivery and distribution system in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta estuary, there is at present no single, simple, accurate measure of freshwater input to the estuary
that conveys information important to resource managers and to the public, and that is meaningful to those with special
concerns about how fluctuations in freshwater inflow to the estuary affect habitat and the condition of the estuarine
ecosystem.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Estuarine standards should be developed to be used in conjunction with flow standards. One set of standards should
be based upon an index of the physical response of the estuary to fluctuations in the input of fresh water. These standards
should have diagnostic value in providing, throughout the year, a level of protection to the estuary and to important
ecosystem values and functions consistent with environmental goals and objectives for the Bay-Delta estuary.

(2) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Estuarine standards to be used in conjunction with flow standards should be based upon an index that is simple and inexpensive
to measure accurately, that has ecological significance, that integrates a number of important estuarine properties
and processes, and that is meaningful to a large number of constituencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Salinity should be used as an index for the development of some estuarine standards.

Justification

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the first workshop (August 1991), participants identified and assessed a number of indices of the estuary's responses
to flow to use in managing freshwater discharge to the estuary. The preliminary, preworkshop, choice was the position
of the entrapment zone. This index was abandoned quickly, however. The entrapment zone is important to estuarine
ecosystem processes and functions, but at present there is no single, straightforward ``entrapment zone index''
suitable for monitoring the position or strength of the entrapment zone as a function of freshwater input.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity was selected as the most appropriate index because: (1) The salinity distribution is of direct ecological
importance to many species; (2) the salinity distribution is a result of the interplay of freshwater input, geometry
of the estuarine basin, diversion of fresh water in the Delta, and the tidal regime; and (3) salinity measurements
can be made accurately, directly, easily, and economically. Moreover, since most of the major concerns about reductions
in the freshwater input to the estuary are associated either directly or indirectly with the loss or alteration of
low salinity habitat, salinity is an ideal index for keeping track of the extent_both area and volume_of low salinity
habitat. The salinity distribution represents the response of the estuary to different combinations of river discharge,
diversions and withdrawals, tidal regime, and basin geometry.

Because the difference between surface and near-bottom salinities is small and because the relationship between
them is reasonably well known, surface salinity could also be used. Near-bottom salinity is recommended, however,
because it is a more stable indicator.

Justification

(5) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Estuarine systems are characterized not only by short-term responses to the mean salinity at any given location,
but also by responses to longer-term seasonal, annual and interannual variability in salinity and other properties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent advances in scientific understanding indicate that this dynamic character of healthy estuarine ecosystems
is particularly true for the distribution and abundance of wetland vegetation, but also holds for other aquatic organisms.

Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential importance of variations in salinity on different time scales to the structure and dynamics of estuarine
ecosystems should be considered in developing salinity standards. Deviations from the patterns of salinity variability
in the historical data set could increase the risk of not achieving environmental goals and objectives even if mean
positions of the 2

Justification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is strong biological evidence from a number of estuaries throughout the world that variability in flow, in circulation
and mixing, in the salinity distribution, and in the distribution of other important properties and processes is
important in maintaining a healthy estuarine ecosystem. Therefore, variability in flow above the threshold needed
to meet the seasonal salinity standard is encouraged.

(6) Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Empirical statistical relationships were developed between a variety of estuarine properties and resources, and
the position of the near-bottom 2

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The relationships developed are statistical relationships. They are not proof of cause-effect.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The relationships indicate clearly, however, that the position of the near-bottom 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isohaline can serve as a powerful diagnostic indicator of the condition of biological ``units'' (communities, populations)
across a range of different trophic levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the information these relationships can provide, water managers will be in a far better position to regulate
freshwater discharge to the estuarine system to produce, on the average,

 predictable and desirable ecological responses of the estuary consistent with goals selected for the estuarine
ecosystem. If this strategy is followed, the probability of the desired ecological response will be enhanced and
the chances of undesirable ecological surprises in the estuary will be reduced.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The salinity distribution should be monitored continuously at a series of at least six stations spaced approximately
five kilometers apart and located along the channel between about Emmaton and Carquinez Bridge. Measurements should
be made at least near the surface and near the bottom at each station. The data should be telemetered to a convenient
location for timely analysis and interpretation. These continuous monitoring data should be supplemented with
detailed surveys to map the distribution of salinity in three dimensions. The data should be readily available in
a timely way to all interested parties.

During the second and third workshops, and during intersessions between workshops, a systematic search was made

the maximum amount of environmental/ecological information. In every case, the objective was to demonstrate how
these diagnostic environmental/ecological indicators responded to changes in the position of the near-bottom

at least a rudimentary understanding exists for the causal mechanisms underlying many of these relationships. The

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isohaline is important either because it is a direct causal factor or because it is highly correlated with a direct
causal factor (e.g., diversions). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Preliminary analyses show that errors in prediction using models which incorporate only the position of the 2

(8) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of key species are subject not only to the biological effects of the location of the near-bottom 2

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 isohaline, and therefore the effects of freshwater inflow to the estuary, but also to the physical effects of entrainment
and diversion by the various water projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity standards should be keyed to the existing city, county, regional, state, and federal water diversion and
distribution system. Proposed changes to that system should trigger a re-evaluation of the salinity standards to
ensure that they will continue to provide the desired level of environmental protection while retaining as much flexibility
as possible in meeting the state's other needs for water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a broad class of models can be constructed, including mechanistic and statistical models that incorporate
both biological and physical parameters and other factors such as diversions, exports, and antecedent conditions,
efforts should be enhanced to ensure a consistent, long-term accurate measurement program to enhance these models
and to decrease the uncertainties in their application. The ultimate goal is to have a predictive model that incorporates
the position of the 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(9) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity standards should be based upon the best scientific and technical knowledge. A method is needed to summarize
and to advance the state of scientific and technical knowledge of the complex relationships between variations in
the position of the near-bottom 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

 isohaline during different periods of the year (and associated Delta outflow) and a variety of diagnostic ecosystem
responses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity and flow-response matrices should be developed for different biologically important periods of the year.
The matrices should summarize the existing state of knowledge of the responses of a rich variety of estuarine organisms
and communities as well as estuarine properties and processes, to the location of the near-bottom 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
U
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isohaline and associated freshwater discharge to the estuary. The estuarine properties and biological responses
initially identified for inclusion in these matrices are summarized in Exhibit A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Matrix Manager should be appointed to oversee the development of the summary matrices and to ensure quality control.
The Matrix Manager should orchestrate the analyses of relevant data and ensure that the results of the analyses are
cast into forms appropriate for the intended uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because estuarine habitat suitability and, therefore, estuarine ecosystem health are not simply a function of the
instantaneous salinity distribution, the entry in each response cell of the matrix, whenever possible, should be
based upon the development of functional relationships of estuarine properties to isohaline positions (and freshwater
input to the estuary) that incorporate lagged terms, seasonal variability, and other water management variables.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ideally, the input to each matrix cell would include a directory of the appropriate model, or models, that could be
used for prediction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed matrices are shorthand methods for keeping track of advances in the state of scientific knowledge and
for ensuring that the most up-to-date scientific knowledge is used in decision-making. They are not intended to be
used as isolated regulatory tools. They are a summary of the state of development of those tools, a guide to which tools
to use during different times of the year, and an index of where to find them. The responsibility for development of
the matrices and for periodically updating them should be institutionalized. One appropriate agency might be the
Interagency Ecological Studies Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Justification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed matrices are an effective shorthand way of summarizing in a convenient format the status of a large amount
of data and information relating the responses of the estuary to fluctuations in freshwater inflow and to other water
management variables. The matrices are a useful vehicle for summarizing the biological benefits_using a broad array
of response indicators_of positioning the near-bottom 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
U
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 salinity isohaline at various distances upstream (inland) from the Golden Gate Bridge during different periods
of the year. The proposed matrices would provide the first quantitative and comprehensive summary of how the San Francisco
Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta estuary ecosystem responds to fluctuations in freshwater inflow to the estuary
(Delta outflow) and to the estuary's changing salinity regime. The matrices have further advantages. They will provide
managers, policy-makers and the public with: (1) a clear statement by the scientific community of the current status
of understanding of the effects of different freshwater discharge-diversion scenarios on the estuarine ecosystem;
(2) an identification of critical gaps in scientific knowledge that can be used to guide future research and monitoring
activities; and (3) a summary that is easily updated on a cell-by-cell basis as new knowledge is developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The models upon which the matrices are based can serve as tools for regulatory agencies to use in incorporating the
environmental needs of the estuary into a set of management prescriptions for storing, releasing, and diverting
water for consumptive uses. Section of the level or degree of biological response to be achieved_the level of environmental
protection_is the responsibility of regulatory bodies acting in response to society's priorities.

Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Goals should be expressed in terms of desired conditions for some future time. Progress toward those goals should
be monitored and reported widely. Environmental goals for the estuary will be most effective if they are expressed
in terms of restoring conditions to those that existed at specific historical times such as those summarized in Exhibit
B.

 isohaline, the biological resources of the low salinity portion of the estuary, including the Delta, have been seriously
depleted. Data from the Interagency Ecological Studies Program and the University of California at Davis indicate
clearly that species at every trophic level are now at, or near, record low levels in the Delta and in Suisun Bay. This
is not surprising considering the recent drought, the introduction of exotic species, and the increased diversion
of water.

be examined to determine how frequently these conditions would have been met before construction of the Central Valley
Project; the State Water Project; a variety of city, county, and regional projects that divert water; and before the
large-scale reclamation of historical tidal marshlands. The results of these analyses would provide a valuable
context within which to evaluate the amounts of water needs to achieve a range of ecological goals.

1. Calculating Delta Outflow Over Historical Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Net Delta outflow at Chipps Island is estimated by performing a water balance at the boundary of the Delta. The water
balance involves adding the total Delta inflow and Delta precipitation runoff, then subtracting Delta channel depletions
and exports. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Equation 1, below. DWR has estimated net Delta outflow for water years 1956&hyph;present with their flow accounting
model, DAYFLOW. A similar model, using a smaller number of measured flows, was used to estimate Delta outflow from
1929&hyph;1962. In the years of overlap the two models yield very similar results.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The four components used to calculate net Delta outflow are based on a variety of measurements. Most of the river inflows
are gaged or directly measured at some point before they enter the Delta. Local precipitation is derived by multiplying
the surface area of the Delta by the rainfall recorded at Stockton. Local precipitation is usually a trivial amount
of flow but within-Delta uses (called channel depletions) can be substantial. Prior to construction of Shasta Dam
and its regulation of Sacramento River flow, net Delta outflow was often negative during summer months because channel
depletions exceeded Delta outflow. The level of channel depletions in DAYFLOW are based on average monthly crop demands
for the acreage of each crop grown on Delta islands. Exports are directly measured at the point of diversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the arithmetic nature of these estimates of Delta outflow, the estimated flows cannot reflect the impacts
of such factors as the spring/neap tidal cycles, wind, etc. that would affect the actual mean daily flow velocities
in the western Delta.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The daily estimates of net Delta outflow from October 1, 1939 to September 30, 1975 were used to calculate the frequency
with which the 2 ppt isohaline was downstream of each of the specified positions in each year. Isohaline position is
a function of net Delta outflow on a particular day and the isohaline position on the previous day, as specified in Eq.
2. (Kimmerer and Monismith 1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed criteria were developed to reflect the average position of the 2 ppt isohaline in different water year
types, according to the classification adopted by the State Board (SWRCB 1991). First, for each year from 1940 to 1975,
the number of days on which the 2 ppt level was attained at each target location was tabulated. These totals were then
averaged across each water year type. Because no critical years were available for comparison during this historical
period, the average position of the 2 ppt isohaline in critical years was extrapolated from the other year types. The
extrapolation was performed by fitting a curvilinear model to the averages for the other year types. These extrapolations
are shown in Figures 1 and 2, above. The results of average number of days for each year type, along with the extrapolated
values for critical years, are presented in Table 1, above.

4. Sensitivity to Starting Assumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No estimate of the location of the 2 ppt isohaline on October 1, 1939 was available, so the starting position in October
1939 was assumed to be 75 km. However, sensitivity analysis showed that the calculated isohaline position on February
1 was largely independent of the assumed isohaline position on the preceding October 1. This sensitivity analysis
was performed as follows: for each of the ten years from 1940 to 1949, the February 1 isohaline position was calculated
under two assumptions: (1) that the October 1 starting position was at the Golden Gate (km 0), and (2) that the October
1 starting position was 100 km upstream of the Golden Gate. The historical delta outflow patterns and volumes differed
greatly among these years and the calculated February 1 isohaline positions ranged from 49 km above the Golden Gate
after wet winters to as much as 72 km above the Golden Gate during dry winters. However, by February 1 the difference
in calculated positions based on the two different starting positions varied by no more than 0.1 km in any year.

and San Joaquin Rivers. These indices and the underlying models represent the state-of-the-art analyses of the factors
critical to maintaining habitat conditions necessary to protect cold water fish migration. Nevertheless, as further
scientific work is completed and the new data is analyzed in the models, EPA anticipates that the models and indices
will be further refined. EPA intends that these refinements be incorporated into the State's criteria during the
triennial review process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The smolt survival index for fall-run outmigrating smolts in the Sacramento River Delta has been developed by the
US Fish and Wildlife Service, using coded-wire tagged hatchery-raised smolts released at various locations and
under different conditions within the Bay/Delta, and recovered by trawl downstream. The methods are described in
USFWS, 1987. Since estimates of total tagged fish in the river cross-section (based on trawl mouth size and time fished)
yielded a maximum survival index of nearly 1.8, and the frequency distribution plot of survival indices indicated
an approximately normal distribution with a median near 1.0, the indices were divided by 1.8 to provide biologically
meaningful survival rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to estimate the benefits of various measures to achieve these indices, a multiple regression smolt survival
model was developed for the Sacramento River portion of the Delta. The model, based on tagged smolt releases between
1978 and 1989, is described in Kjelson et al, 1989; a more recent verification and analysis is described in USFWS, 1992a
and 1992b. The Sacramento River portion of the Delta was divided into three reaches for survival analysis: (1) The
Sacramento River from Sacramento to Walnut Grove, where the Cross-Delta Channel and Georgiana Slough divert water
from the main-stem Sacramento River into the central Delta; (2) Walnut Grove to Chipps Island (at the confluence of
the Delta river systems) via the central Delta; and (3) Walnut Grove to Chipps Island via the Sacramento River system.
Survival indices were converted to mortalities by subtracting from 1.0, and were correlated with ecologically meaningful
factors for each reach. Multiple regression analysis was then used to develop equations for each reach which included
the significant (p&lt;.05) factors affecting mortality. The equations used to calculate mortality for each reach
(as identified above) are:

The USFWS is also estimating survival from recovery of tagged fish in the ocean salmon fishery. The results correlate
with the (unadjusted) trawl recovery survival indices (p&lt;0.01; r=0.89; USFWS 1992b), and further increase confidence
in the survival indices as a good measure of migration success and habitat conditions.

Sacramento River Delta survival index values reflecting historical habitat conditions in different types of water
years (Table 2) were calculated by the USFWS using the 1989 version of the above models, together with historical data
on temperatures, water exports, and the percentage of Sacramento River flows diverted at Walnut Grove, as described
in USFWS 1992a. All total survival values are calculated as monthly averages, and assume, based on past sampling results,
that 17% migrate through the Delta from the Sacramento River in April, 65% in May, and 18% in June. At low temperatures,
the Sacramento River regression gives mortality values (m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of less than zero, indicating that the regression does not give biologically meaningful results at these lower temperatures.
The USFWS transforms these negative values to zeros before calculating total survival.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The smolt survival indices for the San Joaquin River Delta were developed from coded-wire tagged smolt study results
(USFWS 1992b). The CWT experiments were specifically designed to evaluate the benefit of constructing a barrier
at the head of the Old River Channel to keep smolts in the main channel of the San Joaquin River. Smolts diverted into
the Old River Channel are on a direct path to the State and Federal pumping plants, and are also likely subject to high
temperatures and increased predation. The smolt survival relationship for smolts kept in the San Joaquin River is:

There was evidence from the individual CWT studies that water exports had a substantial effect on survival for those
smolts migrating down the San Joaquin to Suisun Bay. For instance, separate releases in 1989 under high export conditions
and low export conditions indicate approximately double the survival under low export conditions. Although adding
exports to the regression equation did not improve it, probably because there are not enough experimental releases
under enough variety of conditions to provide a significant relationship, the USFWS developed an additional equation
to model this factor, and used both this equation and the above flow equation to estimate smolt survival indices for
the San Joaquin River. A discussion of the methodology is provided in USFWS 1992a and 1992b. This additional relationship
is:

Past adult escapement data was used to estimate smolt survival for historical conditions because there is still not
enough CWT information under a broad enough variety of flow and export conditions to rely solely on CWT study results.
Escapement values on the Y axis were replaced with survival values from 0 to 1.0. This assumes that adult production
is an indicator of smolt survival. This assumption is generally valid, because less of the overall natural mortality
occurs after the smolts enter the ocean. The relationship is as follows:

The USFWS used this relationship to estimate historical smolt survival indices for various periods of time (see Table

relationship between flow at Stockton and survival through the lower San Joaquin River (USFWS 1992a).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) revises its proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hypomesus transpacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) originally published on October 3, 1991, concurrently with the proposal to list the species, pursuant to the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was published
on March 5, 1993. In the final rule, the Service postponed the decision on critical habitat determination for up to
1 year beyond the date that the final rule was due (October 3, 1993) in accordance with section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the
Act. The Service has refined the primary constituent elements described in the original critical habitat proposal.
This revised proposed rule supersedes all aspects of the Service's previous proposal. Critical habitat designation
for the delta smelt would provide additional protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require
Federal agency action. As required by section 4 of the Act, the Service will consider economic and other relevant impacts
prior to making a final decision on the size and configuration of critical habitat. The Service solicits data and comments
from the public on all aspects of this revised proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the January 6, 1989 (50 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate
species. Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession are sufficient to support proposals
for listing. On June 29, 1990, the Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman, President-Elect
of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species
with critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that substantial information had been presented indicating
that the petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta
smelt as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition
finding in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire
water column bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length
of Montezuma Slough, portions of the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, portions of
the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically
less than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication
of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service published a notice of public hearing on the proposed rule on December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877). Public hearings
were conducted in California on January 9, 1992, in Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January
16, 1992, in Visalia. At each meeting, testimony was taken from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was published on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854). In the final
rule, the Service postponed the decision on critical habitat designation for up to 1 year beyond the date that the final
rule was due (October 3, 1993) in accordance with section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act. The economic analysis necessary
to determine critical habitat was still in progress at that time. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published
a notice that the public comment period on the proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was reopened
until April 30, 1993, to allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not been submitted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is required to base critical habitat designations on the best scientific and commercial data available
(50 CFR 424.12). Subsequent to publication of the October 3, 1991, proposed rule, the Service received new information
on the current distribution of the delta smelt, primarily from other State and Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based primarily on information gathered by the California Department of Fish and Game (Dale Sweetnam, California
Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993) and University of California, Davis (Lesa Meng, University of California,
pers. comm., 1993), the Service proposes to expand the geographic extent of critical habitat to include additional
areas now known to constitute important spawning habitat. In 1993, delta smelt spawned in the Sacramento River, at
least as far upstream as Sacramento and Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs
(Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). In 1991, when delta smelt had all but disappeared from Suisun Marsh, relatively
large numbers of delta smelt were caught in Suisun Slough, as far upstream as Suisun City (Lesa Meng, pers. comm., 1993).
For these reasons, the proposed critical habitat has been revised to encompass these upstream habitats. Protection
of these upstream spawning habitats is essential to ensure recovery of the species. Hence, this rule proposes critical
habitat for the following geographic area: Areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and
the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays);
the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma Sloughs; and the existing contiguous
waters contained within the Delta. As used in this rule, the term ``Delta'' refers to all tidal waters contained within
the legal definition of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, as delineated by section 12220 of the State of California's
Water Code of 1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an April 23, 1993, letter, received during the public comment period, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
requested that new scientific information presented in its draft proposed Bay/Delta water quality standards be
considered in the Service's designation of critical habitat. The Service has used this information to refine the
primary constituent elements described in the original critical habitat proposal. (The term ``primary constituent
element'' is defined in the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section of this rule.) The Service's original proposal
listed the following constituent elements: Space for population growth, cover or shelter, maintenance of appropriate
littoral zone reproduction habitat to sustain embryos and to rear larvae and juveniles, and 0&hyph;2 parts per thousand
(ppt) salinities during the January to June delta smelt reproductive season. As part of the background for formulation
of its proposed water quality standards, EPA analyzed the number of days that low salinity (2 ppt) water historically
was located at three positions in Suisun Bay. The revised primary constituent elements incorporate this new information.
As described in the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section of this rule, the Service has revised the primary constituent
elements to include those features that provide temporal and spatial variability of low salinity waters that will
deter further invasion of exotic species, produce high zooplankton densities for food, and simulate natural processes
and historical conditions. The primary constituent elements also describe in detail the months that each delta smelt
life stage requires protective habitat conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the information presented by EPA, the Service has determined that, if implemented, EPA's proposed
water quality standards would likely significantly affect critical habitat as proposed in the October 3, 1991, rule.
Consequently, the Service is proposing this revised rule to reduce the potential for inconsistencies between EPA's
standards and the Service's proposed critical habitat. Resolving the inconsistencies will afford the smelt the
same or better protection as would have been achieved through the earlier proposal.

Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act as written do not specify how government actions should be coordinated
or agency conflicts should be resolved. However, because the Service and EPA recognize that their proposed regulatory
actions overlap both biologically and economically, both agencies are working closely to provide a comprehensive,
ecosystem-based approach to the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta Estuary. This coordination should also provide a set of regulatory actions that are integrated in both
substance and timing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires that all Federal agencies ensure that their actions do not jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or adversely modify listed species' critical habitat. EPA's proposed
action to designate water quality standards must comply with the section 7 requirement. EPA has initiated a formal
consultation process under section 7. Additionally, the Clean Water Act requires protection of the most sensitive
use within each category of designated uses. Protection of endangered and threatened species is considered a designated
use within the meaning of the Clean Water Act; therefore, a species listing under the Endangered Species Act provides
one method to identify the most sensitive use within the designated uses of a water body. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biologically, the proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt and the salinity criteria that constitute EPA's
proposed water quality standards are directly related. Specifically, the occurrence of salinities of 2 parts per
thousand (ppt) in Suisun Bay was identified as a critical habitat primary constituent element in the October 3, 1991,
critical habitat proposal. Subsequent scientific publications indicate that salinities associated with the distribution
of delta smelt may provide the best basis for setting standards for many species that are affected by freshwater discharge
from the Bay/Delta Estuary. Favorable conditions from February through June are extremely important to the abundance
and reproductive success of almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper Bay/Delta Estuary. EPA's
proposed water quality standards address the location of 2 ppt salinities from February to June and, therefore, address
both critical habitat requirements for delta smelt and a range of interrelated parameters that affect other species
that rely on estuarine habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, the delta smelt is thought to have occurred from Suisun Bay upstream to the city of Sacramento on the
Sacramento River and Mossdale on the San Joaquin River (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). Recently, however, Wang (1991) recorded larval delta smelt from the Sacramento River as far north as its confluence
with the Feather River. The delta smelt is an euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range) that spawns in
fresh water and has been collected from estuarine waters up to 14 grams per liter (ppt) salinity (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). For a large part of its annual life span, this species is associated with the freshwater edge of the entrapment
zone (mixing zone at the saltwater-freshwater interface), where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966,
Moyle

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where
salinity varies spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of freshwater inflow. (The term
estuary refers to a partially enclosed water body of variable salinity with freshwater and seawater inflow.) Despite
this tremendously variable environment, the historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable
habitat conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with the entrapment zone (Peter Moyle,
University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Since the 1850s, however, the amount and extent of suitable habitat
for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in 1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin
Rivers led to increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the Estuary (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked
the beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment,
upstream or reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and constriction of habitat in the less productive,
deep-water river channels of the Delta (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). These adverse conditions are primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water diverted from
the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central
Valley Project began in water year 1940. The State Water Project began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion
of fresh water being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels (Moyle et al. 1992). The high
proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh environmental conditions experienced by the
delta smelt during the recent 6-year drought. The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854), final rule listing the delta smelt as
a threatened species describes in detail the factors that have led to this species' decline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt focuses on habitat conditions required
during specific life stages (spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult migration) of this annual
species to ensure its eventual recovery. Shortly before spawning, adult delta smelt migrate upstream from the highly
productive brackish-water habitat associated with the entrapment zone to disperse widely into river channels and
tidally-influenced backwater sloughs (Radtke 1966, Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). Migrating adults with nearly mature
eggs have been taken at the Central Valley Project's Tracy Pumping Plant from late December 1990 to April 1991 (Wang
1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt spawn in shallow, fresh or slightly brackish water upstream of the entrapment zone (Wang 1991). Most spawning
occurs in tidally-influenced backwater sloughs and channel edgewaters (Moyle 1976; Wang 1986, 1991; Moyle et al.
1992). Although delta smelt spawning behavior has not been observed (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992), the adhesive, demersal eggs are thought to attach to substrates such as cattails and tules, tree roots, and
submerged branches (Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). In the Delta, spawning is known to occur in the Sacramento River and in
Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs (Wang 1991; Dale Sweetnam, pers.
comm., 1993). Delta smelt also spawn north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun Sloughs and their tributaries (Dale
Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993; Lesa Meng, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spawning season varies from year to year and may occur from late winter (December) to early summer (July). Moyle
(1976) collected gravid adults from December to April, although ripe delta smelt were most common in February and
March. In 1989 and 1990, Wang (1991) estimated that spawning had taken place from mid-February to late June or early
July, with the peak spawning period occurring in late April and early May. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on data for a closely related species, delta smelt eggs probably hatch in 12 to 14 days (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). After hatching, larvae are transported downstream toward the entrapment zone where they are retained by the
vertical circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). The pelagic larvae and juveniles feed on zooplankton. When the entrapment zone is located in a broad geographic
area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of
phytoplankton and zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval and juvenile fish, including
delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). In general, estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman
and Horne 1983). Estuarine environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food and shallow, protective
habitat for young.

When the entrapment zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large
expanse of shallow-water and marsh habitat. Dispersion in areas downstream from the State and Federal water pumps
and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive,
protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In contrast, when located upstream, the entrapment
zone becomes confined in the deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain fewer shoal areas,
have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack high zooplankton productivity.

 (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers,
in July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of Fish and Game, California Department of Water
Resources, and Bureau of Reclamation, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island in Suisun Bay
north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang
1991). These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution
surveys, Wang (1991) was able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to Suisun Bay in late June
and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991).

Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied
by the species *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation
of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas
outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed *&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination
*&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation,''
as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``*&blank;*&blank;* to use and the use of all methods and procedures which
are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant
to this Act are no longer necessary.'' Therefore, areas designated as critical habitat must contain those physical
or biological features essential to recover a species to the point that it no longer requires protection under the
Act. Hence, critical habitat designation affords species additional protection above and beyond those of listing
in that it preserves options for the species' eventual recovery. Section 3 further states that in most cases the entire
range of a species should not be encompassed within critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat designations alert Federal and State agencies, other organizations, and the public about the importance
of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical habitat also identifies areas that may require special
management or protection. Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions
carried out, funded, or authorized by Federal agencies. Section 7 requires that Federal agencies consult on actions
that may affect critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical
habitat. Section 7 also requires Federal agencies to confer on Federal actions that are likely to result in adverse
modification or destruction of proposed critical habitat. Aside from the added protection provided under section
7, the Act does not provide other direct forms of protection to lands designated as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to considering biological information in designating critical habitat, the Service also considers
economic and other relevant impacts of designating critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical
habitat when the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical habitat,
provided that the exclusion will not result in the extinction of a species.

In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological
features that are essential to a species' conservation (50 CFR 424.12). The Service is required to list the known primary
constituent elements together with a description of any critical habitat that is proposed. Such physical and biological
features (i.e., primary constituent elements) include, but are not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;

Following are the primary constituent elements necessary to conserve the delta smelt. These elements were determined
in coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality standards. EPA's proposed rule to promulgate
Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta
of the State of California is published in this same

 separate part. In its proposed rule, EPA has requested specific comments on several issues, including the possibility
of modifying the Sacramento River Index for the purposes of developing the salinity criteria, alternative approaches
to the averaging period used in its proposed salinity criteria, and evaluation of the merits of the use of difference
forms of confidence intervals with the proposed criteria. The Fish and Wildlife Service will consider these comments
also in developing its final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements are organized by habitat conditions required for each life stage. The specific
geographic areas and seasons identified for each habitat condition specified below represent the maximum possible
range of each of these variables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the habitat conditions specified below requires as its basis placement of the 2 ppt isohaline at or downstream
of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence from February through June. (An isohaline is a line that can be drawn
to connect all points of equal salinity.) Furthermore, the location of the 2 ppt isohaline must vary according to water
years because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporal and spatial variability of the 2 ppt isohaline will be the most effective deterrent to further invasion
of new introduced species and continued competition by those that are already established,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Placement of the 2 ppt isohaline in an area will also produce the high phytoplankton and zooplankton densities
that characterize most healthy estuarine ecosystems, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Variability is needed to simulate natural processes and historical conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 lists the number of days (based on a 14-day running average) that the 2 ppt isohaline must be located at Roe Island,
Chipps Island, or the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence during wet, above normal, below normal, dry, and critically
dry years to achieve the life-stage habitat conditions described below. These required salinity criteria are based
on historical records of the water years between October 1939 (subsequent to the operation of the Federal and State
water projects) and September 1975 (prior to the decline of the delta smelt) (Harry Seraydarian, EPA,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993; Bruce Herbold, EPA, pers. comm., 1993). However, because no critically dry years occurred during this period,
the salinity criteria (required number of days) for these years are based on an extrapolation of the data.

The Roe Island salinity criteria are meant to replicate natural spring storm cycles and are invoked only after uncontrolled
runoff has placed the 2 ppt isohaline seaward of Roe Island. Therefore, the criteria for Roe Island represent the maximum
number of days that the 2 ppt isohaline must be located there.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spawning Habitat_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delta smelt adults seek shallow, tidally-influenced, freshwater (i.e., less than 2 ppt salinity) backwater sloughs
and edgewaters for spawning. To ensure egg hatching and larval viability, spawning areas also must provide suitable
water quality (i.e., low concentrations of pollutants) and substrates for egg attachment (e.g., submerged tree
roots and branches and emergent vegetation). Specific areas that have been identified as important delta smelt spawning
habitat include Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Prospect, Georgiana, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs and the Sacramento
River in the Delta, and tributaries of northern Suisun Bay. The spawning season varies from year to year and may start
as early as December and extend until July. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Larval and Juvenile Transport_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that delta smelt larvae are transported from the area where they are hatched to shallow, productive rearing
or nursery habitat, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributary channels must be protected from physical
disturbance (e.g., sand and gravel mining, diking, dredging, and levee or bank protection and maintenance) and flow
disruption (e.g., water diversions that result in entrainment and in-channel barriers or tidal gates). Adequate
river flow is necessary to transport larvae to rearing habitat in Suisun Bay. To ensure that suitable rearing habitat
is available in Suisun Bay, the salinity criteria described above in Table 1 are required. Reverse flows that maintain
larvae upstream in deep-channel regions of low productivity and expose them to entrainment interfere with these
transport requirements. Suitable water quality must be provided so that maturation is not impaired by pollutant
concentrations. The specific geographic area important for larval transport is confined to waters contained within
the legal boundary of the Delta, Suisun Bay, and Montezuma Slough and its tributaries. The specific season when habitat
conditions identified above are important for successful larval transport varies from year to year depending on
when peak spawning occurs. Therefore, habitat conditions suitable for transport of larvae and juveniles may be required
as early as February 1 and as late as August 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rearing Habitat_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance of the 2 ppt isohaline (according to the salinity criteria described in Table 1) and suitable water quality
(low concentrations of pollutants) within the Estuary is necessary to provide delta smelt larvae and juveniles a
shallow, protective, food-rich environment in which to mature to adulthood. This placement of the 2 ppt isohaline
also serves to protect larval, juvenile, and adult delta smelt from entrainment in the State and Federal water projects.
However, additional flows above those required to implement the February through June salinity criteria listed
in Table 1 may be required occasionally to protect larval and juvenile delta smelt from being entrained in the State
and Federal water projects during the months of July and August. These additional flows will be required when the previous
year's abundance indices show that the adult population already is at low levels and late spawning conditions have
led to distribution of larval and juvenile delta smelt upstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
Rivers in July and August. An area extending eastward from Carquinez Straits, including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay,
Honker Bay, Montezuma Slough and its tributary sloughs, up the Sacramento River to its confluence with Three Mile
Slough, and south along the San Joaquin River including Big Break, defines the specific geographic area critical
to the maintenance of suitable rearing habitat. Three Mile Slough represents the approximate location of the most
upstream extent of tidal excursion when the salinity criteria described in Table 1 are implemented. Protection of
rearing habitat conditions may be required from the beginning of February to the end of August.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adult Migration_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adult delta smelt must be provided unrestrained access to suitable spawning habitat in a period that may extend from
December to July. Therefore, adequate flow and suitable water quality must be maintained to attract migrating adults
in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River channels and their associated tributaries, including Cache and Montezuma
Sloughs and their tributaries. These areas also must be protected from physical disturbance and flow disruption
during migratory periods.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To conserve the delta smelt, critical habitat is proposed for an area encompassing the specific habitat conditions
required by each life stage identified above. Accordingly, critical habitat is proposed for the following geographic
area: Areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and
contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff,
First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma Sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta.
The proposed critical habitat is contained within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, and Yolo Counties,
California. The ``Proposed Regulations Promulgation'' section provides a precise metes and bounds description
of the revised proposed critical habitat.

Effects of Critical Habitat Designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that the activities they authorize, fund, or carry
out are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility is in addition to
the requirement in the same section of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued
existence of any listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both
the survival and recovery of a listed species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined
at 50 CFR 404.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both
the survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly state that such alterations include,
but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the
basis for determining the habitat to be critical. The requirement to consider potential adverse modification of
critical habitat is an incremental consideration above and beyond the review necessary to evaluate the likelihood
of jeopardy and incidental take in section 7 consultations. In section 7 consultations, the Service considers the
potential for adverse modification of the primary constituent elements identified in the critical habitat designation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat a brief
description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may
be affected by such designation. The Service has identified the following list of activities that, depending on the
season of construction and scale of the project, may result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat without necessarily jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sand and gravel extraction in river channels or marshes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement
of dredged materials on levees of banks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Bridge and marina construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction and implementation of each of these actions requires authorization by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant
to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Based on the Service's review
of all existing or proposed projects that may affect the delta smelt, the great majority that would likely result in
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat also would be likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the species. The Service has not identified any proposed actions that might jeopardize the delta smelt without
adversely affecting its critical habitat.

Considerations of Economic and Other Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any
particular area to be included within the critical habitat boundary. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical
habitat should it be determined that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such an area
as part of the critical habitat unless it is determined, based on the best scientific and commercial data available,
that the failure to designate such an area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impacts of designating critical habitat are in addition to the economic and other impacts attributable to listing
of the species. Impacts attributable to listing include those resulting from the taking prohibitions under section
9 of the Act and associated regulations. ``Take,'' as defined in section 3(18) of the Act, includes harm to a listed
species. ``Harm'' means an act that actually kills or injures wildlife. Such an act may include significant habitat
modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral
patterns, including feeding, breeding, or sheltering (50 CFR 17.3).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Impacts attributable to listing also include those resulting from the responsibility of Federal agencies under
section 7 to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened
species. An action could be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species through the destruction
or modification of its habitat regardless of whether that habitat has been formally designated as critical. The Act
provides significant protection to species, including protection to their habitats, as a result of listing. Therefore,
the direct economic and other impacts resulting from additional habitat protection through critical habitat designation
may be incrementally small. In general, the designation of critical habitat supplements the substantive protection
resulting from listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has prepared a draft Regulatory Impact Analysis on its proposed water quality standards. EPA's draft Regulatory
Impact Analysis includes an economic analysis of the effects of the designation of critical habitat for the delta
smelt. This economic analysis concludes that economic costs attributable to the designation of critical habitat
for the delta smelt are relatively small and due primarily to the effects designation of critical habitat would have
upon the five types of actions listed above under the section entitled ``Effects of Critical Habitat Designation.''
An underlying assumption of the draft economic analysis is that the costs associated with implementing EPA's proposed
water quality standards for the Bay/Delta are due primarily to listing the delta smelt as threatened. As the Service
refines its economic analysis, it may determine that this assumption is to some degree inappropriate and that some
of the costs associated with implementing the water quality standards may be attributable to the designation of critical
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with sand and gravel operations (approximately two aggregate operators are located in the Delta),
diking or dredging for agricultural activities, and marina or bridge construction are expected to be similar. Project
proponents or operators would incur costs associated with wetlands restoration, using a replacement ratio of 3 acres
restored for 1 acre destroyed. The cost to restore 1 acre of wetlands ranges between $10,000 and $50,000. However,
for some tracts of land, the costs associated with restoring wetlands may exceed the value derived from the agricultural
activity, in which case the cost attributable to critical habitat would be the loss in agricultural income. The costs
attributable to a designation of critical habitat are not expected to substantially affect levee maintenance operations
because Federal regulatory agencies currently have restrictions that generally avoid adverse effects to the delta
smelt. However, the designation of critical habitat may result in leaving the Montezuma Slough Control Structure's
gates open from December to August rather than November to March. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will prepare a final economic analysis prior to making its final determination on critical habitat. If
that analysis substantially differs from the draft summarized here, the Service will make a revised economic analysis
available to the public for comment prior to a final determination on critical habitat.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by
the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking
and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is subsequently listed and its critical habitat is designated, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal
agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species
or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy (see ``Effects of Critical
Habitat Designation'' section), are directly related. Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery
and extinction of the species. The closer a species is to recovery, the greater the certainty of the species' continued
survival. Thus, the terms survival and recovery are related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist
over a given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that influence a species' viability include population
numbers, distribution throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive success. A species
may be considered recovered when there is a high degree of certainty for the species' continued viability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species'
conservation, which, by definition, means recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat apply to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species,
thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation
to the goals and recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery,
the prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat should protect the critical habitat's
ability to contribute fully to a species' recovery. Thus, the adverse modification standard may be reached closer
to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas the jeopardy standard traditionally has been applied nearer
to the extinction end of the continuum.

Federal actions that may affect the delta smelt or its critical habitat, should any be designated, include those authorized,
carried out, or funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, National Marine Fisheries Service,
and EPA. The Army Corps of Engineers funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and diversion facilities,
levee construction or repair, bank protection activities, deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil
disposal projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge construction, diking of wetlands for conversion
to farmland, and tidal gate or barrier installation. The Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of Water
Resources construct, operate, and/or manage water export facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards
and promulgates replacement standards, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, if the State standards are found to be inadequate.
In 1991, EPA disapproved portions of the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality Control
Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has prepared
proposed replacement standards for those portions of the State's salinity standards that were disapproved. Measures
to protect the federally listed winter-run chinook salmon, for which the National Marine Fisheries Service has jurisdiction
under the Act, also may affect the delta smelt and may require consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4 of the Act, listing of the delta smelt provided a requirement for the development of a recovery plan.
The Service convened the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a recovery plan for declining native fishes
in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary. The recovery plan will develop a framework for Federal, State, and private
entities to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery
priorities and estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery goals. Site-specific management
actions necessary to achieve survival and recovery of the delta smelt and other fishes native to the Estuary ecosystem
also will be described in this plan.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 4-month comment period following publication of the October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), proposed rule to list
the delta smelt as threatened and designate its critical habitat, the Service received 360 comments (i.e., letters
and oral testimony) from 348 individuals. The Service received several letters supporting designation of delta
smelt critical habitat as proposed. Many local government agencies, water districts, business and trade associations,
and other private interests submitted comments regarding the presumed economic effects of the proposed critical
habitat designation on industries, planned activities, and development in specific municipalities or geographic
regions of California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that the public comment period on the proposed designation
of critical habitat for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to allow the Service to consider any information
that previously had not been submitted. In response, the Service received seven letters: two in support of critical
habitat designation as proposed, four in opposition, and a letter from EPA requesting that the Service consider the
biological and hydrological information described in EPA's draft proposed rule to promulgate Bay/Delta water quality
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt has been revised to reflect the best scientific
information currently available and to ensure that the Service coordinates its final actions with other interested
Federal agencies. For this reason, the Service will address all comments previously received on the economic impacts,
legal requirements, and interpretation of various provisions of the Act during preparation of a final rule. Additionally,
comments received during the 60-day comment period following publication of this revised proposed rule will be used
in preparing a final rule. Only comments addressing the issue of available scientific information used to revise
this proposed rule are responded to in this document. In its final determination on the designation of critical habitat,
the Service will provide a thorough discussion of all comments received in response to the original proposed rule
and to this revised proposed rule.

Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has substantially revised the primary constituent elements in this proposed rule to reflect more closely
the historical placement of low salinity estuarine habitat in Suisun Bay. As part of the background for formulation
of its proposed water quality standards, EPA analyzed the number of days that low salinity (2 ppt) water historically
was located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, Chipps Island, and Roe Island in Suisun Bay.
The Service has revised the primary constituent elements to include those features that provide temporal and spatial
variability of low salinity waters that will deter further invasion of exotic species, produce high zooplankton
densities for food, and simulate natural processes and historical conditions. The ``Primary Constituent Elements''
section of this revised proposed rule describes in detail the months that each delta smelt life stage requires protective
habitat conditions. This revised proposal refines the primary constituent elements to more accurately replicate
historical conditions that are needed to recover the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the Service does not have enough scientific data to substantiate the conclusions that the
location of low salinity habitat in Suisun Bay is important to the recovery of the delta smelt, that delta smelt are
associated with the saltwater-freshwater mixing zone, or that water exports could adversely affect delta smelt
critical habitat as currently proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service Response: Section 4(b)(B)(2) of the Act requires that critical habitat designations be based on the best
scientific data available. As discussed in the ``Habitat Requirements'' and ``Primary Constituent Elements''
sections of this rule, the best available scientific evidence shows that when the entrapment zone is located in a broad
geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone, high densities of phytoplankton
and zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980) and larval and juvenile fish, including delta smelt,
grow rapidly (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). When the entrapment zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta smelt are dispersed
widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water and marsh habitat (Harry Seraydarian, EPA, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Dispersion in areas downstream from the State and Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions
protects young smelt from entrainment (diverted into man-made structures or impinged on screens) and distributes
them among the extensive, protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In contrast, high exports
cause the entrapment zone to be pulled upstream into the deep river channels (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). The large river channels are smaller in total surface area, contain fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent
water currents, and lack high zooplankton densities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Service seeks to coordinate its final actions with other interested Federal agencies and because the
Service also has received new distributional information since the October 3, 1991, proposal to designate critical
habitat for the delta smelt, the Service hereby revises the proposal to designate critical habitat. This proposed
rule revision is based on materials received during the public comment period and information received during numerous
meetings and discussions with State and Federal agency biologists, ichthyologists, engineers, and hydrologists.
This new proposal supersedes the October 3, 1991, proposal.

Public Comments Solicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments are particularly
sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The reasons why any habitat (either existing or additional areas) should or should not be determined to be critical
habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Current or planned activities and their possible impacts on proposed critical habitat areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any foreseeable economic or other impacts resulting from the proposed designation of critical habitat; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Economic values associated with benefits of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The methodology the Service might use, under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, in determining whether the benefits of
excluding an area from critical habitat outweigh the benefits of specifying the area as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the primary constituent elements used in determining which areas to propose as critical habitat for the delta
smelt were determined in coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality standards, the Service
also encourages the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any
other interested party to provide comments or suggestions to EPA on its proposed rule to promulgate Water Quality
Standards for Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta of the State
of California. The Fish and Wildlife Service will consider these comments also in developing its final rule. EPA's
proposed rule is published in this same

As stated previously, all comments that have been received during the preceding public comment periods on the economic
impacts, legal requirements, and biological or ecological requirements or effects of critical habitat designation
will be considered during preparation of a final rule. Additionally, comments received during the 60-day comment
period following publication of this revised proposed rule will be used in preparing a final rule. The final decision
on the designation of critical habitat will take into consideration the comments and any additional information
received by the Service and will include any exclusion determinations.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department of the Interior has determined that
the proposed rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within critical
habitat areas, significant economic impacts will not result from the critical habitat designation. Also, no direct
costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities
by this designation. Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened status for the Sacramento splittail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
macrolepidotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended (Act). Sacramento splittail occur in Suisun Bay and the San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail has declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This species is primarily threatened by large freshwater exports from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento and San Joaquin River diversions, prolonged drought, loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shallow-water habitat, introduced aquatic species, and agricultural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial chemicals. This proposal, if made final, would implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection and recovery provisions afforded by the Act for Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail. The Service seeks all available data and comments from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public regarding this proposal.

As used in this rule, the term ``Delta'' refers to all tidal waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained within the legal definition of the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, as delineated
by section 12220 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State of California's Water Code of 1969. Generally, the Delta is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained within a triangular area that extends south from the city of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento to the confluence of the Stanislaus and San Joaquin Rivers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the southeast corner and Chipps Island in Suisun Bay at the southwest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corner. The term ``Estuary,'' as used in this rule, refers to tidal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters contained in the Sacramento River and San Joaquin Rivers, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta, and the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Sacramento splittail were first described in 1854 by W.O. Ayres as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Leuciscus macrolepidotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and by S.F. Baird and C. Girard as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaeqilobus.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although Ayres' species description is accepted, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species was assigned to the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. ciscoides,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 endemic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Clear Lake, Lake County, California, has been extinct since the early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1970s. The Sacramento splittail (hereafter splittail) represents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only extant species in its genus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The splittail is a large cyprinid that can exceed 40 centimeters (16 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inches) in length (Moyle 1976). Adults are characterized by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elongated body, distinct nuchal hump, and small, blunt head, usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with barbels at the corners of the slightly subterminal mouth. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enlarged dorsal lobe of the caudal fin distinguishes the splittail from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other minnows in the Central Valley of California. Splittail are dull, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silvery-gold on the sides and olive-gray dorsally. During spawning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season, the pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins are tinged with an orange-red color. Males develop small white nuptial
tubercles on the head. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Splittail are endemic to California's Central Valley, where they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were once widely distributed (Moyle 1976). Historically, splittail were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found as far north as Redding on the Sacramento River, as far south as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the present-day site of Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River, and as far 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream as the current Oroville Dam site on the Feather River and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Folsom Dam site on the American River (Rutter 1908). Recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anglers in Sacramento reported catches of 50 or more splittail per day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to damming of these rivers (Caywood 1974). The species was used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the Central Valley Native American diet (Caywood 1974).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent times, dams and diversions have increasingly prevented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream access to large rivers, and the species is now restricted to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small portion of its former range (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). Splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter the lower reaches of the Feather (Jones and Stokes 1993) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Rivers (Charles Hanson, State Water Contractors Association, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993) on occasion; however, the species now largely is confined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Delta, Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, and Napa Marsh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Splittail are relatively long-lived, frequently reaching 5 to 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years of age. Females are highly fecund and produce over 100,000 eggs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year. Populations fluctuate annually depending on spawning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success, which is highly correlated with freshwater outflow and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of shallow-water habitat with submerged vegetation (Daniels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Moyle 1983). Fish usually reach sexual maturity by the end of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second year. Some variability in the period of reproduction exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because older individuals reproduce first, followed by younger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals (Caywood 1974). The onset of spawning is associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rising temperature, and peak spawning occurs from the months of March 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through May, although records of spawning exist for late January to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early July (Wang 1986). Spawning occurs over flooded vegetation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tidal freshwater and euryhaline habitats of estuarine marshes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sloughs and slow-moving reaches of large rivers. Larvae remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shallow, weedy areas close to spawning sites and move into deeper water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as they mature (Wang 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Splittail are benthic foragers that feed on opossum shrimp (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neomysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercedis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), although detrital material makes up a large percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their stomach content (Daniels and Moyle 1983). Earthworms, clams, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insect larvae, and other invertebrates also are found in the diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Predators include striped bass and other piscivores. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although primarily a freshwater species, the splittail can tolerate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinities as high as 10 to 18 parts per thousand (ppt) (Moyle 1976, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). In recent years, this fish has been found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most often in slow-moving sections of rivers and sloughs and dead-end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sloughs (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1982, Daniels and Moyle 1983). Reports from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1950s, however, mention Sacramento River spawning migrations and catches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of splittail during fast tides in Suisun Bay (Caywood 1974). Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they require flooded vegetation for spawning and rearing, splittail are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently found in areas subject to flooding, such as the major flood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basins distributed throughout the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) survey data from the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 years indicate that the highest catches occurred in shallow areas of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun and Grizzly Bays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The decline in splittail abundance has taken place during increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human-induced changes to seasonal estuary hydrology and freshwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exports and the accompanying changes in the temporal, spatial, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative ratios of water diversions. These deleterious hydrological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, coupled with severe drought years, introduced aquatic species, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and loss of shallow-water habitat to reclamation, seem to have reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species' capacity to recover from natural seasonal fluctuations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrology for which it was adapted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Analyses of survey data collected since 1967 (Meng 1993) by Service, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDFG, and University of California, Davis, biologists from several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different studies indicate the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) On average, splittail have declined in abundance by 62 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since 1984. Percent decline varied among studies, dependent upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of sampling effort. The greatest declines (over 80 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were found from studies that sampled the shallow Suisun Bay area, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
center of the species' range. A study that began in 1980 at the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary, the outermost edge of splittail range, found the lowest percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline (34 percent). The number of splittail young taken at State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal pumping facilities (per acre-foot of water pumped) has declined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64 percent since 1984; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Successful reproduction in splittail is highly correlated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wet years, but within these wet years, young-of-the-year taken per unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort has declined steadily from a high of 12.3 in 1978 to 0.3 in 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) A strong relationship exists between young-of-the-year abundance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and outflow (i.e., river outflow into San Francisco Bay after water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exports are removed). As outflow increases, annual abundance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail young increases. Changes in outflow explain 73 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes seen in splittail young abundance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) When young-of-the-year abundance is predicted using unimpaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outflow (i.e., river outflow without water exports removed), abundance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is higher than expected in dry years, indicating that water exports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect young-of-the-year abundance in dry years. In dry years when river 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outflow is reduced, high proportions of outflow are diverted, resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lower than expected splittail young numbers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (5) Lower than expected numbers of splittail young persisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the recent 6-year drought in California. This prolonged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of poor reproductive success may affect the stock's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (6) Splittail are most abundant in shallow areas of Suisun and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grizzly Bays and are vulnerable to increased salinities. Salinities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase when, as a result of water exports and drought conditions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone (mixing zone at the freshwater-saltwater interface) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moved upstream. Concentration of splittail in shallow areas suggests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they are particularly vulnerable to reclamation activities, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dredging and the diking and filling of wetlands; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (7) Splittail distribution has shifted upstream into the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento River and South Delta since 1983. Ninety-one percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail captured in San Pablo and lower Suisun Bays from 1967 to 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were taken before 1983, and 77 percent of the splittail captured in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower Sacramento River and South Delta were taken after 1983. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and Federal water project pumps are located near the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento River and South Delta, this upstream shift in splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution increases splittail mortality at the pumps. In 1993, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of splittail young taken at the Federal pumping facility was four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times higher than in previous years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A variety of factors affects the estuarine ecosystems and has led to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decline of Sacramento splittail. Principal among these factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific to the Estuary are the altered hydraulics and reduced outflow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Delta caused by export of freshwater from the Sacramento and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Joaquin Rivers through State and Federal water diversion projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional threats to this species include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Loss at pumping plants and in-Delta diversion sites, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Loss of spawning and nursery habitat as a consequence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draining and diking for agriculture, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The causes of splittail decline in the Estuary are multiple and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synergistically threaten this species. The individual threats include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduced river outflows, primarily in the Sacramento and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Loss of shallow-water habitat; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mortality caused by diversion into State and Federal water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects and privately-operated agricultural in-Delta water diversions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Human and natural perturbations of the food web;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service included the Sacramento splittail as a category 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate species for possible future listing as endangered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened in the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category 2 includes species for which information contained in Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
files indicates that proposing to list is possibly appropriate but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional data is needed to support a listing proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1992, the Service received a petition from Mr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gregory A. Thomas of the Natural Heritage Institute to add the splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for this species in the Sacramento and San Joaquin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rivers and those estuaries. In his letter, Mr. Thomas identified the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following eight organizations as co-petitioners: American Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Society, Bay Institute of San Francisco, Natural Heritage Institute, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planning and Conservation League, Save San Francisco Bay Association, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Friends of the River, San Francisco Baykeeper, and the Sierra Club. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 24, 1993, the Service issued a 90-day finding, notice of which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36184), that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petition presented substantial information indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested action may be warranted. The Service initiated a status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and analyzed available data on this species (Meng 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional sources of information describing the human factors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects that may affect this species include expert testimonies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented to the California State Water Resources Control Board's 1987 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Quality/Water Rights Proceeding on the San Francisco Bay and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and 1992 Water Rights Phase of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay-Delta Estuary Proceedings. This proposal constitutes the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding on the petition to list the Sacramento splittail.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and

regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing

provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sacramento splittail was once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widely distributed in the Central Valley of California from Redding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modern-day site of Friant Dam near the City of Fresno. It is now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted to western, northern, and southern portions of the Delta due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to dams, diversions, dredging, and the diking and filling of historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flood basins. Within the species' constricted range, splittail have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declined by 62 percent since 1984. However, the overall percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline over its historical range is much greater. Populations have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluctuated somewhat in the past, with most recruitment taking place in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wet years. In wet years since 1976, however, splittail recruitment has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declined consistently with catches per unit effort of 12.3, 8.1, 2.0, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.3, and 0.3 for 1978, 1982, 1983, 1986, and 1993, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Splittail declines are highest (82 percent) in the shallow-water Suisun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay area, which is the center of its distribution. This may reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of productive brackish-water habitat in Suisun and Grizzly Bays due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to increased salinities caused by low outflows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Delta water diversions and exports total to about 9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million acre-feet per year. Federal and State projects presently export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 6 million acre-feet per year when sufficient water is available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in-Delta agricultural uses result in diversion of about 3 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional acre-feet per year. Plans currently being prepared could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially induce increased exports and diversions in the future. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service knows of 22 major Central Valley Project, State Water Project, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or private organization proposals that would result in increased water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exports from the Delta, reduced water inflow to the Delta, changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the timing and volume of Delta inflow, or increases in heavy metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination of the Delta. These proposed projects or actions include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but are not limited to Central Valley Project Operations Criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan (including Friant Contract Renewals), Los Banos Grandes Reservoir, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Marsh Project Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three and Four, Kern Water Bank, Arvin Edison water storage and exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, Federal Water Project change in diversion point, and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Project Pump additions. These projects would modify or destroy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the habitat of this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Federal pumping plant has been operated at capacity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many years except for a few drought years, increased exports at this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant appear unlikely. However, the State Water Project pumping plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the capacity of the State Aqueduct have considerable unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity. The California Department of Water Resources (1992) reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the past and projected State Water Project deliveries from Delta sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the years of 1962 to 2035. In the 1980s, deliveries ranged from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.5 million acre-feet to 2.8 million acre-feet. By 2010, deliveries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up to 4.2 million acre-feet are planned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1983, the proportion of water exported from the Delta during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October through March has been higher than in earlier years (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). The timing of these proportionally higher exports have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coincided with the spawning season of the splittail. Federal and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water diversion projects in the southern Delta export, by absolute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume, mostly Sacramento River water with some San Joaquin River water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, during periods of high export pumping and low to moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river outflows, reaches of the San Joaquin River reverse direction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow upstream to the pumping plants located in the southern Delta. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-operated pumping plant presently exports water at rates up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6,400 cubic feet per second (cfs). The State is considering proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to export an additional 3,900 cfs. The Federal pumping plant can export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water at rates up to 4,600 cfs. In addition, local private diverters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export up to 5,000 cfs from about 1,800 diversions scattered throughout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When total diversion rates are high relative to Delta outflow, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lower San Joaquin River and other channels have a net upstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., reverse or negative) flow, out-migrating larval and juvenile fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of many species become disoriented. Large mortalities occur as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of loss to pumps and predation by striped bass at the various water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and other diversion sites. Because data from State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal pumping facilities indicate that splittail migrate upstream to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawn, positive outflows are also important to transport splittail young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downstream (Meng 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, the number of days of reversed San Joaquin River 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow have increased (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992), particularly during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February-June spawning months for splittail. All size classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail young suffer near total loss when they are entrained by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pumping plants and diversions in the south Delta. Few young are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively salvaged at the Federal and State pumping plant screens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This species' embryonic, larval, and postlarval mortality rates also are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher when reduced outflows cause increases in salinity and relocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the entrapment zone (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Splittail are adapted for life in the entrapment zone. Estuaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ecosystems where the entrapment zone and salinity levels are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the interaction of river outflow and tidal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Splittail are most abundant in the shallow waters of Suisun Bay, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is historically associated with the entrapment zone. The young of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species require high zooplankton densities produced by the entrapment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zone environment. The best survival and growth of splittail occurs when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the entrapment zone occupies a large geographic area with extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shoal regions within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fall mid-water trawl survey data collected by CDFG indicate that 76 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the splittail captured from 1967 to 1992 in the Delta were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken in the shallow areas of Suisun and Grizzly Bays (Meng 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During periods of drought and increased water diversions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone and associated fish populations are shifted farther 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream in the Estuary. During years prior to 1984, the entrapment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zone was located in Suisun Bay from October through March (except in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months with exceptionally high outflows or during years of extreme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought). From April through September, the entrapment zone usually was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found upstream in the river channels. Since 1984, with the exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the record 1986 flood outflows, the entrapment zone has been located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily in the river channels during the entire year because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought and increased water exports and diversions. When located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream, the entrapment zone is confined to deep river channels where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total surface area is smaller, fewer shoal areas of suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning substrate exist, water currents are swifter and more turbulent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and zooplankton productivity is low. In all respects, the upstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river channels are much less favorable for spawning and rearing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail. Splittail declines since 1984 have been concurrent with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing amount and proportion of freshwater diversions that confine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the entrapment zone to the narrow, deep, and less productive channels in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lower rivers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This factor is not known to be applicable. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific collecting is conducted for splittail, but these activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not adversely affect this species. Little or no recreational harvest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of splittail is likely occurring because the population has dramatically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declined, and it is not a desirable game species. No recent records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail harvest exist, probably because little or no harvest occurs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the identification of this species is often confused with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nongame species. No other recreational or educational uses of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species exist that may affect its abundance.

C. Disease or Predation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This factor is not known to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable. However, if the non-native striped bass populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase, all size classes of splittail could be under greater threat of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predation. An effort by CDFG is under way to compensate for striped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bass population mortalities caused by water export projects. The 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
striped bass stock was low relative to the population in the 1960s. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously, the striped bass compensation program annually released 1 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 million juvenile, hatchery-reared striped bass in the Estuary in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to rebuild the population. However, for the last 2 years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director of CDFG has foregone release of striped bass because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential harm they would cause to the federally-threatened Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River winter-run chinook salmon and delta smelt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Suisun Bay is the best known nursery habitat for reproduction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larval survival of splittail, but the habitat has been deleteriously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered by higher salinities in the spring. These higher salinities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by a large number of freshwater diversions that allow seawater to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intrude farther upstream. At present, there are relatively few periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when freshwater outflow volumes through the Delta and Suisun Bay of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance are mandated for wildlife or fisheries. State and Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies had planned to increase 1991 and 1992 water supplies for out-of-stream uses at the expense of environmental
protection of estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and wildlife resources in the fifth and potentially sixth years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought (Morat 1991). Because of significantly higher than normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitation and subsequent higher instream flows after March 1991, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency request for relaxation of Delta water quality standards was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawn. Should a California drought return, water quality relaxation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action likely will be requested again to favor out-of-stream water use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the need to protect aquatic habitats for fish and wildlife. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present regulatory processes do not ensure that water inflows to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay and the western Estuary will be adequate to maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone near or in Suisun Bay to benefit splittail. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California State Water Resources Control Board (Board) has the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to condition or require changes in the amount of water inflow and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of water exported or diverted from the Delta. In testimony given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the Board's Water Quality/Water Rights Hearings in 1987, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service biologist expressed concern for several Delta species including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail (Lorentzen 1987). The Board did not take regulatory or legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action to protect this fish or its habitat during the four following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. On May 1, 1991, the Board adopted the Water Quality Control Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary (1991 Bay/Delta Plan). On September 3, 1991, under provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disapproved certain water quality standards for the Board's failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt criteria to protect estuarine habitat. In 1993, EPA began the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of formulating replacement standards for those portions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991 Bay/Delta Plan that were disapproved. In January 1992, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governor of California announced a new water policy that included a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directive to the Board to establish ``interim measures'' to reverse the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline of fishes in the Bay and Delta. Accordingly, the Board released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an interim water quality plan (Draft Decision 1630) in December 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that immediately was suspended by the Governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed rule to promulgate Water Quality Standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bay and Delta is published in this same 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate part; however, enforcement of these standards may be difficult. The Service is aware that the salinity standards
currently in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Water Right Decision 1485) are inconsistently implemented and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently violated. Institutional guarantees of compliance have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lacking in the past and are needed in the future before existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms can contribute to the protection of this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service currently is analyzing the potential effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail and other fish and wildlife resources in California as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of recent enactment of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;575). Two of the stated purposes of this act are to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Protect, restore, and enhance fish, wildlife, and associated habitats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Central Valley and Trinity River basins of California'' and ``to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to the State of California's interim and long-term efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3406(b)(2) dedicates 800,000 acre-feet of Central Valley Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water annually for various purposes, including the benefit of federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed species. Although the Service is reasonably certain that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail will realize some benefit from implementation of the Central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley Project Improvement Act, the magnitude and timeliness of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protections may be inadequate to prevent further decline of splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protective measures currently being implemented to benefit the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt will beneficially affect the splittail by restricting pumping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under certain conditions. However, the ecological requirements of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species differ, especially with respect to timing of important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental stages and habitat use. Splittail need flooded lowland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat for spawning and are particularly vulnerable to disturbance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction of marshy habitat. Therefore, the protections afforded the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt, listed as threatened in 1993 under the Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, will not be sufficient to prevent further decline of the splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, the Service considers the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory mechanisms inadequate to ensure the long-term existence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento splittail.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Splittail are vulnerable to extinction from stochastic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events because of the consistent decline in population indices and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severely constricted ranges and distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poor water quality also may adversely affect splittail, either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through direct exposure to toxins or depletion of zooplankton or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invertebrate food sources. All major rivers that are tributary to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary are exposed to large volumes of agricultural and industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that are applied in the Central Valley watershed (Nichols et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1986). Agricultural chemicals and their residues, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals originating in urban runoff, find their way into the rivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Estuary. Approximately 10 percent of the total pesticide use in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States occurs in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River watersheds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily on orchards, alfalfa, and rice during the months of January to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June of each year (Jewel Bennett, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Recently, high concentrations of organophosphate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbamate pesticides from agricultural uses have been documented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering the Estuary. These pesticides are acutely toxic to zooplankton 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fishes as far west as Martinez in Suisun Bay and as far south as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vernalis on the San Joaquin River (Bennett, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of pesticide use coincide with the timing of migration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning, and early development of splittail. During rainfall runoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events, acutely toxic pulses of pesticides move down the rivers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the Estuary with remarkable persistence and relatively little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toxicology studies of rice field irrigation drain water of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colusa Basin Drainage Canal have documented significant toxicity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drain water to striped bass embryos and larvae, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oryzias latipes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
larvae 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(in the Cyprinodontidae family), and the opossum shrimp, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major food organism of striped bass larvae and juveniles (Bailey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1991). This drainage canal flows into the Sacramento River just north 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the City of Sacramento. The majority of drain water samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected during April and May 1990 were acutely toxic to striped bass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larvae (96 hour exposures); this was the third consecutive year that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colusa Basin rice irrigation drain water was acutely toxic (Bailey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991). Splittail may be similarly affected by agricultural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial chemical run-off. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some heavy metal contaminants have been released into the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from industrial and mining enterprises. While the effects of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminating compounds on splittail larvae and their zooplankton food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources are not well known, the compounds could adversely affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survival. In addition, increases in urban development in the Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley will continue to result in concurrent increases in urban runoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selenium has been found in aquatic organisms (Saiki and Lowe 1987) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish species in the San Joaquin River watershed (Nakamoto and Hassler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992). Selenium has been shown to cause developmental defects in and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortality of fish species (Hermanutz 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, untreated discharges of ship ballast water has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced exotic aquatic species to the Estuary ecosystem (Carlton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Several exotic species may adversely affect the splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An asian clam (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Potamocorbula amurensis), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
introduced as veliger larvae in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986, was first discovered in Suisun Bay during October 1986. By June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1987, the Asian clam was widespread in Suisun, San Pablo, and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bays irrespective of salinity, water depth, and sediment type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at densities greater than 10,000 individuals per square meter. Asian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clam densities declined to 4,000 individuals per square meter as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population aged during the year (Carlton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Persistently low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river outflow and concomitant elevated salinity levels may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributed to this species' population explosion (Carlton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Asian clam could potentially play an important role in affecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phytoplankton dynamics in the Estuary. The clam may have an effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher trophic levels by decreasing phytoplankton biomass.

Eurytemora affinis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the native euryhaline copepod,

is difficult for larval fishes

(Meng and Orsi 1991). Reduced feeding efficiency and ingestion rates

weaken and slow the growth of splittail young and make them more

vulnerable to starvation or predation.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail have declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This species has been extirpated from portions of its range. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary during the past 2 decades, the entrapment zone, associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the important nurseries for splittail, has been more frequently shifted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream to a confined area of greater depth as a result of drought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, water management schedules, and the continual and increasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand for water exports and diversions. These factors will continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affect all life stages of splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Threatened status is proposed for the Sacramento splittail because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of several factors. The population has declined by 62 percent within 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. The historical and current range of the species is constricted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in water salinity and the reverse flow of water has shifted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of individuals upstream and has caused the fish to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerable to State and Federal pumping plants. The death of these fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to pumping continues at present and is likely to continue in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. Water exports also threaten the quality and quantity of habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at present and for the future. Because Sacramento splittail are long-lived, their decline has been gradual, and extinction
is not imminent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing the splittail as endangered would not be appropriate. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this species is not in imminent danger of extinction at this time, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the evaluation of all available information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundance, present distribution, and threats to this species, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service has determined that proposing to list the Sacramento splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as threatened is appropriate at this time. Critical habitat is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinable for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule.

Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrently with proposing a species to be endangered or threatened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that designation of critical habitat for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail is not determinable at this time. Regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 CFR 424.12(a)(2) state that critical habitat is not determinable if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not sufficiently known to permit identification of an area of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. The Service's efforts to gather information on the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of designating critical habitat for splittail may lead to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that designation of critical habitat is not prudent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at 50 CFR 424.12(a)(1) state that a designation of critical

habitat is not prudent when the species is threatened by taking or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or when such

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequently listed and its critical habitat is designated, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal actions that may affect the splittail or its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, should any be designated, include those authorized, carried 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out, or funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Marine Fisheries Service, and EPA. The Army Corps of Engineers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and diversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge construction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal gate or barrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation. The Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Resources construct, operate, and/or manage water export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement standards, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, if State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are found to be inadequate. In 1991, EPA disapproved portions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Joaquin Delta Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has published in this same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 separate part proposed replacement standards for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the State's salinity standards that were disapproved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4 of the Act, listing the splittail will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional impetus for the development of a recovery plan to bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together Federal, State, and private efforts to develop conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies for this species. The Service has convened the Delta Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a recovery plan for declining native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishes in the Estuary. The recovery plan will develop a framework for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery of the splittail and other fishes native to the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem also will be described in this plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened wildlife not covered by a special rule. These prohibitions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of the United States to take (including harass, harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interstate or foreign commerce any such species. It also is illegal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service and State conservation agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving endangered or threatened wildlife species under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17.23. Permits for threatened species are available for scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. In some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances, permits may be issued during a specified period of time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not available. For threatened species, permits are lawful for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zoological exhibition, educational purposes, or special functions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the purposes of the Act. Further information regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service intends that any final action resulting from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly are sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any threat (or lack thereof) to this species; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The location and status of any additional populations of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biological information that would be useful in determining whether to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate critical habitat includes descriptions and locations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning habitat and life history information on behavior and ecological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population size of this species; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible impacts on this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and any additional information received by the Service, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such communications may lead to final regulations that differ from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed to the Acting Field Supervisor, Sacramento Field Office (see

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 1-year finding on a petition to list the longfin smelt (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Spirinchus thaleichthys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service determines that the petitioned action is
not warranted at this time. The longfin smelt occurs from the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary
in California to Prince William Sound in Alaska. Although the southernmost populations are declining, little or
no population trend data are available for estuaries in Oregon and Washington. The species may be surviving and reproducing
in Puget Sound, Skagit Bay, Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, the Columbia River, Yaquina Bay, and Coos Bay. Large numbers
are found in the Gulf of Alaska 5 to 6 miles off shore. The listing of a Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary vertebrate
population segment is also not warranted at this time because that population does not seem to be biologically significant
to the species as a whole, and may not be sufficiently reproductively isolated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 5, 1992, the Service received a petition from Mr. Gregory A. Thomas of the Natural Heritage Institute to
add the longfin smelt to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate critical habitat in the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers and estuary. In his letter, Mr. Thomas identified the following eight organizations as co-petitioners:
American Fisheries Society, Bay Institute of San Francisco, Natural Heritage Institute, Planning and Conservation
League, Save San Francisco Bay Association, Friends of the River, San Francisco Baykeeper, and the Sierra Club. On
June 24, 1993, the Service issued a 90-day finding, a notice of which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36184), that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the requested
action may be warranted. The Service initiated a status review and analyzed available data on this species (Meng 1993).
Additional sources of information describing the human factors and projects that may affect this species include
expert testimonies presented to the California State Water Resources Control Board's 1987 Water Quality/Water
Rights Proceeding on the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and 1992 Water Rights Phase of the
Bay-Delta Estuary Proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires that the Service issue a finding within 1 year of the receipt of the petition
on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded from immediate
proposal by other pending proposals of higher priority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In casual conversations, the petitioner indicated that he intended the petition to be a request to list the Sacramento-San
Joaquin River estuary population. However, the Service did not receive this request in writing and, in any case, was
required to review the status of the species on a rangewide basis prior to considering the appropriateness of listing
individual population segments. The Service determines that listing of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary population
segment of the longfin smelt is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Longfin smelt is an euryhaline species with a 2-year life cycle (Moyle 1976, Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). Spawning occurs
in fresh water over sandy-gravel substrates, rocks, or aquatic plants. Spawning may take place as early as November
and extend into June, although the peak spawning period is from February to April (Wang 1986). After hatching, larvae
move up into surface waters and are transported downstream into brackish-water nursery areas. Sacramento-San Joaquin
River outflow into Suisun and San Pablo Bays has been positively correlated with longfin smelt recruitment (Stevens
and Miller 1983) because higher outflow increases larval dispersal and the area available for rearing (Wang 1986).
The main food of longfin smelt is opossum shrimp, although copepods and other crustaceans also are eaten (Moyle 1976).
Longfin smelt are preyed upon by fishes, birds, and marine mammals (Monaco et al. 1991). Longfin smelt play a role in
maintaining the structure and function of estuarine ecosystems because they are important as food for birds and piscivorous
fishes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As presently described, longfin smelt range from the San Joaquin-Sacramento River estuary and South San Francisco
Bay, California, to Prince William Sound, Alaska (Miller and Lea 1972). The present-day distribution of longfin
smelt is probably due to lower sea levels in the Pleistocene, which would have enlarged estuaries up and down the Pacific
coast and shortened the distances between estuaries, as well as provide more habitat (Peter Moyle, University of
California, Davis, pers. comm., 1993). Unverified reports of off-shore collection of longfin smelt exist, approximately
5 to 6 miles off shore in Alaska (Bruce Wing, National Marine Fisheries Service, Auke Bay, Alaska, pers. comm., 1993)
and 3 to 4 miles off shore in northern California (Larry Quirollo, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm.,
1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on inferred abundance, longfin smelt may be common in Willapa Bay, Skagit Bay, and Puget Sound in Washington
and Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay in Oregon (Monaco 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Largely using sampling data, Monaco 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1990) also reported that longfin smelt were common to highly abundant in the Columbia River and Grays Harbor, Washington.
Few data exist on the recent status of the Oregon and Washington longfin smelt; however, indications are that this
species may be reproducing and surviving in the Oregon and Washington estuaries (Bob Emmett, National Marine Fisheries
Service, Hammond, Oregon, pers. comm., 1993). A land-locked population exists in Harrison Lake in British Columbia.
British Columbia longfin smelt have also been recorded at the Fraser River estuary and near Prince Rupert and Vancouver
(Hart 1973). Alaska longfin smelt are found at the Dixon Entrance, Yakutat Bay, Prince William Sound, and Cook Inlet
(Wing, pers. comm., 1993). In California, the longfin smelt occurs (or did occur) in the Klamath River mouth, Humboldt
Bay, Eel River mouth, Van Duzen River mouth, and the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary (Moyle 1976;
Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992; Ron Fritzsche, Humboldt State University, pers. comm., 1993). The Estuary supports the
largest and most southerly longfin smelt population in California (Lee 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The strongest information on the decline of longfin smelt comes from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary of
California. Longfin smelt were once one of the most abundant fish caught by trawl surveys in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
(Herbold 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992) and Humboldt Bay estuaries (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993). Longfin smelt numbers in the Estuary fluctuated
widely in the past, but since 1983 abundance has dropped dramatically and remained at record lows. In Humboldt Bay,
longfin smelt were the fourth most abundant fish captured in trawls in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Roger Barnhart,
National Biological Survey, pers. comm., 1993). However, since 1988, no longfin smelt have been captured in Humboldt
Bay using similar sampling methods (Tim Mulligan, Humboldt State University, pers. comm., 1993). Historical records
of longfin smelt from the mouth of the Van Duzen River exist; however, in recent years, no evidence of the fish exists
for this location (Fritzsche, pers. comm., 1993). The Eel River, which is about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) from Humboldt
Bay, is relatively small and probably contains little habitat appropriate for longfin smelt. Longfin smelt likely
occurred in the Eel River only when high river outflows introduced fish from Humboldt Bay. Longfin smelt numbers probably
declined in the Eel River at the same time declines occurred in Humboldt Bay. Recent surveys have not found the longfin
in the Eel estuary (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993). In Oregon and Washington, no population trend data exist for any of the
estuaries, although the indications are that the species is surviving and reproducing in several estuaries (Emmett,
pers. comm., 1993). In Alaska, large numbers of longfin smelt are found in the Gulf of Alaska (Bruce Wing, National
Marine Fisheries Service, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary the decline in longfin smelt abundance is associated with fresh water
diversions from the Delta to support California's agricultural industry in the Central Valley and the vast urban
areas of southern California. Strong relationships between outflow and longfin smelt abundance indicate that outflows
less than 3,400 cubic feet per second (cfs) result in reproductive failure for longfin smelt (Moyle and Yoshiyama
1992). Because of its 2-year life span, such flows for more than 2 or 3 consecutive years could push this species toward
extinction. From 1986 to 1991, outflows hovered close to that number, partly due to high proportions of inflow diverted.
Movement of the entrapment zone (mixing zone at the freshwater-saltwater interface) up-river due to low outflows
has constricted the range of the longfin smelt and made it increasingly vulnerable to diversion into man-made structures.
Low outflows have failed to disperse larvae downstream to the productive nursery areas in Suisun Bay away from the
pumps. The water exports from the Delta by far exceed those from any other estuary on the west coast of North America.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sediment production as a result of human activities and developments in the Humboldt, Eel, Van Duzen, and Klamath
watersheds may be a cause of the decline of longfin smelt in those estuaries. Soil washed into the streams can deposit
in estuaries downstream. Sedimentation in the spawning habitat could have reduced the spawning success of this species
due to physical scouring or suffocation of eggs (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993). Although human activities upstream
of estuaries in Oregon, Washington, Canada, and Alaska would likely result in similar impacts, the Service does not
have population trend data for these portions of the species' range.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Longfin smelt disappeared from the Humboldt Bay estuary in the 1980s (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993), perhaps as a result
of a dramatic loss of intertidal marsh habitat, which may have reduced productivity levels to a point at which they
could no longer support the species. In addition, the loss of freshwater flows from the Mad River, as a result of water
diversions and land reclamation, may have contributed to the loss of this species from the Humboldt Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Longfin smelt may be particularly sensitive to adverse habitat alterations or to stochastic events because their
2-year life cycle increases the likelihood of extinction after consecutive periods of reproductive failure due
to drought or other factors. Relatively brief periods of reproductive failure could lead to extirpations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in this determination. This species does not appear to be threatened
throughout all or a significant portion of its range or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. However, given
the declines in the southern portion of the species' range and the general lack of population trend data for the remainder
of its range, the Service will include the longfin smelt in category 2 of the next notice of review for animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though the petition was not limited to a portion of the species' range, the petitioner focused on the resident longfin
smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population. In telephone conversations, the petitioner indicated
that he was most interested in a population listing. Longfin smelt numbers in this estuary have declined by 90 percent
since 1984 and by 50 percent annually since 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has listed vertebrate population segments where the entity being listed represented the entire coterminous
United States population (e.g., marbled murrelet, grizzly bear). Some reproductively isolated (or nearly so) vertebrate
population segments that are clearly important to the conservation of an entire species have also been listed under
the Act (e.g., Mojave population of the desert tortoise, coastal population of the western snowy plover).

Although the longfin smelt reportedly is unable to swim between estuaries (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993), unverified
reports of offshore collections exist (Quirollo, pers. comm., 1993; Wing, pers. comm., 1993). Furthermore, the
current distribution is thought to be the result of movements between estuaries that took place during the Pleistocene
when lower sea levels reportedly would have enlarged estuaries along the Pacific coast and shortened the inter-estuarian
distances (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993). Though geographically removed from the closest known extirpated or declining
population (300 miles from the Eel River in California), this isolation does not necessarily indicate that the Sacramento-San
Joaquin River estuary population is significant to a species that has a range of more than 1,900 miles. In addition,
electrophoretic analysis revealed that the accumulated number of codon substitutions per locus (i.e., Nei's genetic
distance) since the time of separation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population and the longfin population
in Lake Washington, Washington, connected to Puget Sound via a system of locks, has been small (0.005 according to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Thus, these populations, separated by approximately 1,000 miles, have genetically diverged only slightly since
their separation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary is clearly an important and significant wetland ecosystem. The longfin
smelt formerly was the fourth most abundant fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary; however, the role of
this declining species in the estuary today is unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this evaluation the Service has determined that the listing of the longfin smelt under the Act is not warranted
at this time. The listing of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population of the longfin smelt is also not warranted
at this time.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare a Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statement
to determine whether to authorize additional snowmaking capability and trail improvements at the Sugarbush South
Ski Area as proposed by Snowridge, Inc. Authorization of the trail improvements and snowmaking would implement a
portion of the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, approved on July 14, 1983. The
proposed use and activities are consistent with the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain National
Forest and the current Special Use Permit for operation of the Sugarbush Ski Resort. Authorization would require
an amendment to the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area so that the Master Development
Plan identifies the water source for snowmaking and the schedule for water withdrawal. The Master Development Plan
would also be amended to accurately show the approved trail configuration and anticipated development schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sugarbush is a winter sports complex operated by Snowridge, Inc. and located on both private lands and National Forest
System lands. There are about 2,100 acres at Sugarbush South, the area where this project is proposed. Of that 2,100
acres, about 1825 acres are National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the actions proposed by Snowridge, Inc. is to improve the quality of winter sports recreation opportunities
at Sugarbush South by installing snowmaking equipment and facilities that would provide coverage over at least 70%
of the ski trails, and by constructing widening, and grading the trail system so that there is improved skier traffic
flow and safety. Improved trail design would also offer a better mix of opportunities for novice, intermediate, advanced,
and expert skiers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional snowmaking is needed because Sugarbush South currently has snowmaking coverage on only 38% of the ski
trails. Natural snowfall is inconsistent and often inadequate during a typical Vermont winter. Predictable snow
coverage is needed if Sugarbush is to consistently provide quality winter sports recreation opportunities, be attractive
to skiers, and remain competitive with other major ski areas in New England. Increased snowmaking will also relieve
skier traffic congestion problems and improve skier safety by providing more opportunities for skiers to disperse
over many trails.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trail widening is needed so that snow grooming equipment can be used and to relieve ``bottle-necks'' where skiers
merge. Trail construction is needed to improve inter-connections among trails, improve skier traffic flow, and
increase the number of intermediate and advanced trails so that the variety of skier experiences available is better
geared to families and groups made up of skiers with different ability levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is to: (1) Construct and operate a water withdrawal facility on the Mad River including a removable
weir, a permanent Parshall flume and two intake structures; (2) Withdraw for snowmaking use an estimated 300&hyph;420
million gallons of water per year (the estimated average is 380 Million gallons per year) from the Mad River under a
schedule which will prohibit withdrawals that would reduce flows to less than the February median flow rate (0.79
csm); (3) Construct and operate a 13-acre water storage pond located adjacent to the Mad River and having a capacity
of approximately 55 to 60 million gallons; (4) Construct and operate pumping facilities adjacent to the water storage
pond; (5) Construct a 15 foot wide, 1,800 foot long gravel access road from Highway 100 to the pond site; (6) Construct
and operate about 3.3 miles of buried 16-inch pipeline to transport water from the storage pond to the snowmaking facilities
at Sugarbush South; (7) Construct and operate a new snowmaking facility located in the vicinity of the existing vehicle
maintenance shop. This is a building housing the pumps, compressors, and control system used for snowmaking; (8)
Install approximately 90,000 feet of buried pipelines and hydrants along 24 trails at Sugarbush South and operate
for snowmaking; (9) Use water from the Mad River source and the existing source on Clay Brook for snowmaking on an additional
157 acres of ski trails; and (10) Widen 24 trails, widen 2 lift lines, construct 6 new trails, and grade several existing
trails. Total widening and trail construction will add 100 acres of skiable terrain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Forest Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have decisions to make with respect to the proposal. The
Forest Service must decide whether to authorize the project under the Special Use Permit and whether to approve amendments
to the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must make
a decision as to whether to issue a permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to authorize the Mad River water withdrawal
structures, holding pond, access road and fill.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Environmental Impact Statement is to determine the environmental effects of the proposed action
and of any reasonable alternatives actions that would also achieve the purpose and need while addressing significant
issues raised through public comment and agency review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternatives may include any combination of feasible water withdrawal sources; water storage sites; and water
withdrawal schedules on source rivers or brooks as long as those alternatives would achieve the purpose and need for
this proposal while addressing significant issues that are identified during the analysis. Alternatives may include
different trail configurations if significant concerns are raised about the trail improvements being proposed.
The analysis will include a discussion of cumulative effects of all water withdrawals in the area affected by this
proposal, including the current withdrawal at Clay Brook, the proposed withdrawal on Mad River, and any alternative
water withdrawals that are identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Environmental Impact Statement and analysis will not reconsider the overall development plans for the Sugarbush
Valley Winter Sports Areas as described in the Master Development Plan approved on July 14, 1983. Forest Supervisor
Terry Hoffman completed a review of that Master Development Plan on September 30, 1993. The Forest Supervisor determined
that there is no need to change the overall development plan or supplement the 1983 Environmental Impact Statement
that was prepared in support of that Plan, except for specific amendments to the Master Development Plan associated
with the proposal from Snowridge Inc. to use the Mad River as a water source for snowmaking, increase the volume of water
used for snowmaking, and revise the trail map (or the alternative to this proposal as selected by the Forest Service).
Those specific amendments are the focus and scope of the Environmental Impact Statement that will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this Notice is to inform you that the Forest Service, with assistance from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers is soliciting your comments and concerns
about this proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental analysis and decision-making process will include opportunities for public participation and
comment so that people interested in this proposal may contribute to the final decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service will host an open house to be held at the Waitsfield Elementary School, Waitsfield, Vermont, from
6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on Monday January 24, 1994. The purpose of this open house is to discuss and answer questions about
the project proposal, the analysis process that will be conducted by the Forest Service and cooperating agencies,
and the ways that people can best participate in the analysis and decision-making process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation will be welcome throughout the analysis, but is especially important at two points. The first
point is during the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). The agency is now seeking written comments and suggestions on
the scope of the analysis. Comments relevant to scoping include: (1) identifying potential issues, (2) identifying
those issues to be analyzed in depth, (3) eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a previous
environmental analysis, (4) identifying additional alternatives to the proposed action that should be considered,
(5) identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives, and (6) determining task
assignments among the lead and cooperating agencies. General notice to the public concerning the scope of the analysis
will be provided by mailings, news releases and/or public meetings. The second point when public participation is
most important is during the public comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Sugarbush is a winter sports area which has operated by Special Use Permit since 1958 on National Forest System lands
administered by the Green Mountain National Forest. Most of the base lodge facilities are on provide lands, but some
of the base facilities and many of the lifts and trails are located on National Forest System lands. Sugarbush encompasses
about 6,000 acres, of which a little over 1,825 acres are on National Forest System lands at Sugarbush South (about
30%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sugarbush operates in accordance with the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, which
was approved by the Forest Service on July 14, 1983. Specific operations on National Forest System lands are authorized
under a Special Use Permit issued by the Forest Service on December 9, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is consistent with the long-range goals for this area as defined in the Land and Resource Management
Plan for the Green Mountain National Forest. That Forest Plan was approved on January 15, 1987. Under that Forest Plan,
the area encompassed by the Suguarbush Ski Area is assigned to management under prescription 7.1A. This management
prescription emphasizes highly developed areas, including downhill ski areas. The purpose of prescription 7.1A
is to provide opportunities for recreation requiring highly developed structures and facilities, maintain a visually
appealing landscape, and manage for other resources and uses in a compatible way. The Forest Service does not anticipate
the need for any amendments to the Land and Resource Management Plan as a result of this snowmaking proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 30, 1993, the Forest Service completed a review of an Environmental Impact Statement completed in 1983
and the Master Development Plan which was approved based on that Environmental Impact Statement. Based on that review,
the Forest Supervisor determined that there was no need to supplement the 1983 Environmental Impact Statement or
revise the Master Development Plan except for amendments to the Master Development Plan that may result from the analysis
of the Mad River water withdrawal proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four amendments to the Master Development Plan would likely be required if the project proposal is approved: (1) Identify
the Mad River as a source of water for snowmaking; (2) Identify the anticipated schedules and volumes for water withdrawal
and any restrictions or requirements related to snowmaking water withdrawal; (3) Revise the Master Development
Plan trails map so that it accurately displays the approved trail configuration for Sugarbush South; and (4) Update
the Development Schedule (Appendix C in the Master Development Plan) so that it shows current estimates of completion
dates for each phase of the previously approved development at Sugarbush. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed snowmaking facilities, trail widening, construction, and improvement, and the actual snowmaking
itself, would be located on National Forest System land operated under special use permit. Approval of these actions
which would occur on National Forest System lands requires Forest Service authorization under the Special Use Permit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Army permit program is authorized by section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, section
404 of the Clean Water Act, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. These laws require
permits authorizing activities in or affecting navigable waters of the United States, the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the United States, and the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping
it into ocean waters. The Corps must make a decision as to whether to issue a section 404 permit for activities associated
with the Mad River water withdrawal. These activities include water withdrawal structures, holding pond, access
road, and fill. The proposed water withdrawal site, storage pond, access road and most of the pipeline to the snowmaking
facility would be located on private lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several permits, certificates, or authorizations through the review processes established for the State of Vermont
are also required to implement the proposed action. The District Environmental Commission must issue permits under
the State of Vermont's Act 250 for various phases of the project. A 401 Certificate must be issued by the State Division
of Water Quality. A Dam Permit must be issued by the State Agency of Natural Resources. At this time, all permits or authorizations
required by the State of Vermont have been granted, except for one Act 250 permit to approve the trial improvements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until a Record of Decision based on this EIS is issued, the Sugarbush Ski Area will continue to be managed according
to the terms and conditions of the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain National Forest, the Master
Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, and the Special Use Permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action will be considered in the analysis. Reasonable alternatives
are those which fulfill the purpose and need for the proposals and address significant issues that are identified
during the scoping process. The analysis may include an evaluation of feasible alternative water sources or storage
sites which could be used either separately or in combination to meet snowmaking objectives while reducing or avoiding
impacts to the aquatic environment. Only one specific alternative to the proposed action has been identified at this
time. That is the ``no action'' alternative. If the ``no action'' alternative were selected, the proposed project
would not take place at this time. Other alternatives will be developed based on the results of scoping.

The analysis will address major issues and concerns about the proposed action and alternatives and will disclose
the direct and indirect impacts related to those issues. The following tentative issues have been identified: (1)
Impacts to wetlands and floodplains; (2) Impacts to waterways; (3) Impacts to cultural resource; (4) Impacts to streams
from increased snowpack and runoff; (5) Impacts to fisheries; (6) Effect on the suitability of the Mad River for inclusion
in the national system of Wild and Scenic Rivers; (7) Effect on recreation opportunities, specifically skiing and
winter sports at Sugarbush South; (8) Effects on visual quality, and (9) Impacts to the local economy.

The Draft Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and to
be available for public review in the summer of 1994. At that time, the Environmental Protection Agency will publish
a Notice of Availability in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection

The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the comment period ends on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the comments will be analyzed and considered
by the agency in preparing the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Final Environmental Impact Statement is scheduled to be completed and available to the public approximately
5 months following the close of the review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The responsible Forest
Service official will document the decision and the reasons supporting it in a Record of Decision. That decision will
be subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 215.

A separate decision will be made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concerning the issuance of permits under section

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recently passed North America Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act has amended the Rural Electrification
Act's ``Buy American'' provision. Previously, the provision required borrowers, when using loan funds, to purchase
only equipment that was manufactured in the United States and that was made mostly from materials and supplies originating
in the United States. The amended provision permits borrowers to also purchase equipment, under similar conditions,
from Canadian or Mexican manufacturers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law 103&hyph;182, (NAFTA Implementation Act)
was signed into law on December 8, 1993. Section 381 (d) of Subtitle G of Title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends
the REA ``Buy American'' provision established by Section 401 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 313,
318, 7 U.S.C. 901 et. seq., (1938 RE Act). The REA ``Buy American'' provision was revised by adding ``, Mexico, or Canada''
after every reference therein to the ``United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to its amendment by the NAFTA Implementation Act, the 1938 RE Act generally required borrowers, when using loan
funds, to purchase equipment that was manufactured in the United States that was made mostly from materials and supplies
originating in the United States. The NAFTA Implementation Act amendment of the 1938 RE Act takes effect on January
1, 1994. Generally speaking, after December 31, 1993, borrowers using funds from loans which have been made or guaranteed
by REA or the Rural Telephone Bank will be able to satisfy REA's ``Buy American'' provision by purchasing equipment
that has been manufactured in North America and made mostly of materials and supplies originating in North America,
i.e., in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REA ``Buy American'' provision as revised by the NAFTA Implementation Act reads as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In making loans pursuant to this title and pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, the Administrator of
Rural Electrification Administration shall require that, to the extent practicable and the cost of which is not unreasonable,
the borrower agree to use in connection with the expenditure of such funds only such unmanufactured articles, materials,
and supplies, as have been mined or produced in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and only such manufactured articles,
materials, and supplies as have been manufactured in the United States, Mexico, or Canada substantially all from
articles, materials or supplies, mined, produced, or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United States, Mexico,
or Canada.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amended provision applies to all procurements within REA's jurisdiction that commence after December 31, 1993,
which involve any REA, Rural Telephone Bank or guaranteed loan funds. REA is notifying borrowers, as well as Canadian
and Mexican manufacturers with current REA technically-accepted products, of this change in the REA ``Buy American''
provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA is also making technical revisions to its existing forms of loan contracts and loan contract amendments to conform
them to the 1938 RE Act as amended by NAFTA. REA will begin using these revised forms for all transactions entered into
after December 31, 1993. In addition, REA is making similar technical revisions to its recommended forms of contracts
providing for the purchase of materials and supplies. These changes will have no effect on any contract which is fully
in effect prior to January 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Eastern Distribution Center,
Inc., grantee of FTZ 24, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility
of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., (Merck) in Riverside, Pennsylvania. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions
of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part
400). It was formally filed on December 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Merck is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers with nearly $9 billion in total sales in 1991. Its
primary product lines include: Patented prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, veterinary
pharmaceuticals, and agricultural and specialty chemicals. This proposal is part of an overall company cost reduction
effort (subzone status is being requested for seven other Merck facilities).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Merck's Riverside plant (364 acres, 650,000 sq. ft., 68 bldgs.) is located at First Street and Avenue C in Riverside
(Northumberland County), Pennsylvania, some 60 miles southwest of Scranton. The facility (560 employees) is used
to produce bulk pharmaceutical chemicals and intermediates used at other Merck plants in the manufacture of human
and animal health products, agricultural chemicals (including ``Avermectin'' and ``Ethopabate''), and industrial
chemicals. At the outset, zone procedures would be used primarily in the production of ``Primaxin'', a broad spectrum
antibiotic produced for the company's Human Health Division. Currently, foreign-sourced materials account for
33 to 43 percent of finished product value and include the following specific ingredients: Acetoxy azetidinone,
HP&hyph;20 resin dianon, SP&hyph;207 (brominated polystyrine resin), bromochloropentane, and D-carboxamide.
The company also may purchase from abroad items in the following general product categories: Gums, starches, waxes,
vegetable extracts, mineral oils, phosphoric acid, hydroxides, hydrazine and hydroxylamine, chlorides, phosphates,
carbonates, hydrocarbons, alcohols, phenols, ethers, epoxides, acetals, aldehydes, ketone function compounds,
mono- and polycarboxylic acids, phosphoric esters, amine-, carboxymide, nitrile- and oxygen-function compounds,
heterocyclic compounds, sulfonamides, vitamins, hormones, sugars, antibiotics, gelatins, enzymes, color lakes,
soaps and detergents, medicaments, and pharmaceutical products. The company may also source from abroad insecticides,
rodenticides, fungicides, and herbicides for use in its agricultural/veterinary products. Currently, exports
account for some 40 percent of production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zone procedures would exempt Merck from Customs duty payments on foreign materials used in production for export.
On domestic sales, the company would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to the finished products (``Primaxin''_3.7%;
others_duty-free to 23.5%). The duty rates on foreign-sourced items range from duty-free to 23.5 percent, with most
falling in the 3.7%&hyph;7.9% range. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures will help improve
the plant's international competitiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate
the application and report to the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the
Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is March 7, 1994. Rebuttal
comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day

FINAL DETERMINATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
We determine that ferrosilicon (FeSi) from Brazil is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than
fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that critical circumstances
exist for Italmagnesio S.A. Industria e Comercio (Italmagnesio), but not for Companhia Ferroligas Minas Gerais
(Minasligas) or Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension
of Liquidation'' section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise subject to this investigation is ferrosilicon, a ferroalloy generally containing, by weight, not
less than four percent iron, more than eight percent but not more than 96 percent silicon, not more than 10 percent chromium,
not more than 30 percent manganese, not more than three percent phosphorous, less than 2.75 percent magnesium, and
not more than 10 percent calcium or any other element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi is a ferroalloy produced by combining silicon and iron through smelting in a submerged-arc furnace. FeSi is used
primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer
and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi is differentiated by size and by grade. The sizes express the maximum and minimum dimensions of the lumps of FeSi
found in a given shipment. FeSi grades are defined by the percentages by weight of contained silicon and other minor
elements. FeSi is most commonly sold to the iron and steel industries in standard grades of 75 percent and 50 percent
FeSi. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calcium silicon, ferrocalcium silicon, and magnesium ferrosilicon are specifically excluded from the scope of
this investigation. Calcium silicon is an alloy containing, by weight, not more than five percent iron, 60 to 65 percent
silicon, and 28 to 32 percent calcium. Ferrocalcium silicon is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four
percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and more than 10 percent calcium. Magnesium ferrosilicon is a ferroalloy containing,
by weight, not less than four percent iron, not more than 55 percent silicon, and not less than 2.75 percent magnesium.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi is currently classifiable under the following subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS): 7202.21.1000, 7202.21.5000, 7202.21.7500, 7202.21.9000, 7202.29.0010, and 7202.29.0050. Although
the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of
this investigation is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi in the form of slag is included within the scope of this investigation if it meets, generally, the chemical content
definition stated above and is capable of being used as FeSi. FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production
of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers
as an inoculant. Parties that believe their importations of slag do not meet these definitions should contact the
Department and request a scope determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the publication of the notice of preliminary determination on August 16, 1993 (58 FR 43323), the following events
have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 20, 1993, respondent Italmagnesio notified the Department that it had decided to withdraw from participation
in this investigation and requested the return of all documents that it submitted during the course of the investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 25, 1993, we returned the proprietary versions of all documents submitted by Italmagnesio during the investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 23, 24, and 25, 1993, CBCC, petitioners, and Minasligas, respectively, requested a public hearing.

As stated in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, Italmagnesio withdrew its responses prior to verification
and stated that it would not participate further in the investigation. Therefore, Italmagnesio must be considered
a non-cooperating party. As a non-cooperating party, based on our past practice (

We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we compared
similar merchandise based on the following criteria: (1) The percentage range, by weight, of silicon content; (2)
grade; and (3) sieve size. (See Comment 2 with regard to sieve size.)

We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and exporter's sales price was not indicated by
other circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated purchase price based on packed FOB port of embarkation prices to unrelated customers. Because CBCC
did not report packing for bulk sales, we used information from the public version of Minasligas' response for bulk
packing. We made deductions where appropriate for foreign inland freight (which also included foreign inland insurance),
foreign brokerage and handling, and warehousing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales.

The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal-Mogul
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision, and has applied this new methodology in making the final determination in this investigation. From now
on, the Department will add to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United States
merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales.
The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments will
deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are included
in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise
price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments
to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent the new methodology for calculating
the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied
upon foreign market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses than the
price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP.

In this investigation, there are four different taxes levied on sales of the subject merchandise in the home market.
The ICMS tax is a regional tax, which varies depending upon the state in which the purchase originates. The IPI tax is
a fixed percentage rate tax of four percent. Finally, the PIS and FINSOCIAL taxes are a fixed percentage rate tax equalling
2.65 percent combined. CBCC used both a unit and a gross basis to calculate the combined PIS and FINSOCIAL taxes within
various months of the POI. We recalculated these taxes on a unit basis, where appropriate, which is the way CBCC calculated
them. Because these taxes are calculated on the same base price, we find them not to be cascading. Thus, for each sale,
we made only one tax adjustment which equals the sum of the actual tax rates.

In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of FeSi in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of FeSi to the aggregate volume of third country sales in accordance
with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. For both CBCC and Minasligas, the volume of home market sales was greater than
five percent of the aggregate volume of third country sales. Therefore, for both CBCC and Minasligas, we determined
that home market sales of FeSi constituted a viable basis for calculating FMV, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48(a).

In the petition and in subsequent filings, petitioners alleged that home market sales were made at less than the cost
of production (COP) and that constructed value (CV) should be used to compute FMV. Based on petitioners' allegations,
which provided a reasonable basis to ``believe or suspect'' below cost sales (see section 773(b) of the ACT), we initiated
COP investigations. We examined respondents' cost data at verification and analyzed this information for purposes
of this final determination.

In order to determine whether home market sales were above the COP, we calculated the monthly COPs on the basis of CBCC's
cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and packing. We relied on the COP data submitted by CBCC except
in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. Specifically, we: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Revised general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses by calculating them as a percentage of cost of goods sold

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We compared individual home market prices with the monthly COPs. We tested the home market prices on a sieve-size-specific
basis and found, for all sieve sizes, that between 10 and 90 percent of sales in the home market were made at prices above
the COP. Therefore, we disregarded the below-cost sales, if those sales were made over an extended period of time.
CBCC did not provide any information in its responses to indicate that its below cost sales were made at prices which
would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. In order to determine
whether below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following analysis on a product-specific
basis: (1) If respondent sold a product in only one month of the POI and there were sales in that month below the COP, or
(2) if respondent sold a product during two months or more of the POI and there were sales below the COP during two or more
of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended period of time. All of CBCC's
sales were made over an extended period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For CBCC, we based FMV on home market prices. However, for one U.S. sale, although there were comparable home market
sales in the same month, we were unable to make a difference-in-merchandise (DIFMER) adjustment. This is because
the U.S. product was produced in a month different than the home market products and in hyperinflationary economies,
we limit such adjustments to products produced and sold in the same month. In that instance, we used CV as FMV.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e)(1) of the Act. The monthly CV includes materials, fabrication,
general expenses, profit and packing. We made all adjustments described in the COP section (except for the inclusion
of ICMS and IPI taxes in material costs) in calculating the CV. We used the following as the basis for calculating CV:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) CBCC's actual general expenses because they exceed the statutory ten percent minimum of materials and fabrication,
in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the statutory minimum profit of eight percent, in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, as CBCC's
profit was less than eight percent of the sum of general expenses and the cost of manufacture; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) we calculated an offset to interest expense to avoid double counting the portion of such expense attributable
to the imputed credit and inventory carrying costs which were already included in the selling, general and administrative
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a).
Finally, we added U.S. packing expenses to CV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For price-to-price comparisons, we based FMV on ex-factory prices, inclusive of packing, to unrelated customers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We deducted foreign inland freight from FMV. We made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for
differences in credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). Because the home market credit figure reported
by CBCC is actually interest revenue, we imputed credit expense and then applied the interest revenue as an offset
against the imputed expense. We also used the actual paydates found at verification in our credit expense calculation.
For those sales which we did not examine at verification, we added the average difference between the paydate reported
and the actual paydate from the verified sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For FeSi sales packed in bags, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. Because CBCC did
not report packing for bulk sales, we used information on bulk packing costs from the public version of Minasligas'
response for these sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included in the FMV the amount of taxes collected in the home market. We also calculated the amount of the tax that
was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (i.e., the sum of any amounts that were deducted
from the tax base). This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been made. By
making the additional tax adjustments, we avoid a distortion that would create a dumping margin even when pre-tax
dumping is zero.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We compared individual home market prices with the monthly COPs. We tested the home market prices on a sieve-size-specific
basis and found, for certain sieve sizes, that between 10 and 90 percent of sales of each in the home market were made
at prices above the COP. Therefore, we disregarded the below-cost sales for those sieve sizes, if those sales were
made over an extended period of time. Minasligas did not provide any information in its responses to indicate that
its below cost sales were made at prices which would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time

to have been made over an extended period of time. All of Minasligas' below cost sales were made over an extended period
of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Minasligas, we based FMV on home market prices. We calculated FMV based on ex-factory prices, inclusive of packing,
to unrelated customers. We deducted foreign inland freight from FMV. We made circumstance-of-sale adjustments,
where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). Because the home market
credit figure reported by Minasligas is actually interest revenue, we imputed credit expense and then used the interest
revenue as an offset against the imputed expense. We imputed U.S. credit because Minasligas did not report this expense.
We used the ``First Payment'' date reported by Minasligas and the monthly interest rates based on the ``Taxa Referential''
which is the Brazilian Government's referential index for short-term borrowings. We also made circumstance-of-sale
adjustments, where appropriate, for direct selling expenses (finance charges), warehousing, and quality control
expenses. We reallocated a portion of direct selling expenses to foreign brokerage and handling based on findings
at verification. Finally, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included in FMV the amount of taxes collected in the home market. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was
due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (i.e., the sum of any adjustments that were
deducted from the tax base). This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been
made. By making the additional tax adjustments, we avoid a distortion that would create a dumping margin even when

Critical Circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of FeSi from Brazil. Section 735(a)(3)
of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determine that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) (i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding (A)(i) above, we normally consider whether there has been an antidumping order in the United States or elsewhere
on the subject merchandise in determining whether there is a history of dumping. Regarding (A)(ii) above, we normally
consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price comparisons and 15 percent or more for exporter's sales price
comparisons as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have
been massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable);
and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. If imports during the period immediately following
the filing of a petition increase by at least 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately preceding
the filing of a petition, we normally consider them massive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the calculated dumping margins for CBCC and Minasligas are not in excess of 25 percent, we cannot impute knowledge
under section 735(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act. (See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value; Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or
Unfinished, from Italy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987.) Petitioners provided information regarding respondent's history of dumping in a third
country. Therefore, we examined whether imports have been massive. Based on our analysis of verified company specific
import data, we determined that imports have not been massive over a relatively short period of time for CBCC and Minasligas.
Accordingly, we determine that critical circumstances do not exist for CBCC and Minasligas. However, for Italmagnesio,
a non-cooperative respondent, based on BIA we determine that critical circumstances exist. In the case of Italmagnesio,
the margin in excess of 25 percent is high enough to impute knowledge of dumping and, as BIA, we concluded that imports
have been massive over a relatively short period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we found that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to all cooperative respondents, we also find
that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to all other exporters and producers of the subject merchandise
from Brazil, except for Italmagnesio.

and selection of original source documentation containing relevant information.

No certified rates of exchange, as furnished by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were available for the POI. In
place of the official certified rates, we used the daily official exchange rates for the Brazilian currency published
by the Central Bank of Brazil. In the instances when a post-POI exchange rate was required, we used a monthly average
exchange rate from International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics.

In hyperinflationary economies, the Department normally converts movement charges for the U.S. sales on the date
these charges become payable. Where we did not have the exact payment date for a charge, we converted charges for U.S.
sales on the date of shipment, the closest approximation to the date the charges became payable. For two of CBCC's U.S.
sales, it was necessary to convert the bulk packing charges on the date of sale as we did not have a bulk packing rate in
the month of shipment for those U.S. sales. Thus, for these two sales we converted the packing charges in the same month
in which the U.S. sales occurred.

Comment 1:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that, based on the facts now available to the Department, the dumping margins established in the
preliminary determination are inadequate to offset the actual dumping margin of Brazilian FeSi producers. In addition,
petitioners believe that at verification the Department confirmed the existence of major, continuing deficiencies
in respondents' information. Accordingly, petitioners contend that the Department should assign the highest,
most adverse margin based on noncooperative BIA to both CBCC and Minasligas.

DOC Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree with petitioners. CBCC and Minasligas' mistakes, found during the course of this investigation, when
taken as a whole, do not represent a verification failure and do not support a claim of respondents' noncooperation.
The minor errors in calculation or discrepancies with regard to adoption of certain methodological premises do not
merit the use of BIA. Therefore, we have followed our practice of correcting errors found at verification as long as
those errors are minor and do not exhibit a pattern of systemic misstatement of fact. Thus, we are able to use the data
submitted by CBCC and Minasligas, corrected for errors noted at verification, in our calculations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that the Department should use the highest, most adverse noncooperative BIA rate for CBCC and Minasligas
since they both repeatedly failed to provide the Department with the accurate sieve size and silicon content of the
FeSi they sold. Petitioners maintain that CBCC's August 17, 1993, letter contained information about silicon content
and sieve size known to be inaccurate. Petitioners contend that accurate information was clearly available to CBCC
and the fact that it was not provided prevented the Department from making such or similar comparisons in the final
determination, as required by the Act. Similarly, petitioners note that Minasligas, in its August 25, 1993, revised
product concordance, failed to provide the exact silicon content and sieve size of its home market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC believes that the Department incorrectly based its preliminary determination on BIA because of the alleged
failure by CBCC to provide a proper product concordance. CBCC states that it cannot fabricate a product concordance
to the level of sieve size, which was requested by the Department, because there is no difference in product between
sieve sizes. CBCC argues that the Department verified that sieve size is irrelevant in terms of the cost and the price
and, thus, any DIFMER would be zero. CBCC maintains that based on the information submitted and the production processes
observed at verification, the Department should use CBCC's information as the basis for the final determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, Minasligas maintains that sieve size does not impact cost or price of FeSi and should not be considered
a factor for product comparison purposes. With respect to providing information on exact silicon content, Minasligas
contends that the ASTM standard specifications for FeSi 75 percent under grade C provide for a product containing
between 74 percent and 79 percent of silicon. Minasligas argues that since all of its FeSi sales are of FeSi 75 percent

 We agree with respondents. We determine that Minasligas provided a unique code for each sieve size for each sale during
the POI, in accordance with directions in Appendix V. We used Minasligas' product matching method for purposes of
margin calculation; however, we rematched in a few instances where we disagreed with their selection. We based matching
on home market sales with sieve size ranges which were closest to the sieve size range of the U.S. product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also determine that CBCC reported sieve sizes in accordance with Appendix V. The sieve size ranges reported by CBCC
were broader than those reported by Minasligas and were broader than the ranges observed on CBCC's individual home
market sales. Nevertheless, these ranges do allow us to match within the closest sieve size range, as specified in
Appendix V. Moreover, these broad ranges are consistent with CBCC's selling practices. CBCC stated on the record
that it fills customer orders with the broadest range of possible sieve sizes. Therefore, we accepted CBCC's revised
coding system, and matched home market sales with all possible sieve sizes, including those that may extend beyond
the sieve size range of the U.S. product because this corresponds to CBCC's selling practices. We excluded from FMV
only those home market sales where the sieve size ranges are entirely outside the sieve size range of the U.S. sale in
question. (See Concurrence Memorandum dated December 29, 1993.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners claim that both CBCC and Minasligas failed to report their respective interest expenses on a consolidated
basis for the purposes of calculating COP in accordance with Department practice. Petitioners argue that CBCC's
refusal to provide this information prevented the Department from verifying these expenses. Accordingly, petitioners
state that the Department should use adverse, ``noncooperative BIA'' in calculating interest expense for CBCC.
However, in the event that the Department does not use ``noncooperative BIA,'' petitioners suggest that the Department
use Solvay do Brasil's audited financial statements to calculate interest expense for the purposes of calculating
CBCC's COP and CV. Similarly, petitioners contend that the Department should allocate interest expense to Minasligas'
COP based on Delp's (Minasligas' parent company) 1992 audited financial statements as a percentage of cost of goods
sold, without allowance for a short-term interest income offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC argues that the Department should use its non-consolidated income statement, rather than the corporate consolidated
figure, to compute net interest expense. CBCC claims that the advances of funds from subsidiary to parent were the
reverse of those normally seen by the Department and were not ``interest free''. CBCC further argues that without
CBCC, Solvay do Brasil would have had to borrow funds in the commercial market. Thus, CBCC suggests that the Department
should increase CBCC's financial receipts by an imputed interest on the interest free loans that CBCC made to its parent.
With regard to petitioners' allegation that CBCC refused to provide the Department with Solvay do Brasil's financial
statement, CBCC explains that the Department requested an additional copy of the translated financial statement,
previously submitted to the Department on June 10, 1993, which the company was unable to provide at verification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas contends that its financial statements are not consolidated with Delp's statements. Minasligas maintains
that there is no borrowing relationship between Delp and Minasligas, and further, there is no evidence of control
by Delp over borrowings by Minasligas. Minasligas, therefore, believes it is inappropriate to substitute Delp's
interest expenses for that of Minasligas. Minasligas asserts that it correctly reduced its submitted unconsolidated
interest expenses by various forms of short-term financial income, including capital gains, exchange rate gains,
discounts, and monetary correction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners that CBCC and Minasligas should report interest expense on a consolidated basis. The Department's
position is that the cost of capital is fungible, therefore, calculating interest expense based on consolidated
statements is the most appropriate methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the cost verification report of CBCC, we noted that CBCC and Solvay do Brasil rely on intercompany interest-free
borrowing to meet their working capital requirements. In addition, in order to extinguish its outstanding debt,
CBCC issued new shares of capital stock to its parent company. After establishing at verification that CBCC and Solvay
do Brasil have significant financial transactions with each other, we requested information documenting financial
expense at the Solvay do Brasil level. Company officials refused to provide any data. Therefore, we have based financial
expense for CBCC using BIA. As BIA, we used information from Solvay do Brasil's financial statements (exhibit B; June
10, 1993, questionnaire response). This percentage was then applied to each month's COM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of Minasligas, Delp does not consolidate its accounts with Minasligas. In addition, because there are
no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies, we combined the financial expenses of the two
companies, effectively creating consolidated accounts. Regarding the offset claimed by Minasligas, the Department
only allows income generated from investments of working capital which the company documents as short-term in nature.
Minasligas was able to substantiate only a portion of the investments to be short-term; consequently, we have allowed
only the documented portion of interest income as an offset. We did not allow an offset to Minasligas' parent, Delp,
for interest expense because the information required to substantiate such an adjustment is not contained in the
record of this investigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners maintain that CBCC and Minasligas failed to follow the Department's established practice for allocating
G&amp;A expenses. Petitioners make the same allegation with regard to CBCC's selling expenses. Petitioners claim
that G&amp;A expenses are period costs that should be allocated based on the ratio of total annual G&amp;A expenses
over total annual costs of goods sold. Selling expenses should be allocated similarly. However, petitioners state
that CBCC allocated G&amp;A and selling expenses to individual products, using the ratio of each separate product's
cost of goods sold. Minasligas allocated POI G&amp;A expenses on a monthly basis. For purposes of the final determination,
petitioners believe that the Department should reallocate these expenses following its established practice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC argues that the Department should not use the ratio of expenses to cost of goods sold as an estimate of G&amp;A expenses.
CBCC believes that the monthly expenses accurately reflect, on a replacement cost basis, the expenses for the company
in that month and are the most appropriate figures to use. CBCC claims that the petitioners are urging the Department
to use a methodology that the Court of International Trade specifically invalidated as susceptible to overstating
the effects of inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas agrees that G&amp;A expenses are period costs, but maintains that an annual calculation based on cost
of sales is problematic because the annual G&amp;A expense and the annual cost of sales are conglomerations of monthly
expenses which have not been adjusted for inflation. Minasligas believes the Department should calculate G&amp;A
rates based on monthly averages or a simple average G&amp;A rate.

We agree with petitioners in part. G&amp;A expenses are period expenses which are normally measured over a fiscal
year. As such, the Department calculates G&amp;A on an annual basis. To calculate G&amp;A for a lesser period may exclude
certain expenses, which is distortive. Therefore, we recalculated G&amp;A expenses on an annual historical basis
for both companies and, in order to avoid overstating G&amp;A expenses and neutralize hyperinflationary effects,
we applied the G&amp;A ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis. We also revised CBCC's reported
G&amp;A to include a portion of Solvay do Brasil's G&amp;A, which CBCC had failed to include in its reported costs.
Moreover, we calculated CBCC's selling expense portion of SG&amp;A based on sales of the same class or kind of merchandise
according to our normal practice.

Petitioners contend that the Department should include ICMS and IPI taxes in CBCC's and Minasligas' reported materials
costs in applying the Department's sales-below-cost test. Petitioners state that Department practice is to perform
the sales-below-cost test on a tax-inclusive basis, with the COP and home market prices containing the same absolute
amount of taxes. With regard to CV, petitioners contend that the Department has previously determined that ICMS and
other domestic taxes are not remitted or refunded upon exportation and consequently have to be included in CV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC submits that the Department should not include the ICMS and IPI taxes in its COP and CV calculations. CBCC states
that the Department reviewed CBCC's records at verification showing that CBCC's payments of ICMS offset any amount
owed by virtue of its receipts of ICMS. Thus, CBCC claims that the ``cost of materials'' does not include any ICMS or
IPI value, because CBCC always receives a tax credit for these payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas argues that in determining whether home market sales are above the cost of production, the Department
must either include ICMS and IPI in the cost of production and in the sales price to the domestic market or exclude them
from both sides to avoid double counting. Minasligas further argues that these taxes should not be included in calculations
of CV because they are offset against the amounts collected from the domestic market sales.

We agree with petitioners in part. For our test of home market sales below cost we have included the same amount of domestic
taxes in the COP and the domestic sales prices. However, when using CV as a surrogate for home market prices we must determine
if in fact the entity under investigation is able to recover all of the taxes paid on inputs (raw materials) from its
domestic sales of subject merchandise. If domestic sales of subject merchandise fully recover all of the domestic
taxes paid on inputs, then these taxes would appropriately be excluded from the margin analysis. However, if the producer
is not able to recover all input taxes from its sales of subject merchandise, then these actual costs must be reflected
in the CV. (See

We have determined that CBCC's domestic sales of subject merchandise fully recover all input taxes incurred to produce
the subject merchandise sold in both the domestic and export markets. We have excluded the domestic tax amounts from

the government.

Petitioners claim that CBCC did not accurately report its charcoal replacement costs. They further argue that CBCC
did not provide the Department with the additional documentation requested regarding the estimated harvest of wood
and other assumptions used in the calculation of the amortization costs for charcoal production. Petitioners argue
that by not providing this information, CBCC prevented the Department from verifying the accuracy of the cost data
and CBCC did not comply with Department practice in reporting replacement costs for company-produced charcoal.
Therefore, petitioners state that the Department should assign a noncooperative BIA rate to CBCC. Alternatively,
petitioners suggest that the Department adjust CBCC's reported cost for company-produced charcoal upward to the
level of CBCC's cost for purchasing charcoal from unrelated suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC argues that since charcoal accounts for less than three percent of the cost of production of FeSi, use of BIA because
of the difficulty encountered with verifying the accuracy of this factor of production would be totally inappropriate.
CBCC maintains that should the Department make any adjustments to the charcoal costs it should only adjust the figures
with the information gathered at verification rather than disregard the entire response.

We agree with petitioners that we should adjust CBCC's charcoal replacement costs; however, we disagree that CBCC
was noncooperative and should receive a margin based solely upon BIA. We discovered errors made by CBCC in calculating
its cost of producing charcoal, a primary raw material, used in the production of FeSi. CBCC substantially understated
its cost of producing charcoal by inaccurately recording the costs associated with their wood forests which provide
the raw material needed to produce charcoal. Therefore, we have recalculated the cost of CBCC's production of charcoal.
As suggested by petitioners, we relied upon the actual weighted-average monthly cost CBCC was charged by unrelated
vendors.

Petitioners claim that CBCC incorrectly accelerated the depreciation on a particular furnace by five years. The
result was a disproportionate allocation of costs to products manufactured during the first five years the furnace
was put into service, as opposed to the second five years, when no depreciation was reported. Petitioners contend
that the accelerated depreciation for this furnace was an abnormal event since CBCC returned to its normal ten-year
useful life for furnace depreciation following the period of accelerated depreciation. Petitioners further argue
that the Department has explicitly rejected the accelerated depreciation of assets where such accelerated depreciation
was not based on the useful life of the assets. Accordingly, petitioners believe that the depreciation charges for
this furnace should be recalculated to reflect the company's normal ten-year useful life for furnace depreciation.

CBCC contends that it would be improper for the Department to allocate all of CBCC's depreciation expenses on all furnaces
to FeSi production. Although theoretically, any one furnace could be used to produce any of the products that CBCC
sells, this does not make the furnaces fungible. The Department's determination should not be based on what could
theoretically be produced in a furnace, but rather what was actually produced in each furnace. Regardless, if the
Department considers the furnaces fungible, this would result in a lowering of CBCC's depreciation expense as furnaces
one through six are fully depreciated.

CBCC maintains that the Department verified that only the month of October contained an error of 5.7 percent with respect

 Petitioners claim that Minasligas inappropriately allocated its labor and overhead costs between subject and non-subject
merchandise based on number of furnaces, rather than actual production during the POI. Therefore, petitioners request
that the Department adjust Minasligas' submitted costs accordingly.

DOC Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners that number of furnaces is not an adequate basis for allocating labor or other fabrication
costs. Number of furnaces is an arbitrary measure, which does not necessarily reflect the actual level of labor and
overhead expended in the production of the subject merchandise. In the instant case, output tons is a more accurate
allocation basis. Therefore, we have revised the submitted costs to reflect an allocation based on actual production
units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that Italmagnesio failed to cooperate with the Department by withdrawing from the investigation
and should receive the highest, most adverse BIA rate on the record. Petitioners further argue that BIA includes the
rates alleged in the petition, as corrected for clerical errors, and the rates alleged in petitioners' amended allegation
of sales below cost for Italmagnesio. Petitioners disagree with the Department's decision in the preliminary determination
which rejected the revised margin calculations in petitioners' amended sales-below-cost allegation as a source
of BIA; the Department rejected the revisions on the grounds that petitioners based the revisions on information
submitted by Italmagnesio. Petitioners state that their amended allegation relied not on financial statements
submitted by Italmagnesio but on identical financial statements that petitioners had obtained independently prior
to the date of Italmagnesio's submission of the information. In addition, petitioners assert that Italmagnesio
withdrew from the investigation after the Department indicated in the preliminary determination that it would not
use the higher rates in petitioners' amended allegation as BIA. Therefore, petitioners maintain that not using the
amended allegation as BIA would allow Italmagnesio to control the outcome of the investigation.

DOC Position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For this final determination, we assigned Italmagnesio a margin in accordance with the two-tiered BIA methodology
under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon those respondents who refuse to cooperate or otherwise
significantly impede the proceeding. In our BIA margin analysis, we utilized information contained in petitioners'
amended COP allegation for Italmagnesio. Although Department policy does not allow petitioners to use questionnaire
responses in a piece-meal manner in order to increase margins in the petition that may later be used as BIA, our analysis
revealed that petitioners had access to Italmagnesio's financial statements prior to the submission of this information
on the record by Italmagnesio.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 735(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to retroactively
suspend liquidation of all entries of FeSi from Italmagnesio. Retroactive suspension applies to entries of FeSi,
that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 18, 1993, which is the date 90 days prior
to the date of the publication of our preliminary determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We are also directing the Customs Service to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation with regard to
CBCC, and ``All Other Exporters'' entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption between May 18, 1993, and
August 16, 1993, which is the date of our preliminary determination, and to release any bond or other security, and
refund any cash deposit with respect to these entries during that period in accordance with section 735(c)(3). For
CBCC and ``All Other Exporters'', we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of FeSi
from Brazil, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 16, 1993. Finally,
since the Department finds that no final dumping margin exists with respect to Minasligas, we are directing the Customs
Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation for entries of FeSi from Minasligas, and to release any bond or
other security, and refund any cash deposit with respect to these entries from Minasligas in accordance with section
735(c)(2) of the statute. However, if the Department has reasonable cause to believe or suspect at any time during
the existence of the antidumping duty order that Minasligas has sold or is likely to sell the subject merchandise to
the United States at less than its foreign market value, then the Department may institute an administrative review
of Minasligas under section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which the
FMV of the subject merchandise exceeds the USP as shown below.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a request from the petitioner, Flowline Division of Markovitz Enterprises, Inc. (Flowline), the Department
of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain stainless
steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings (SSPFs) from Japan. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter, Benkan
Corporation (Benkan), and exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period from March 1,
1992, through February 28, 1993. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for the period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference
between the United States price (USP) and foreign market value (FMV). Interested parties are invited to comment on
these preliminary results.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 12, 1993, the Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' (58 FR
13583) of the antidumping duty order on SSPFs from Japan (53 FR 9787). On March 29, 1993, Flowline requested an administrative
review. The Department initiated the review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960), covering the period March 1, 1992, through
February 28, 1993. The Department has now conducted this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of
1930, as amended (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this review include certain stainless steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings. These fittings
are used in piping systems for chemical plants, pharmaceutical plants, food processing facilities, waste treatment
facilities, semiconductor equipment applications, nuclear power plants, and other areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 7307.23.0000.
The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written product description remains dispositive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This review covers sales and entries by Benkan of the subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merchandise during the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Benkan, pursuant to section 771(16) of the Act, the Department established the following criteria for matching
sales in the home and U.S. markets: Type of fitting, seam condition, steel material grade, unit product weight within
10 percent, nominal pipe size, and wall thickness. An identical pipe is one that matches all of these criteria. A similar
pipe is one that has one or more differences in these discrete criteria from the U.S. fitting other than the type of fitting,
seam condition, and unit product weight within 10 percent. The 10 percent variance in unit product weight reflects
our prior practice in this case which was based upon allowable deviations between Japanese and U.S. industry standards.
The Department established this hierarchy of criteria after soliciting comments from Flowline and Benkan at the
beginning of the 1992&hyph;1993 review period. Both Flowline and Benkan agreed on the criteria and their hierarchy.

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating USP, the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because the merchandise
was sold to an unrelated purchaser in the United States prior to its importation and exporter's sales price was not
indicated by other circumstances. The Department based USP on the packed, delivered price to those unrelated purchasers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that the date of sale for this merchandise is the invoice date because the invoice always
sets forth agreed prices and quantities and represents the first transactional document which systematically records
agreed prices. The Department made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, U.S. inland freight,
U.S. duties, U.S. brokerage fees, ocean freight, marine insurance, foreign brokerage fees, and discounts.

the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to the foreign market sales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal-Mogul
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision. The Department will add to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the merchandise
sold in the United States at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign
market sales. The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustments and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments
will deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are
included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise
price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments
to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating
the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied
upon foreign market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses than the
price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating FMV, we used home market price, as defined in section 773(a) of the Act. Home market price was based on
a packed, delivered price to unrelated purchasers in the home market. In accordance with section 353.45 of the Department's
regulations, the Department has excluded sales to related parties because the respondent has failed to provide sufficient
evidence to support its claim that sales to related parties were at arm's-length. The Department made adjustments,
where applicable, for inland freight, discounts, rebates, and for differences in packing material, packing labor,
and credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also made an adjustment to FMV for imputed consumption taxes in accordance with the aforementioned

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, where similar home market sales were used due to the absence of an identical sale, we made a difference-in-merchandise
adjustment. The Department based the difference-in-merchandise adjustment on differences in steel pipe materials
cost between U.S. and home market merchandise (see the Department's preliminary analysis memo dated December 29,
1993). When there were no contemporaneous such or similar sales, we based FMV on constructed value. Constructed value
data for specific models was provided by Benkan at the request of the Department. Benkan did not provide constructed
value information for two models as requested by the Department. For these preliminary results the Department has
applied to applicable sales of these two models an antidumping duty margin of 8.05967 percent which is the weighted
average margin for sales of SSPFs by Benkan for this review. The Department will request for the final results of this
review that Benkan provide constructed value data for these two models.

Preliminary Results of Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of our comparison of USP to FMV, the Department preliminarily determines that a margin of 8.06 percent exists
for Benkan for the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may request a
hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication
of this notice, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may
be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments,
limited to the issues raised in the case briefs and comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication.
The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis
of any such written comments or hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall determine, and U.S. Customs shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual
differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions directly to Customs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company

manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in a previous review or the original less-than-fair-value
(LTFV) investigation, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the rate published in the most recent final results
or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is
not a firm covered in this review, earlier reviews, or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash
deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in these final results of review, earlier
reviews, or the original investigation, whichever is the most recent; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will be 49.31
percent, as explained below.

, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. Accordingly,
the cash deposit rate for any future entries from all other manufacturers or exporters, who are not covered in this
or prior administrative reviews and who are unrelated to the reviewed firms or any previously reviewed firm, will
be the ``all others'' rate established in the original LTFV investigation which is 49.31 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The panel issued an order and memorandum on December 23, 1993, as follows: ``These are appeals from two affirmative
final dumping determinations issued by the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce (ITA)
involving, respectively, cold-and-hot rolled carbon steel flat products imported into the United States from Canada.
The International Trade Commission (ITC) rendered final negative determinations in both cases on the issue of material
injury; these negative injury determinations have been appealed to the Court of International Trade (CIT).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ITA has moved in each case to stay the proceedings before this panel pending final resolution of the injury question
now before the CIT. The ITA argues that until such final judicial action an unconstitutional exercise of power for
this panel to proceed. Four complaining parties in each case (respondents below) support the issuance of the requested
stay. The complaining U.S. domestic interests (who also appeal here, claiming that the dumping margins found by ITA
are too low) have taken no position on the ITA motion. The Government of Canada takes no position on the ITA motion in
No. 01 and consent to issuance of a stay in No. 02 but does not endorse the ITA's constitutional argument in either case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cold-rolled case (No. 01), a fifth complaining respondent, Sidbec-Dosco, Inc. (SDI), opposes the ITA motion
and itself moves for a stay, which it would seek to have lifted in the event the CIT remands the injury issue to the ITC
for further proceedings. SDI regards the Panel as having power to go forward with this proceeding, whether or not there
has been a final resolution of the injury question elsewhere.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the present juncture, no party contends either that we cannot or should not grant a stay. It is evident that if the
ITC's negative determination is affirmed by the courts any effort expended here will have been wasted. We agree with
all the parties who have addressed the point that, in these circumstances, considerations of economy and efficiency
should predominate. We do not regard the procedural timetable laid down in the Free Trade Agreement and the implementing
measures as a jurisdictional limitation. Accordingly, we grant a stay in each case, subject to further consideration
on motion by any party or by the Panel if and when circumstances warrant, and terminating in each case at the latest upon
the conclusion of the proceedings for review of the corresponding injury determination. In staying these proceedings,
we express no opinion as to the merits of the constitutional argument advanced by ITA. Leave is granted to any party
to move later to lift the stay if and when they regard the circumstances as propitious.

Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Director of the Information Resources
Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior to submission
of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following: (1) Type
of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection;
(4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public
comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Cary Green at the address specified
above.

Federal Grants, Federal Student Financial Aid Programs section 401(b)(8) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as
amended, requires that incarcerated students shall only be awarded a Federal Pell Grant in a state if the grants are
used to supplement and not supplant the level of postsecondary educational assistance provided by that state to incarcerated
individuals. The Annual State Report on Postsecondary Educational Assistance Provided To Incarcerated Students
will be used to collect this information.

December 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for relicense of the existing Salida
Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 2275&hyph;001. The project is located on the South Arkansas River and on Fooses Creek
in Chaffee County, Colorado, and occupies lands within the San Isabel National Forest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA)
on this hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.

Scoping Meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two scoping meetings will be conducted on January 27, 1994. A scoping meeting oriented towards the agencies will be
conducted at 10 a.m. at the Salida Ranger District office, 325 West Rainbow Boulevard, Salida, Colorado. A scoping
meeting oriented towards the public will be conducted at 7 p.m. at the Chaffee County Courthouse, Commissioners Meeting
Room, 142 Crestone Street, Salida, Colorado. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and assist the
staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help focus discussions at the meetings, a scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA will
be mailed to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the scoping document will also
be available at the scoping meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the scoping meetings the FERC staff will: (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed
project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3)
identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EA; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the
staff's preliminary views.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 122(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``CERCLA''), notice is hereby given that a proposed
administrative cost recovery settlement concerning the Martin Marietta site in Waterton, Colorado was signed by
the EPA Regional Administrator, Region VIII, and issued by the Agency on July 2, 1993. The settlement resolves an EPA
claim under section 107 of CERCLA against the Martin Marietta Corporation (``MMC''). By the terms of the proposed
Agreement, MMC will pay $875,592.92 to EPA to settle its liability for remaining Past Response Costs. In return, the
United States will provide MMC with a covenant not to sue limited to claims for civil liability to the United States
arising out of section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), for reimbursement of the United States' Past Response
Costs. ``Past Response Costs'' are defined in the Agreement as any and all response costs, including oversight costs,
incurred by the United States in responding to the release or threat of release of hazardous substances from the Site
pursuant to CERCLA prior to and including the effective date of the Agreement, and any and all response costs, including
oversight, incurred pursuant to Administrative Order on Consent, In the Matter of: Martin Marietta Corporation,
Docket Nos. CERCLA 106 VIII&hyph;86&hyph;2 and RCRA (3008) VIII&hyph;86&hyph;01. The $875,592.92 figure represents
approximately 91 percent of the total amount of Past Response Costs incurred by the United States.

 Section 73.1510 requires that a licensee of an AM, FM and TV broadcast station file an informal application with the
FCC to request an experimental authorization to conduct technical experimentation directed toward improvement
of the technical phases of operation and service. This request shall describe the nature and purpose of experimentation
to be conducted, the nature of the experimental signal to be transmitted, and the proposed schedule of hours and duration
of the experimentation. The data is used by FCC staff to maintain complete technical information about a broadcast
station and to ensure that such experimentation will not cause interference to other stations.

 Section 73.1615 requires notification to the FCC by a licensee of an AM, FM or TV station when it is in the process of modifying
existing facilities as authorized by a construction permit and it becomes necessary to either discontinue operation
or to operate with temporary facilities. If such licensee needs to discontinue operations or operate with temporary
facilities for more than 30 days, then an informal letter request must be sent to the FCC prior to the 30th day. The data
is used by FCC staff to maintain complete technical records and to ensure that interference will not be caused to other
licensed broadcast facilities.

for permanent exemption of its Local Freight Tariff No. 3&hyph;C, FMC&hyph;F No. 4, ICC TOTE 201, from the electronic

that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.

The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, Osaka, Japan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and section 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23), for approval
to engage through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sumitomo Bank Securities, Inc., New York, New York (Company), in underwriting
and dealing in, to a limited extent, certain municipal revenue bonds, 1-4 family mortgage-related securities, consumer
receivable-related securities, and commercial paper. Applicant proposes to conduct the activities on a world-wide
basis.

Closely Related to Banking Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``that the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto''. In determining whether a
proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the matters set forth in National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 516 F.2d
1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services
as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require
their provision in a specialized form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable
or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks.

Proper Incident to Banking Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and result in greater convenience
to Applicant's customers. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse
effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or
unsound banking practices, and that Company will conduct the proposed activities in accordance with prudential
limitations designed to safeguard against such potential adverse effects that have been relied upon by the Board
in similar previous cases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., Citicorp, supra; The Sanwa Bank, Limited, supra.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this regard, Applicant has requested that one of the prudential limitations be modified to permit one officer or
one director of one of its United States banking affiliates to serve as a director of Company, a modification which
Applicant maintains is consistent with prior Board actions.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission announces the revised thresholds for interlocking directorates required by the 1990
amendment of section 8 of the Clayton Act. Section 8 prohibits, with certain exceptions, one person from serving as
a director or officer of two competing corporations if two thresholds are met. Competitor corporations are covered
by section 8 if each one has capital, surplus, and undivided profits aggregating more than $10,000,000, with the exception
that no corporation is covered if the competitive sales of either corporation are less than $1,000,000. Section 8(a)(5)
requires the Federal Trade Commission to revise those thresholds annually, based on the change in gross national
product. The new thresholds, which take effect immediately, are $12,092,000 for section 8(a)(1), and $1,209,200
for section 8(a)(2)(A).

 The Deputy Commissioner for Operations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is denying a request for a hearing
and issuing a final order under section 306(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 335a(a))
permanently debarring Mr. David J. Brancato, 13010 Atlantic Ave., Rockville, MD 20851, from providing services
in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding
that Mr. Brancato was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval,
including the process for development or approval of a drug product; and relating to the regulation of a drug product
under the act.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
David J. Brancato, a former review chemist with FDA's Division of Generic Drugs, pled guilty and was sentenced on January
5, 1990, for receiving unlawful gratuities, a felony offense under 18 U.S.C. 201(c)(1)(B). This conviction was based
on Mr. Brancato's acceptance of payment of approximately $4,300 from senior officials of generic drug manufacturers,
Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Par), and its subsidiary, Quad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Quad), while Mr. Brancato was involved
in the regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products and while he was specifically responsible for reviewing Par's
and Quad's applications to determine whether those applications met certain statutory standards for approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 12, 1992, Mr. Brancato received a certified letter from the Deputy Commissioner for Operations offering
Mr. Brancato an opportunity for a hearing on the agency's proposal to issue an order under section 306(a) of the act
debarring him from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application.
FDA based the proposal to debar Mr. Brancato on its finding that he was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct
relating to the development, approval, and regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certified letter further informed Mr. Brancato that his request for a hearing could not rest upon mere allegations
or denials but must present specific facts showing that there was a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring
a hearing. The letter also notified Mr. Brancato that if it conclusively appeared from the face of the information
and factual analyses in his request for a hearing that there was no genuine and substantial issue of fact which precluded
the order of debarment, FDA would enter summary judgment against him and deny his request for a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated December 21, 1992, Mr. Brancato requested a hearing and submitted arguments and information in support
of his hearing request. In his request for a hearing, Mr. Brancato acknowledges that he was convicted of a felony under
Federal law as alleged by FDA; however, he argues that FDA's findings are incorrect and that the agency's proposal
to debar him is unconstitutional.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Deputy Commissioner for Operations has considered Mr. Brancato's arguments and concludes that they are unpersuasive
and fail to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing. The legal arguments that Mr. Brancato
offers do not create a basis for a hearing because hearings are not granted on matters of policy or law, but only on genuine
and substantial issues of fact (see 21 CFR 12.24(b)(1)). Additionally, the material submitted in support of Mr. Brancato's
hearing request does not justify a hearing because hearings will not be granted on the basis of mere allegations, denials,
or general descriptions of positions and contentions (see 21 CFR 12.24(b)(2)). Moreover, all of Mr. Brancato's arguments
are unconvincing for the reasons discussed below.

II. Conclusions of the Deputy Commissioner Concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Brancato's Arguments in Support of a Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Mandatory Debarment of Individuals Applies Retroactively to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Convictions Occurring Within the Past 5 Years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Brancato first alleges that the debarment provisions do not apply to conduct which occurred prior to the effective
date of the act. Mr. Brancato does not support this claim with further argument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of the act applicable to Mr. Brancato is section 306(a)(2) of the act. Initiation of debarment proceedings
under that section is not limited by when the conduct underlying the conviction occurred, but rather, by when the conviction
occurred. Under section 306(a)(2) of the act, debarment proceedings must be initiated within 5 years of the conviction
(see section 306(l)(2) of the act). Debarment of Mr. Brancato is appropriately based upon his January 5, 1990, conviction,
occurring less than 4 years ago. Because the 5-year statute of limitations has not expired, Mr. Brancato's argument
fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unclear from Mr. Brancato's first argument whether he intended to further allege that the debarment provisions
do not apply retroactively to convictions occurring prior to the effective date of the act. Nevertheless, this issue
is addressed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress intended section 306(a)(2) of the act to be retroactive as evidenced by comparing section 306(a)(2) of the
act, applicable to mandatory debarment of individuals, to section 306(a)(1) of the act, applicable to mandatory
debarment of corporations. The act treats corporations differently from individuals with respect to retroactivity.
Mandatory debarment of corporations under section 306(a)(1) of the act is not retroactive because debarment of corporations
is explicitly limited to convictions occurring ``after the date of enactment.'' Conversely, section 306(a)(2)
of the act, pertaining to mandatory debarment of individuals, does not contain any such limiting language. The exclusion
of language barring retroactivity for section 306(a)(2) implies that section 306(a)(2) of the act was intended by
Congress to be implemented retroactively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 306(l)(2) of the act shows that section 306(a)(2), pertaining to mandatory debarment of individuals,
was intended to be retroactive. Section 306(l)(2) of the act sets out the effective dates for each provision of the
act. As noted above, the effective dates pertaining to section 306(a)(2) of the act state that any relevant conviction
may be used as the basis for mandatory debarment of individuals, so long as the conviction occurred no more than 5 years
prior to the initiation of debarment proceedings. Section 306(l) of the act states that certain other debarment provisions
shall not be retroactive by limiting application of those provisions to actions occurring on or after June 1, 1992.
Thus, where Congress intended a section not to be retroactive, it provided an effective date in section 306(l) of the
act. The omission of an effective date for section 306(a) of the act and the inclusion of an effective date for other
sections reveals Congress' intent that this section be retroactive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, as intended by Congress, and as supported by the explicit language of the act, mandatory debarment applies retrospectively
and, thus, mandatory debarment applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Brancato's conviction, which occurred within 5 years prior to the effective date of the act. Accordingly, Mr.
Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Decision To Debar Mr. Brancato Was Based Upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relevant Considerations and Was Made by an Authorized Designee of the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Brancato next argues that notice to him of his proposed debarment does not reflect consideration by the Secretary
of Health and Human Services or his designee. Mr. Brancato does not support this claim with facts or further argument.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 201 through 903 of the act (21 U.S.C. 321 through 394) contain numerous grants of authority to the Secretary
of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). The Secretary has, in general, delegated this authority
to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs with authority to redelegate to the Deputy Commissioner for Operations and other
officers of FDA (see 21 CFR 5.10 and 5.20). The authority conferred in section 306 of the act is delegated to the Commissioner,
even though the legislation formally names the Secretary. The Commissioner has redelegated that authority to the
Deputy Commissioner for Operations (21 CFR 5.20(b) and 5.20(g)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of proposed debarment and opportunity for a hearing letter received by Mr. Brancato on December 12, 1992,
was issued legally under authority delegated to FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to propose debarment of Mr. Brancato was appropriately based upon the following relevant considerations:
(1) The nature of the conviction (a felony under Federal law) and (2) the conduct underlying the conviction (conduct
relating to the development, approval, and regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products) (see section I. of this document).
Because the Deputy Commissioner for Operations, an authorized designee of the Secretary, considered the relevant
factors in making the determination to propose debarment, Mr. Brancato's claim that the notice of his proposed debarment
does not reflect consideration by the Secretary or his designee fails to raise any issue as to the validity of this proceeding
and fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Mr. Brancato's Conviction Subjects Him to the Mandatory Debarment Provisions Not to the Permissive Debarment
Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Brancato further contends that the conduct for which he was convicted is more appropriately conduct subject to
permissive debarment under 21 U.S.C. 306(b)(2)(B) of the act rather than to mandatory debarment. Mr. Brancato fails
to support this statement with an explanation or further argument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 306(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B) of the act mandates that FDA debar an individual if the Secretary finds that the
individual has been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct: (1) Relating to the development or approval,
including the process for development or approval, of any drug product; and (2) otherwise relating to the regulation
of any drug product under the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, Mr. Brancato's conviction for receiving unlawful gratuities triggers the section 306 (a)(2)
(A) and (a)(2)(B) of the act mandatory debarment provisions. An individual convicted of this crime will not be considered
a candidate for permissive debarment unless FDA finds that the conduct underlying the conviction did not relate to
the development or approval, or the regulation of any drug product (see section 306(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the act). Absent
such a finding, mandatory debarment based upon such a conviction must follow. Because FDA finds that the conduct which
served the basis for Mr. Brancato's conviction did relate to the development and approval and the regulation of Par's
and Quad's drug products, the mandatory provisions, rather than the permissive provisions, are applicable in this
case. Mr. Brancato acknowledges that he was convicted of a felony under Federal law. Furthermore, he does not dispute
FDA's finding that the conduct underlying his conviction relates to the development and approval and the regulation
of Par's and Quad's drug products. Therefore, Mr. Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue
of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. The Statutory Criteria Pertaining to Permissive Debarment Are Not Relevant to Mr. Brancato's Mandatory Debarment
Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Brancato states the following: (1) There is no evidence that the Secretary considered the statutory criteria
for determining appropriateness and period of debarment for nonmandatory (permissive) debarment, (2) Mr. Brancato
took voluntary steps to mitigate the impact of his offense on the public, and (3) Mr. Brancato has no prior convictions.
Mr. Brancato fails to support these three statements with further argument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed, the mandatory debarment provisions, not the permissive debarment provisions, apply in this case.
The criteria pertaining to permissive debarment, which include evidence of mitigation and prior convictions, may
not be considered in making the decision to initiate mandatory debarment proceedings. Because Mr. Brancato argues
for the consideration of irrelevant permissive debarment criteria, not applicable to Mr. Brancato's mandatory
debarment action, his claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Mr. Brancato's Plea Agreement With the Government Does Not Preclude His Debarment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In his next argument, Mr. Brancato states that his guilty plea and cooperation with the government were predicated
on the assumption that no civil penalties would flow from his cooperation and that debarment would render his guilty
plea subject to collateral attack and jeopardizes the integrity of the judicial process. He does not support this
claim with evidence or citations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Brancato's claim is completely unsubstantiated. The April 13, 1989, plea agreement represents the complete
and final embodiment of Mr. Brancato's and the government's intention; the agreement explicitly states that ``[t]here
are no other agreements, promises, undertakings or understandings between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Brancato and this Office.'' Contrary to Mr. Brancato's ``assumption,'' the terms of the plea agreement do not
preclude subsequent civil or administrative actions, including debarment. The terms bar only subsequent criminal
action. Because the plea agreement is the complete and final expression of the compromise between Mr. Brancato and
the government, and because the agreement does not preclude debarment, Mr. Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine
and substantial issue of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Debarment of Mr. Brancato Is Not Prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In his final argument, Mr. Brancato states, ``individuals who cooperate with the government should not be subject
to sanctions of this kind 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex post facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' Mr. Brancato fails to support this statement with an explanation or case citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is unclear from this statement what point Mr. Brancato is attempting to make, two separate arguments may
be implied: That his cooperation exempts him from the debarment provisions, and that his debarment violates the ex
post facto clause of the United States Constitution. Both arguments are discussed individually below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the mandatory debarment provisions, not the permissive debarment provisions, apply in this
case. Cooperation with the government may not be considered in the decision to initiate mandatory debarment proceedings.
(Cooperation may, however, be considered in determining whether to grant special early termination of debarment,
under section 306(d)(4)(C) of the act, to individuals and as evidence of mitigation, in determining appropriateness
and period of permissive debarment.) Because Mr. Brancato's cooperation is immaterial here, his claim fails to raise
a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Brancato further suggests that the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits application of section
306(a)(2) of the act to him because this section was not in effect at the time of Mr. Brancato's criminal conduct. Section
306(a)(2) of the act was enacted on May 13, 1992. The conduct underlying Mr. Brancato's conviction occurred in 1987,
and his conviction occurred in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ex post facto law is one which punishes acts occurring prior to enactment of the law, or which adds a new punishment
to one that was in effect when the crime was committed. (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 110 S.Ct. 2715 (1990).) Retroactive application of a law to serve a remedial purpose does not violate the ex post facto
clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because debarment is intended as a remedy, rather than a punishment, retroactive application of the mandatory debarment
provisions of the act is not prohibited by the ex post facto clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Debarment was clearly intended to be remedial. Congress created the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 (GDEA) in
response to findings of fraud and corruption in the generic drug industry. Both the language of the GDEA itself and
its legislative history reveal that the purpose of the debarment provisions is remedial: ``to restore and ensure
the integrity of the ANDA approval process and to protect the public health'' (see section 1, Pub. L. 102&hyph;282,
(GDEA)). A statement by Senator Hatch supports the remedial character of debarment as follows: ``*&blank;*&blank;*
[t]he legislation *&blank;*&blank;* provides a much-needed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
remedy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the blatant fraud and corruption uncovered in the generic drug industry *&blank;*&blank;* during the last 3 years.''
(Emphasis added.) (See Congressional Record, April 10, 1992, at S 5616.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established by the Supreme Court that statutes which deny future privileges to convicted offenders because
of their previous criminal activities in order to ensure against corruption in specified areas do not impose penalties
for past conduct and, therefore, do not violate the ex post facto prohibitions (see, e.g.,

The question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct,
is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual
comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation, such as the proper qualifications for a profession

As in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DeVeau,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the legislative purpose of the relevant statute is to ensure that fraud and corruption are eliminated from the generic
drug industry. The restrictions placed on individuals convicted of a felony under Federal law are not intended as
punishment but are ``incident to a regulation of a present situation'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DeVeau,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 363 U.S. at 160) and are necessary in order to remedy the past fraud and corruption in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history is replete with statements that the GDEA provides the reasonable means needed to eliminate
the widespread corruption in the generic drug industry and to restore consumer confidence in generic drugs. Because
debarment is a remedial action, rather than one intended to punish, debarment does not violate the ex post facto clause
and Mr. Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, Mr. Brancato has raised no genuine and substantial issue of fact regarding his conviction. He acknowledges
his conviction as alleged by FDA in the agency proposal to debar him. In addition, Mr. Brancato's legal arguments do
not create a basis for a hearing and, in any event, are unpersuasive. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations
denies Mr. Brancato's request for a hearing.

III. Findings and Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations, under section 306(a) of the act, and under authority delegated
to her (21 CFR 5.20), finds that Mr. Brancato has been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct: (1) Relating
to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of a drug product (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(A));
and (2) relating to the regulation of a drug product (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(B)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the foregoing findings, Mr. Brancato is permanently debarred from providing services in any capacity
to a person with an approved or pending drug product application under sections 505, 507, 512, or 802 of the act (21 U.S.C.
355, 357, 360b, or 382), or under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), effective on January
6, 1994 (21 U.S.C. 335a(c)(1)(B) and (c)(2)(A)(ii) and 21 U.S.C. 321(ee)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person with an approved or pending drug product application who knowingly uses the services of Mr. Brancato in
any capacity, during his period of debarment, will be subject to civil money penalties (21 U.S.C. 335b(a)(6)). If
Mr. Brancato, during his period of debarment, provides services in any capacity to a person with an approved or pending
drug product application, he will be subject to civil money penalties (21 U.S.C. 335b(a)(7)). In addition, FDA will
not accept or review any abbreviated new drug application or abbreviated antibiotic drug application submitted
by or with Mr. Brancato's assistance during his period of debarment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Brancato may file an application to attempt to terminate his debarment, pursuant to section 306(d)(4)(A) of the
act. Any such application would be reviewed under the criteria and processes set forth in section 306(d)(4)(C) and
(d)(4)(D) of the act. Such an application should be identified with Docket No. 92N&hyph;0416 and sent to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). All such submissions are to be filed in four copies. The public availability of
information in these submissions is governed by 21 CFR 10.20(j). Publicly available submissions may be seen in the
Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a proposed guideline entitled ``Microbiological
Testing of Antimicrobial Drug Residues in Food'' prepared by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regarding
the tests required for food-animal antimicrobial drug products to establish their human-food safety. This proposed
guideline provides criteria for determining which antimicrobials will require supplemental testing, and recommends
test procedures that are necessary to ensure that antimicrobial residues will not cause intestinal microflora perturbations
in the consumer.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is announcing the availability of a proposed guideline entitled ``Microbiological Testing of Antimicrobial
Drug Residues in Food'' regarding required testing for food-animal antimicrobial drug products. In evaluating
new animal drug applications (NADA's) the agency must determine, among other factors, the safety of the intended
use of the drug, including the cumulative effect on man or animal required by section 512(d)(2)(B) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(2)(B)). The proposed guideline provides criteria that will be
used to determine which antimicrobial drugs will require supplemental testing to ensure that antimicrobial residues
will not cause intestinal microflora perturbations in the consumer exposed to antimicrobial residues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is well known that therapeutic doses of antibiotics can cause adverse effects on the intestinal microflora ecology.
In most cases the lowest dose at which these perturbations occur have not been determined; however, CVM believes that
the ecology of the human intestinal microflora should not be disturbed by the residues of antimicrobials used in food-animals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In June 1992, CVM sponsored a symposium on the Microbiological Significance of Drug Residues in Food to evaluate scientific
expertise in this area. Information discussed at the symposium reaffirmed CVM's conclusion that the residue antimicrobial
activity is a valid endpoint for establishing residue tolerances for antimicrobial animal drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 CVM proposes establishing two categories for antimicrobial drugs: (1) ``New Animal Antimicrobial Drugs Requiring
Additional Human Food Safety Microbiological Testing'' and (2) ``New Animal Antimicrobial Drugs Exempt from Additional
Human Food Safety Microbiological Testing.'' To qualify for exemption from additional microbiological testing,
the antimicrobial drug must have either: (1) ``Very low'' residue levels, (2) residues with limited antimicrobial
activity, or (3) no adverse effects on intestinal microflora at approved dosages. Antimicrobial drugs will require
additional testing in cases where a safe residue concentration retains antimicrobial activity in humans at residue
exposure levels greater than 1 part per million in the total diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 CVM requests comments regarding how the proposed guideline should relate the effects of low doses of antibiotics
observed in model systems to potential adverse biological effects in humans. In addition, information is requested
on the appropriate endpoints for monitoring the effects of the different classes of antibiotics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Interested persons may, on or before April 6, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments on the proposed guideline. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The
proposed guideline and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice would establish special payment limits for standard home blood glucose monitors, identified as code
E0607 of the HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). This proposed notice is intended to prevent excessive payment
for these items. Currently, payment under the Medicare program for home blood glucose monitors and other items of
durable medical equipment (DME) is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for the item or the fee schedule
amount for the item. This notice proposes that payment for standard home blood glucose monitors be equal to 80 percent
of the lesser of the actual charge or a special payment limit.

A. Special Reasonable Charge Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Payment for DME furnished under Part B of the Medicare program (Supplementary Medical Insurance) is made through
contractors known as carriers. Before January 1, 1989, payment for DME was made on a reasonable charge basis. The methodology
used by the carriers to establish reasonable charges is set forth in sections 1833 and 1842(b) of the Social Security
Act (the Act) and in 42 CFR part 405, subpart E. Reasonable charge determinations are generally based on customary
and prevailing charges derived from historic charge data. The reasonable charge for an item of DME was generally set
at the lowest of the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The supplier's actual charge for the item. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The supplier's customary charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The prevailing charge in the locality for the item. (The prevailing charge may not exceed the 75th percentile
of the customary charges of suppliers in the locality.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The inflation indexed charge (IIC). The IIC is defined in &sect;405.509(a) as the lowest of the fee screens
used to determine reasonable charges for services, supplies, and equipment paid on a reasonable charge basis (excluding
physicians' services) that is in effect on December 31 of the previous fee screen year, updated by the inflation adjustment
factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1842(b)(3) of the Act requires that all payments under Part B of the Medicare program must be reasonable. Paragraphs
(8) and (9) of section 1842(b) of the Act provide that we may establish a special reasonable charge limit for a category
of service if, after consultation with representatives of affected parties, we determine that the standard rules
for calculating reasonable charges result in grossly deficient or excessive charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicable regulations are located at &sect;405.502(g). Section 405.502(g) requires that we consider the available
information that is relevant to the category of service and establish reasonable charge limits that are realistic
and equitable. The limit on the reasonable charge is an upper limit to correct a grossly excessive charge or a lower
limit to correct a grossly deficient charge. The limit is either a specific dollar amount or is based on a special method
to be used in determining the reasonable charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 405.502(g)(1) provides the following examples of circumstances that may result in grossly deficient or
excessive charges: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The marketplace is not competitive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Medicare and Medicaid are the sole or primary source of payment for a service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The charges involve the use of new technology for which an extensive charge history does not exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The charges do not reflect changing technology, increased facility with that technology, or changes in acquisition,
production, or supplier costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The prevailing charges for a service in a particular locality are substantially higher or lower than prevailing
charges in other comparable localities, taking into account the relative costs of furnishing the services in the
different localities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Charges are grossly lower than or exceed acquisition or production costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There have been increases in charges for a service that cannot be explained by inflation or technology.

also provides that the proposed and final notices must set forth the criteria and circumstances, if any, under which
a carrier may grant an exception to the limit(s).

B. DME Fee Schedules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4062 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87) (Public Law 100&hyph;203), which added section
1834(a) to the Act, provides for a fee schedule payment methodology for DME furnished on or after January 1, 1989. (This
fee schedule payment methodology is set forth in 42 CFR part 414, subpart D.) Sections 1834(a)(1) (A) and (B) of the
Act provide that Medicare payment for DME is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for the item or the
fee schedule amount for the item. Section 1834(a) of the Act classifies DME into the following payment categories:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Inexpensive or other routinely purchased DME. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Customized items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Oxygen and oxygen equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other items of DME (capped rental items).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a separate methodology for determining the fee schedule payment amount for each category of DME. The fee schedules
are adjusted annually by a covered item update factor. The covered item update factor is generally equal to the change
in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI&hyph;U) for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the preceding
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1834(a)(10)(B) provides that we may apply the special payment limits authority of paragraphs (8) and (9)
of section 1842(b) to covered items of DME and suppliers of these items and payments under section 1834(a) in the same
manner as these provisions apply to physician's services and physicians and reasonable charges under section 1842(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Payment for Home Blood Glucose Monitors (Code E0607) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard home blood glucose monitors allow individuals to measure their blood glucose and, then, alter their diets
or insulin dosages to ensure that they are maintaining an adequate blood glucose level. Home blood glucose monitors
are covered by the Medicare program as DME and are classified under the inexpensive and other routinely purchased
DME payment category defined in section 1834(a)(2) of the Act. Section 1834(a)(2) specifies that inexpensive and
other routinely purchased DME are those items of DME that have a purchase price that does not exceed $150 or are acquired
at least 75 percent of the time by purchase. We determined that home blood glucose monitors belong in this category
based on a review of data that show that these monitors are acquired at least 75 percent of the time by purchase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1834(a)(2) requires that payment for items falling within this category be made on a purchase or rental basis
and that local purchase and rental fee schedule amounts be calculated for each item. Section 414.220(c)(1) provides
for the calculation of purchase fee schedules for both new and used DME within this category. The fee schedule amounts
for purchased new, purchased used, and rental DME within this category are based on the average reasonable charges
for purchased new, purchased used, and rental DME, respectively, from the base year period of July 1, 1986 through
June 30, 1987.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current 1993 fee schedule amounts for code E0607 accurately reflect the average reasonable charges for home blood
glucose monitors in 1986, adjusted by 1.7 percent (the percentage increase in the CPI&hyph;U for the 6-month period
ending with December 1987) and by the cumulative covered item update factor. The average 1993 fee schedule amount
for purchased new home blood glucose monitors, excluding the fee schedule amounts for the Virgin Islands, Alaska,
Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, is $178.73. However, as we explain below, due to manufacturers' widespread practice of issuing
consumer rebates, the fee schedule amounts substantially exceed the effective purchase amount (the list purchase
amount less any rebate) paid by the general public in all localities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have reviewed pricing and rebate information available for the years 1986 through 1993 to become familiar with
the home blood glucose monitor market. Our pricing and rebate sources include: mail order catalogs (such as Bruce
Medical Supply catalog, St. Louis Medical Supply, and Institutional Products), advertisements listed in newspapers
and periodicals (such as Drug Topics and Shopper's Guide), and pharmacy and other retail store fliers. For the purposes
of this analysis, we focused on home blood glucose monitor pricing and national rebate programs listed in the Winter
1993 edition of the Bruce Medical Supply catalog (Vol. 15, No. 1), but the pricing and rebate information found in the
Bruce catalog is consistent with the pricing and rebate information available in all the other sources we examined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in our experience, the Bruce catalog listed the largest number of home blood glucose monitors made by
the largest number of home blood glucose monitor manufacturers, and reflected the national rebate programs offered
by these manufacturers. Six different brands of home blood glucose monitors, manufactured by five different organizations,
can be purchased from the Bruce catalog from any location in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin
Islands and are covered under Medicare. The monitors listed are: Accu-Chek III, manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim;
Checkmate, manufactured by Cascade Medical; ExacTech Companion and ExacTech Pen, manufactured by MediSence; Glucometer
3, manufactured by Miles, Inc.; One Touch II, manufactured by Lifescan; and Tracer II, manufactured by Boehringer
Mannheim. We estimate that the six monitors listed in the Bruce catalog account for approximately 90 percent of the
market. This estimate is based on marketing information presented in an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal
on November 12, 1992 (Marketing and Media section, B1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are using the Bruce catalog pricing and rebate information because it is a convenient single reference. We believe
the catalog is indicative of market pricing for home blood glucose monitors. In addition, the catalog lists the national
rebate programs offered by the manufacturers of the monitors. By choosing the Bruce catalog as the source of data for
proposing payment limits, we are not recommending that future purchases of home blood glucose monitors by Medicare
beneficiaries be made through the Bruce catalog. We are confident that comparable net prices are available in all
localities from the various other mail order or retail outlets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the fee schedule base year period (July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987), retail prices for home blood glucose
monitors generally exceeded $150. Since then, several lower priced models have appeared on the market while the older,
higher priced models have been phased out. The growth in the home blood glucose monitor market and advances in the technology
of producing these monitors have caused the market value of the home blood glucose monitor to decline steadily, so
that now this item is readily available at prices below $70. In addition, manufacturers have begun the widespread
practice of issuing consumer rebates to promote their products. Mail-in manufacturers' rebates ranging from $20
to $75 have been available over the past several years. The Medicare program does not receive the benefit of many of
these rebates because, although suppliers bill for the price of the equipment, the rebates are sent to the beneficiary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average list price of the six monitors in the Bruce catalog is $65.44. Manufacturer rebates, ranging from $30 to
$50, are available for four of these monitors. A fifth monitor, the Checkmate, is listed at a price of $61.90, but can
be obtained through the catalog free of charge with the purchase of two boxes of Checkmate test strips, supplies that
are essential for the effective use of the Checkmate monitoring system. New home blood glucose monitors are now available
to the general public at a net cost that is well below the fee schedule amounts established for code E0607. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our findings are supported by the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) report ``Durable Medical Equipment_Review
of Medicare Payments for Home Blood Glucose Monitors'' (A&hyph;09&hyph;92&hyph;00034)_issued in December of
1992. In this report, the OIG states that excessive Medicare payments have been made for home blood glucose monitors
because claims were not adjusted to reflect manufacturers' rebates. The OIG reviewed a sample of 80 Medicare claims
for monitors processed by 2 carriers. From this sample, the OIG identified 50 claims for which rebates were available
at the time the monitors were purchased. The OIG found that Medicare payment for only 5 of these 50 claims were reduced
by the amount of the rebate. The OIG concluded that the fee schedule amounts established for code E0607 based on pre-1987
historic charges are excessive.

D. Supplier Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1834(a)(10)(B) and 1842(b)(9)(A)(i) of the Act require that we consult with representatives of the suppliers
likely to be affected by any change in payment before making a determination that a fee schedule amount(s) is not inherently
reasonable by reason of its grossly excessive or deficient amount. On June 15, 1993, we met with representatives of
suppliers of home blood glucose monitors (hereinafter referred to as supplier representatives) to discuss issues
relating to Medicare payment for these devices. The following is a synopsis of the comments and concerns of the supplier
representatives as expressed at this meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supplier representatives were primarily concerned about the use of manufacturer rebate information in determining
appropriate Medicare payment amounts for home blood glucose monitors. They maintained that the rebate programs
are purely a marketing tool used by the manufacturers to promote the sale of their monitors, that the rebates do not
relate in any way to the ``market price'' of the monitors, and that the rebate programs are not permanent and, therefore,
should not be used as a basis for establishing payment amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, if a manufacturer's rebate is included in the charge listed on a claim submitted for reimbursement to Medicare,
that rebate is to be clearly and specifically identified and is to be annotated as not reimbursable under Medicare.
Payment is based on the lower of the actual charge for the equipment (the submitted charge less the rebate amount) or
the fee schedule amount. However, as noted in the OIG report discussed above, in a majority of cases, the rebates are
not reported on the claims submitted to Medicare, resulting in Medicare overpayments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Medicare payment amounts for home blood glucose monitors should not exceed the amounts paid by the general public
for these devices. The price of a home blood glucose monitor less any available rebate amount represents the actual
cost to the consumer for the device and is an appropriate basis for establishing Medicare payment amounts for these
devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of home blood glucose monitors, manufacturer rebates are widespread and have been available for several
years. The OIG reported that manufacturer rebates for home blood glucose monitors generally range from about $30
to $75 and that the duration of the rebate offer is continually extended, often lasting for more than 1 year or until
a new model is introduced. Given the facts underlying the pricing of these monitors, the retail prices of home blood
glucose monitors less the available rebate amounts are reasonable measures of the market value of these devices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supplier representatives maintained that some rebate programs are not available in some areas of the United States.
However, the rebates listed in the Bruce Medical Supply catalog are available to all Medicare beneficiaries living
in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supplier representatives stated that we should consider establishing inherent reasonableness limits for blood
glucose test strips, identified as code A4253 of the HCPCS. Medicare payment for these supplies is made on a reasonable
charge basis. The Medicare carriers, therefore, have the authority to establish inherent reasonableness limits
for code A4253. We are aware of several carriers that have established inherent reasonableness limits for this code.

II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on our own experience and the work of OIG, and after consulting with representatives of suppliers of home blood
glucose monitors, we have determined that the fee schedule amounts for code E0607 are grossly excessive and are not
inherently reasonable. In accordance with section 1842(b)(8) of the Act, we are proposing to replace the use of a fee
schedule payment with special payment limits for code E0607. These special payment limits would not apply to home
blood glucose monitors with special features (HCPCS code E0609).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
These proposed limits are based on pricing and manufacturers' rebates contained in the Winter 1993 edition of the
Bruce Medical Supply catalog. We based the proposed limits for the continental U.S. on the median net cost, rounded
to the nearest dollar, of five of the six monitors listed in the catalog. We omitted the Checkmate monitor because this
monitor is relatively new to the market and has little market history. We determined the cost for each monitor to be
equal to the Bruce Medical Supply list price decreased by the manufacturer's mail-in rebate (if applicable) and increased
by appropriate shipping and handling charges effective December 1992. After making the adjustments for rebates
and shipping and handling charges, we are proposing a limit of $57 which exceeds the final cost for four of the six monitors
listed in the catalog. We permitted an additional shipping charge of $8 for monitors that are purchased in Alaska,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, our review of current pricing and rebate information
shows that several brands of new home blood glucose monitors can be widely purchased at prices below the proposed limits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The final median cost of the monitors listed in the Bruce catalog, excluding the Checkmate monitor, including shipping
and handling, and rounded to the nearest dollar is $57. We propose that this amount be established as the special payment
limit for new home blood glucose monitors furnished within the continental United States. The final median cost for
these monitors, if furnished in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands, including shipping
and handling, and rounded to the nearest dollar is $65. We propose that this amount be established as the special payment
limit for new home blood glucose monitors furnished outside the continental United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that shipping and handling costs are unique to mail-order outlets and are not generally experienced
by retail outlets; however, we have chosen to include these shipping and handling costs, without regard to the type
of supplier, as a proxy for similar costs such as transportation and overhead that might be incurred by retail stores.
The average shipping and handling cost per monitor in the continental U.S. is approximately $7, an amount that we believe
sufficiently reflects expenses incurred by retail stores that supply home blood glucose monitors. The additional
shipping allowance of $8 is intended to reflect additional costs of shipping outside the continental U.S.

2. Purchased Used Home Blood Glucose Monitors

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Historically, Medicare allowed payment amounts for the purchase of used DME have been set at approximately 75 percent
of the corresponding allowed payment amounts for the purchase of new DME. Based on this ongoing policy, for purchased
used home blood glucose monitors, the special payment limits would be equal to 75 percent of the special payment limits
for purchased new monitors. If the special payment limit for a purchased new home blood glucose monitor is $57, the
special payment limit for the purchased used monitor would be $42.75.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Historically, Medicare-allowed payment amounts for the rental of DME have been set at approximately 10 percent of
the corresponding allowed payment amounts for the purchase of new DME. Based on this ongoing policy, for rented home
blood glucose monitors, the special payment limits would be equal to 10 percent of the special payment limits for purchased
new monitors. If the special payment limit for a purchased new home blood glucose monitor is $57, the special payment
limit for a rented monitor would be $5.70 each month. The total payment for a rented monitor would not be allowed to exceed
the lower of the actual charge or the fee for the purchase of the monitor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
B. Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The initial special payment limits we propose would apply to standard home blood glucose monitors furnished on or
after the effective date of the published final notice and before January 1, 1994. For standard home blood glucose
monitors furnished in calendar year 1994, the special payment limits would be equal to the initial special payment
limits increased by the 1994 covered item update factor (the factor used to update other items of DME). The covered
item update for 1994, and each subsequent year, is defined in section 1834(a)(14)(B) of the Act as the percentage increase
in the CPI&hyph;U for the 12-month period ending with June of the previous year. For each calendar year after 1994,
the special payment limits would be equal to the special payment limits for the preceding calendar year increased
by the covered item update for the calendar year to which the limits would apply.

C. Payment for Home Blood Glucose Monitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
We propose that payment for home blood glucose monitors be equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for
the monitor or the appropriate special payment limit, as described in section A above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any notice
that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government
agencies, or geographic regions; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the
ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed notice would reduce unnecessary Medicare program expenditures for standard home blood glucose monitors.
Currently, payment under the Medicare program for home glucose monitors is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the
actual charge for the item or the fee schedule amount for the item. Under this proposed notice, payment would be equal
to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge or the appropriate special payment limit proposed by this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing special payment limits for purchased new home blood glucose monitors for Medicare beneficiaries
of $57 if the monitor is furnished within the continental United States and $65 if furnished in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico, or the Virgin Islands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We estimate that imposing special payment limits for purchased new home blood glucose monitors would produce savings
of $5 million annually, or $25 million from FY 1994 through FY 1998. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice would not meet the $100 million criterion nor would it meet the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, this
notice is not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and an initial regulatory impact analysis is not required.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all suppliers and manufacturers of home blood glucose
monitors are considered to be small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In determining whether to adjust payment rates for standard home blood glucose monitors, we considered the potential
impacts on quality, access, and beneficiary liability of the adjustment, including the likely effects on assignment
rates and participation rates of suppliers (as required by section 1842(b)(8)(C) of the Act). These considerations
are addressed below in this impact analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice would affect suppliers of standard home blood glucose monitors. Their Medicare payments could be reduced
by the amount of the estimated savings. Suppliers can choose to accept assignment, which means they agree to accept
Medicare's approved amount as payment in full. It is possible that, as a consequence of our reducing payments for code
E0607, the number of suppliers accepting assignment of a beneficiary's claim for Medicare payment for this code may
decrease if suppliers choose instead to charge beneficiaries the full difference between the amount charged and
the lower Medicare payment. Also, the number of suppliers who elect to become ``participating suppliers'' may decrease
as a result of reduced payments for code E0607. Under the Medicare participation program, a supplier that decides
to become a ``participating supplier'' must agree to accept assignment for all covered services furnished to Medicare
beneficiaries. Participating suppliers benefit by being listed in the Medicare Participating Physician/Supplier
Directories, known as Medpards, which are compiled by the Medicare carriers and furnished to various senior citizen
groups. A Medicare beneficiary can obtain the Medpard for his or her State from the Medicare carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suppliers who do not accept assignment and charge more than the Medicare approved amount can collect the balance,
that is, the actual charge minus Medicare payment, from the beneficiary. Therefore, beneficiaries who receive services
from suppliers who do not accept assignment are exposed to greater financial liability than those who receive services
from a supplier taking assignment. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to deal with participating suppliers
or purchase less expensive home blood glucose monitors in order to reduce their financial liability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of more expensive home blood glucose monitors may be affected if, as a result of this notice, suppliers
choose to provide less expensive monitors or Medicare beneficiaries decide to use less expensive monitors. We expect
that this notice would have minimal affects on the quality of monitors furnished to beneficiaries or on beneficiary
access to quality monitors. As we demonstrated above, four out of six home blood glucose monitors listed in the Bruce
Medical Supply catalog can be purchased from anywhere in the continental United States for less than $57. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though the estimated decrease in the allowed limit from $178.73 to $57 for monitors purchased in the continental U.S.
appears large, the net decrease is not large, given the size and prevalence of the rebates manufacturers have been
refunding to beneficiaries. Four of five manufacturers are giving rebates ranging from 37 percent to 70 percent of
the purchase price. In addition, the glucose test strips used with the monitors are specifically manufactured to
be used with a specific brand of monitor. The test strips frequently cost more than $.50 each and a beneficiary may use
4 or more each day. Therefore, once the beneficiary obtains a home blood glucose monitor, Medicare could pay an additional
$60 each month the beneficiary uses the medically necessary monitor. Apparently, the income generated from the ongoing
sale of the test strips far exceeds the income generated from the sale of the monitors. A manufacturer has an enormous
incentive to promote the sale of its brand of monitors in order to ensure the future sale of its brand of test strips.
For these reasons, we believe that manufacturers and suppliers will continue to provide their services to Medicare
beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a manufacturer's rebate is not reported on a Medicare claim for code E0607, and the beneficiary subsequently mails
in the rebate form, and receives the rebate, then the beneficiary receives a windfall in the amount of the rebate and
the Medicare program is not benefiting from the rebate. The beneficiary is essentially paid for purchasing a certain
brand of monitor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice would effectively eliminate any windfall that beneficiaries receive from manufacturer rebates that
are not reported on Medicare claims for code E0607. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary
certifies, that this notice would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes the Secretary to establish limits on allowable
costs incurred by a provider of services that may be paid under the Medicare program. These limits are based on estimates
of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services. Under this authority, we have maintained
limits on HHA per-visit costs since 1979. The limits may be applied to direct or indirect overall costs or to the costs
incurred for specific items or services furnished by the provider. This statutory provision is implemented in the
regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42 CFR 413.30. Additional statutory provisions governing the limits are contained at section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the
Act. Section 1861(v)(1)(L)(i) specifies that for cost reporting periods beginning after July 1, 1987, the cost limits
are not to exceed 112 percent of the mean of the labor-related and nonlabor per-visit costs for freestanding HHAs.
In addition, section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ii) of the Act has required that an adjustment be made to the cost limits for the
administrative and general (A&amp;G) costs of hospital-based agencies. The A&amp;G per-visit add-on for hospital-based
HHAs has been applied since 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We published a notice with comment period that appeared in the July 8, 1993 issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 36748) that set forth a revised schedule of limits on HHA costs for cost reporting periods beginning on or after
July 1, 1993. The limits were computed using actual cost per-visit data from cost reporting periods ending on or after
June 30, 1989 and before May 31, 1991, and were adjusted by the latest estimates in the ``market basket'' index to reflect
changes in the price of goods and services furnished by HHAs.

II. Provisions of This Final Notice With Comment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Elimination of the A&amp;G Add-on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), Public Law 103&hyph;66, was enacted.
Section 13564(b) of OBRA '93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ii) of the Act to require that, effective for cost reporting
periods beginning on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, we no longer include a payment adjustment for the administrative and general costs of hospital-based
HHAs in computing the HHA limits. Under this provision, hospital-based HHAs and freestanding HHAs will be treated
identically for payment purposes. Thus, in computing a hospital-based HHA's cost limits for cost reporting periods
beginning on or after October 1, 1993, the A&amp;G add-on amounts that were to apply, as set forth in Table II of the July
8, 1993 notice (58 FR 36753), will not be used. Other components of the July 8, 1993 notice, specifically the per-visit
limits in Table I, the wage indexes in Tables IIIa and IIIb, and the cost reporting year adjustment factors in Table
IV, will continue to be used to compute the limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that section 13564(a) of OBRA '93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act to provide that there be no
changes in the per-visit cost limits for home health services for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July
1, 1994, and before July 1, 1996. Since the effective date of that provision is different from that of the elimination
of the A&amp;G add-on, we intend to publish a separate notice in a future 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to explain the effects of the delay in the update. Again, the only change in the methodology for computing the HHA cost
limits that is effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 is the elimination of the
A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based HHAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Computing the Cost Limit for a Hospital-Based HHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The example below illustrates how an adjusted occupational therapy per-visit cost limit is calculated for a hospital-based
HHA in Dallas, Texas, with a 12-month cost reporting period beginning October 1, 1993. Because the A&amp;G add-on
has been eliminated, this example is identical to the example contained in our July 8, 1993 notice (58 FR 36752) of the
calculation of a limit for a free-standing HHA, with the exception of the application of a different cost reporting
period adjustment factor, as set forth in Table IV of that notice. These factors are based on the month and year in which
an HHA's cost reporting period begins, and are used to account for inflation in costs that occurs after the effective
date of the latest schedule of HHA limits. Thus, in the example below, the adjustment factor from Table IV of the July
8, 1993 notice for an HHA with a cost reporting period beginning October 1, 1993 is applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To arrive at the adjusted limit, the HHA's intermediary first determines the adjusted labor-related component by
multiplying the labor-related component of the limit by the appropriate wage index value, and then adjusts for budget
neutrality. The adjusted limit is the sum of the adjusted labor-related component, plus the nonlabor component,
plus other adjustments (if applicable), multiplied by the applicable cost reporting period adjustment factor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an HHA uses a cost reporting period that is not 12 months in duration, a special adjustment factor is calculated.
This is necessary because inflation projections are computed to the midpoint of the cost reporting period, and the
adjustment factors in Table IV are based on 12-month cost reporting periods. For cost reporting periods other than
12 months, the calculation must be made for the midpoint of the specific cost reporting period. In these cases, the
intermediary for the HHA obtains this adjustment factor from HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the July 8, 1993 notice, we also set forth an example of a cost-limit calculation with A&amp;G add-on for a hospital-based
HHA in State College, Pennsylvania (58 FR 36754). That example, as well as any other references in that document to
the A&amp;G add-on, are no longer applicable for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993.

III. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria
for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull; Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or adversely affect, in a material way, the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in E.O. 12866.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, for final notices such as this, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that this notice
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all
HHAs are treated as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final notice with comment period announces the provisions of section 13564(b) of OBRA '93, which provides for
the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based HHAs, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on
or after October 1, 1993. None of the provisions of this notice interprets or extends requirements beyond those set
forth in OBRA '93. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13564(b) of OBRA '93 will result in significant Federal cost savings. The impact of this provision is discussed
further below. This notice explains how the provision affects the methodology for calculating the HHA limits. We
do not believe that merely explaining the results of this provision in this notice produces any effect that will meet
any of the criteria of E.O. 12866 for a significant regulatory action or will have a significant effect on a substantial
number of small entities. Therefore, we have determined and the Secretary certifies that neither an impact statement
under E.O. 12866 nor a regulatory flexibility analysis under the RFA are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that a legislative provision being announced by a notice such as this may have a significant effect on
beneficiaries or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns.
In this instance, we believe it is desirable to inform the public of our estimate of the substantial budgetary effect
of this statutory change. We estimate that the elimination of the add-on for hospital-based HHAs will result in the
following savings to the Medicare program:

We have attempted to examine the overall effects of this provision on hospital-based HHAs. As illustrated in Table
2 below, we estimate that the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based HHAs will result in substantial
increases in the number of hospital-based HHAs that meet or exceed the cost limits.

The model used for our analysis is based on data from 1,599 hospital-based HHAs. In our July 8, 1993 notice, which used
the same model, we estimated that 774 hospital-based HHA in the model would meet or exceed the HHA cost limits. Thus,
we believe that the proportion of hospital-based HHAs that will meet or exceed the cost limits is likely to increase
from approximately 48 percent (774/1599) to 72 percent (1144/1599) as a result of the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are unable to identify the effects of this provision on individual hospital-based home health agencies. However,
we anticipate that overall FY 1994 Medicare payments for hospital-based HHAs will be approximately 6 percent less
than they would have been if the A&amp;G add-on had not been eliminated. The effects of this reduction on the total revenues
of individual hospital-based HHAs will depend on the HHA's ability to operate within the cost limits and on the proportion
of the HHA's revenues that come from the Medicare program.

Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final notice such as
this may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have not prepared a rural impact statement since we have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final
notice will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

In adopting notices such as this, we ordinarily publish a proposed notice in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with a 60-day period for public comment as required under section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. We also normally provide a
delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may waive these procedures if we find good
cause that prior notice and comment or a delay in the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to
the public interest.

Section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA '93 amended section 1861(v)(1))(L)(ii) of the Act to eliminate, effective for cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, the adjustment to the HHA cost limits to recognize the administrative
and general costs of hospital-based HHAs. In conformance with the clear direction of section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA
'93, this notice announces the elimination of the adjustment to the HHA cost limits to recognize the administrative
and general costs of hospital-based HHAs and explains the effect that this action will have on methodology for calculating
the cost limits of hospital-based HHAs. We have made no changes in this methodology beyond those directly required
by section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA '93, nor are there any other discretionary aspects to this notice. Moreover, section
13564(b)(2) of OBRA '93 mandates that these provisions are effective beginning with cost reporting periods beginning
on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993. Thus, we have concluded that in this instance, it would be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary
to the public interest to publish a proposed notice or to provide for a 30-day delay in the effective date of this notice.
Therefore, we find good cause to waive publication of a proposed notice and the 30-day delay in effective date. However,
we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated at the beginning of this notice.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final notice with comment period provides that there will be no changes in the skilled nursing facility (SNF)
cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning during Federal fiscal years 1994 and 1995 and that the add-on for
administrative and general costs of hospital-based SNFs is eliminated. This notice announces provisions of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that affect the schedule of limits on SNF routine service costs for which
payment may be made under the Medicare program and explains the effects of these provisions on the methodology used
in calculating the SNF cost limits.

Sections 1861(v)(1)(A) and 1888 of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorize the Secretary to set limits on allowable
costs incurred by a provider of services for which payment may be made under Medicare. These limits are based on estimates
of the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of needed health services. Implementing regulations appear at
42 CFR 413.30. Section 1888 of the Act directs the Secretary to set limits on per diem inpatient routine service costs
for hospital-based and freestanding skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) by urban or rural area location. Section
4008(e)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) amended section 1888(a) of the
Act to require the Secretary to update the per diem SNF cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on or after
October 1, 1992, and every 2 years thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the authority of section 1888 of the Act, we published a final notice on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46177) announcing
a schedule of limits for freestanding and hospital-based SNFs effective for cost reporting periods beginning on
or after October 1, 1992. The limits were computed using data from cost reporting periods ending on or after June 30,
1989, through May 31, 1990, for freestanding SNFs and from cost reporting periods ending on or after October 31, 1988,
through September 30, 1989, for hospital-based SNFs.

In addition to the above provisions, the October 7, 1992 final notice also provided for a per diem add-on to recognize
the costs incurred by SNFs in complying with the additional nursing home reform requirements of section 1819 of the
Act (including the costs of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluations). (Section 1861(v)(1)(E)
of the Act provides for Medicare payment for costs incurred by SNFs in complying with the requirements of section 1819
of the Act.) The October 7, 1992 notice also included an add-on to the cost limits to recognize the costs that SNFs may
incur in meeting the universal precaution requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
These requirements were described in a final rule published by OSHA in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Provisions of This Final Notice With Comment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. No Changes in the Cost Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), Public Law 103&hyph;66, was enacted.
Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 requires that there be no changes in the SNF routine cost limits (except as may be necessary
to take into account the elimination of the administrative and general add-on for hospital-based SNFs) for cost reporting
periods beginning during Federal fiscal years (FY) 1994 and 1995, that is, for cost reporting periods beginning on
or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1995. The effect of this provision is that a SNF's latest routine cost
limit for a period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and before October 1, 1993, as calculated under the October
7, 1992 notice, without regard to any subsequent adjustments under section 1888(c) of the Act such as exceptions,
will remain in effect until its cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1995. Accordingly, there will
be no changes to a SNF's cost limit for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, and before October
1, 1995, to account for inflation, updates of the data, changes to the wage index or to MSA designations. Thus, in computing
a provider's cost limit for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 and before October 1, 1995,
the cost reporting period adjustment factors that were to apply for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October
1, 1993, as set forth in Table IV of the October 7, 1992 notice (57 FR 46188), will not be used. Other components of the
October 7, 1992 notice, specifically the SNF Group Limits in Table I, and the wage indexes in Tables II and III will continue
to be used to compute the limits, with the exception in Table I of the add-on for administrative and general costs of
hospital-based SNFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the example below, a freestanding SNF in Dallas, Texas has a cost reporting period beginning date of January 1, 1993.
As calculated under the October 7, 1992 notice, its cost limit for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1993 is
$96.97. Under the provisions of this notice, the cost limit of $96.97 will remain in effect for its 12-month cost reporting
periods beginning January 1, 1994 and January 1, 1995. As explained above, the cost reporting period adjustment factors
that would have been used under the October 7, 1992 notice for calculating the limits for the SNF's new cost reporting
periods beginning January 1, 1994 and January 1, 1995, are not used. Accordingly, the provider in this example will
not have any change in its cost limit until its cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1996.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 but before October 1, 1995, a SNF's
cost limit will be its latest routine cost limit for the period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and before October
1, 1993, as calculated under the October 7, 1992 notice and without regard to any subsequent adjustments, such as an
exception to the limit. Thus, if the SNF in the above example received an exception to its cost limit for its cost reporting
period beginning January 1, 1993, its cost limit for the cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1994 would not
include the exception amount for the previous period. To receive an exception or other adjustment to its cost limit,
the SNF would need to submit a request to its fiscal intermediary in accordance with the procedures set forth in &sect;413.30
of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Periods Other Than 12 Months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above methodology applies to providers with cost reporting periods of 12 months in duration. If a facility's cost
reporting period is not 12 months in duration, a special adjustment factor is calculated. This is necessary because
inflation projections are computed to the midpoint of a cost reporting period, and the adjustment factors in Table
IV are based on 12-month reporting periods. For cost reporting periods of other than 12 months, the calculation must
be made based on the midpoint of the specific cost reporting period. The SNF's intermediary obtains this adjustment
factor from HCFA central office. This methodology results in a different cost limit than if a 12-month adjustment
factor were used. However, since the provisions of OBRA '93 require no changes in the cost limit on or after October
1, 1993, the limit calculated with the special adjustment factor will remain in place for subsequent cost reporting
periods beginning before October 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Providers Entering the Medicare Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For providers entering the Medicare program on or after October 1, 1993 and before October 1, 1995, the applicable
cost limit will be the cost limit for the identical period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 through September 30,
1993. For example, if a provider enters the Medicare program on September 1, 1994, with a 12-month cost reporting period,
its cost limit will be determined in the same manner as a cost limit for a period beginning September 1, 1993 and ending
August 30, 1994. If the provider's cost reporting period is a short period beginning September 1, 1994 and ending December
31, 1994, the provider's cost limit will be determined in the same manner as a cost limit for a period beginning September
1, 1993 and ending December 31, 1993. In addition, whether the first period is a full 12-month period or a period other
than 12 months, the cost limit determined for the first period will remain in effect until the provider's first cost
reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1995.

D. Next Update of Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(a) of the Act required that the SNF routine cost
limits be updated on October 1, 1992 and every 2 years thereafter. Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 amended this section
to delay the next update until October 1, 1995, and every 2 years thereafter. Accordingly, there will be no changes
to the routine cost limits published in the October 7, 1992 notice for inflation, changes in the wage index, geographic
designation, or for a more recent data base until October 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Add-On for Hospital-Based SNFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(b) of the Act provided for an add-on to recognize the cost differences
between hospital-based and freestanding SNFs attributable to excess overhead allocations, that is, an add-on for
the administrative and general costs (A&amp;G) of hospital-based SNFs. Section 13503(a)(3) of OBRA '93 amended
this section of the Act to repeal the requirement that we recognize cost differences attributable to excess overhead
allocations. Therefore, this notice implements that provision by eliminating the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based
SNFs. In addition, while section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 requires that there be no changes in the cost limits, as explained
above, it also states that the provision does not apply to the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based
SNFs. Therefore, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, we will no longer apply
the administrative and general add-on for hospital-based SNFs as shown in Table I of the October 7, 1992 schedule of
limits. The intermediary will continue to determine the cost limits for hospital-based SNFs using the relevant instructions
and Table I SNF Group Limits, as described in the October 7, 1992 notice. However, for cost reporting periods beginning
on or after October 1, 1993, these limits will be calculated without using the A&amp;G add-on. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The example below uses information from Table I of the October 7, 1992 schedule of limits to calculate a cost limit for
a hospital-based SNF located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The cost limit is for a cost reporting period beginning October
1, 1993. However, as discussed above, the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based SNFs is no longer applied, and the cost
limit effective October 1, 1992 remains in effect for the cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1993.

F. Adjustments to the Routine Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1888(c) of the Act provides for appropriate adjustments to the SNF routine cost limits. These adjustments
are set forth at &sect;413.30 and include: exemptions from the cost limits for new providers; exceptions to the limits
for atypical services and extraordinary circumstances; and other provisions. Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 mandates
that the effect of allowing no changes in the SNF routine cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning during FYs
1994 and 1995 not be considered in making adjustments to the routine cost limits under the exceptions process. Therefore,
effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1995, a provider
may request an exception only for costs incurred above the amount that the limit would have been had the provisions
set forth in this notice regarding no changes in the cost limits not been enacted. Accordingly, for the purpose of determining
the amount of an exception to the SNF routine cost limits under the regulations at &sect;413.30(f), the difference
between the amount of a provider's cost limit as determined by the provisions set forth in this notice, and the amount
that a provider's cost limit would have been under the October 7, 1992 notice had the provisions described herein not
been enacted, is not subject to an exception to the routine cost limits. We note that this provision does not apply to
the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based SNFs. That is, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993,
the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based SNFs will not be used in computing the amount that the hospital-based cost limit
would have been had the provisions requiring no changes in the limits not been enacted. In addition, we note that this
provision has no effect on new provider exemptions to the SNF cost limits, as set forth under &sect;413.30(e)(2),
since this exemption removes the limitation on a SNF's routine costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The example below demonstrates the computation to determine the amount not subject to an exception under the provisions
set forth in this notice. The provider's cost limit is computed for the cost reporting period beginning January 1,
1993, in accordance with the provisions set forth in this notice, and this limit remains in effect until the cost reporting
period beginning January 1, 1995. The provider has requested an exception to its limit for the period beginning January
1, 1994. Again, we use the information from the October 7, 1992 notice to calculate what the limit would have been had
the OBRA '93 provisions requiring no changes in the limits not been enacted. The difference of $5.04 between the actual
limit and the amount the limit would have been is the amount not subject to an exception.

III. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria
for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Raise a novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in E.O. 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition for final notices such as this, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that this notice
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all
SNFs are treated as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final notice with comment period announces the provisions of section 13503(a) of OBRA '93, which provides for
a delay in the updates of the limits on payments for routine SNF services through cost reporting periods beginning
before October 1, 1995, and provides for the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based SNFs effective
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. None of the provisions of this notice interprets
or extends requirements beyond those set forth in OBRA '93. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 13503(a)(1) and (3) of OBRA '93 will result in significant Federal cost savings. The impact of these provisions
is discussed further below. This notice explains the revised methodology for calculating the SNF limits that results
from the provisions of OBRA '93. We do not believe that merely reflecting these provisions in this notice produces
any effect that will meet any of the criteria of E.O. 12866 for a significant regulatory action or will have a significant
effect on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, we have determined and the Secretary certifies that
neither an impact analysis under E.O. 12866 nor a regulatory flexibility analysis under the RFA are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that a legislative provision being announced by a notice such as this may have a significant effect on
beneficiaries or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns.
In this instance, we believe it is desirable to inform the public of our estimate of the substantial budgetary effect
of these statutory changes. We estimate that these statutory provisions will result in the following savings to the
Medicare program:

As illustrated in Table 2 below, the delay in updating the cost limits until October 1, 1995, combined with the elimination
of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based SNFs, will result in a small increase in the number of SNFs exceeding the SNF
limits in all categories, although we cannot isolate the separate impact of these factors. Table 2 below shows the
combined impact of these changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are unable to identify the effects of these provisions on individual SNFs. However, we anticipate that overall
SNF payments for FY 1994 and FY 1995 will be approximately 1.2 percent and 2.3 percent less, respectively, than they
would have been in those years if the OBRA '93 provisions were not in effect. Moreover, since Medicare does not account
for a high proportion of SNF utilization or revenue, we estimate that the delay in updating the limits and the elimination
of the hospital-based add-on will not result in a significant number of facilities' total revenues being increased
or reduced by 3 percent or more from the October 7, 1992 limits, adjusted for inflation. Thus, we have determined that
the economic impact on SNFs will not be significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final notice such as
this may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have not prepared a rural impact statement since we have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final
notice will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

This final notice with comment period does not impose information collection requirements. Consequently, it need
not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44
U.S.C. 3501 through 3511).

B. Waiver of Proposed Notice and 30-Day Delay in the Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In adopting notices such as this, we ordinarily publish a proposed notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with a 60-day period for public comment as required under section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. We also normally provide a
delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may waive these procedures if we find good
cause that prior notice and comment or a delay in the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to
the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(a) of the Act required that the SNF routine cost
limits be updated for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and every 2 years thereafter. However,
section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 specifies that there be no changes in the SNF cost limits for cost reporting periods
beginning during FYs 1994 and 1995, and section 13503(a)(2) of OBRA '93 amended section 1888 of the Act to delay the
next required update of the SNF limits until October 1, 1995. In addition, section 13503(a)(3) of OBRA '93 amended
section 1888(b) of the Act to eliminate, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993,
the add-on to the SNF cost limits to recognize the higher administrative and general costs of hospital-based SNFs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conformance with the clear direction of section 13503(a) of OBRA '93, this notice announces the new SNF provisions
and explains the effects of these provisions on the methodology used in calculating the SNF cost limits. We have made
no changes in this methodology beyond those directly required by OBRA '93, nor are there any other discretionary aspects
to this notice. Moreover, section 13503(a) of OBRA '93 mandates that these provisions are effective beginning with
cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. Thus, we have concluded that in this instance, it would
be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to publish a proposed notice or to provide for
a 30-day delay in the effective date of this notice. Therefore, we find good cause to waive publication of a proposed
notice and the 30-day delay in effective date. However, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated
at the beginning of this preamble.

Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive, we are not able to acknowledge or respond
to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``Date''
section of the preamble to this notice. If we make any changes to this notice, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to the notice that incorporates the changes.

for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference and Proposed Funding Priority for Grants for Establishment
of Departments of Family Medicine for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announces that applications for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted under the authority of section 747(b), (previously section 780) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act,
title VII, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408,
dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentage for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant
Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference, and proposed funding priority
stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately $9.4 million will be available for the Grants for Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine
program in FY 1994. Total continuation support recommended is $5.7 million. It is anticipated that $3.7 million will
be available to support approximately 22 competing awards averaging $170,000.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 747(b) of the PHS Act authorizes support to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine to meet the costs
of projects to establish, maintain, or improve family medicine academic administrative units (which may be departments,
divisions, or other units) to provide clinical instruction in family medicine. Funds awarded will be used to: (l)
Plan and develop model educational predoctoral, faculty development and graduate medical education programs in
family medicine which will meet the requirements of section 747(a), by the end of the project period of section 747(b)
support; and (2) support academic and clinical activities relevant to the field of family medicine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program may also assist schools to strengthen the administrative base and structure that is responsible for the
planning, direction, organization, coordination, and evaluation of all undergraduate and graduate family medicine
activities. Funds are to complement rather than duplicate programmatic activities for actual operation of family
medicine training programs under section 747(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 50 competing applications for the Grants for Departments of Family Medicine program. Of
those applications 82 percent were approved and 18 percent were disapproved. Twelve projects, or 24 percent of applications
received, were funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1992, HRSA reviewed 71 competing applications. Of those applications, 66 percent were approved and 34 percent
were disapproved. Thirty-six projects, or about 50 percent of the applications received, were funded.

General Statutory Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settings having the principal focus of serving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents of medically underserved communities; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which an award is sought, has achieved a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settings. This preference will only be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications that rank above the 20th percentile that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been recommended for approval by the peer review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``High rate'' means that 20 percent of all graduates of the medical school in 1989 or 1990, whichever is greater, are
spending at least 50 percent of their work time in clinical practice in the specified settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate
of placing 1989 or 1990 graduates in the specified settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than
15 percent of graduates from the most recent year (1990) are working in these settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Establishment and Expansion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;408 has amended section 747(b), (previously section 780) to include the following statutory
funding preference for this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 747(b)(2) provides that preference shall be given to any qualified applicant that agrees to expend the award
for one of the following purposes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Establishing an academic administrative unit (defined as a department, division, or other unit), for programs
in family medicine; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Substantially expanding the programs of such a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A program will meet the definition of ``substantial expansion'' if it has developed an acceptable plan for a 50 percent
increase in a sufficient number of the following areas to qualify for 70 points. The expansion must be completed within
3 years.

II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13,
1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the
rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately $1,791,000 will be available in FY 1994 for this program. Total continuation support recommended
is $1,316,000. It is anticipated that approximately $475,000 will be available to support 5 competing awards averaging

Other Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores of individual approved applications
when applications meet specified criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In making awards of grants under this section, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_(A) has a high
rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved
communities; or (B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved
a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. Preference will be given only for applications
ranked above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the appropriate peer
review group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1990&hyph;91, 1991&hyph;92 or 1992&hyph;93
who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Graduates who are providing
care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The purpose of this exchange is to acquire non-Federal lands in the Three Rivers area with important scenic, riparian,
and access values. This exchange will consolidate the Bureau lands and reduce the number of scattered, isolated Bureau
tracts that are difficult for the Bureau to manage. The public interest will be well served upon completion of this
exchange.

of any of the land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized.
Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest
no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are
governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes
between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
plans describe actions necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels
for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice, and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Key Largo woodrat and cotton mouse were listed as endangered species on August 31, 1984. Both species require tropical
hardwood hammock forests for food and cover. An estimated 6,500 woodrats and 18,000 cotton mice occur on 2,100 acres
of forested uplands. Both species originally occurred throughout all of the hardwood hammocks of Key Largo, but are
now restricted to only north Key Largo, representing about one-half their original distribution. Primary threats
to these species include habitat destruction and fragmentation, road mortality, and vulnerability to catastrophic
events such as storms or fires. Current habitat acquisition by both the State and Federal governments will provide
nearly complete public ownership for the remaining hardwood hammocks on north Key Largo. Specific recovery actions
include additional habitat purchase and protection and the future reestablishment of both species to the southern
portion of Key Largo.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gulf sturgeon, a subspecies of the Atlantic sturgeon 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acipenser oxyrinchus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, was listed as a threatened species on September 30, 1991. The Gulf sturgeon is an anadromous fish which migrates from
salt water into large coastal rivers to spawn and spend the warmer months. The majority of its life is spent in fresh
water. The current population levels of Gulf sturgeon in rivers other than the Suwannee and Apalachicola rivers are
unknown, but are thought to be reduced from historic levels. Historically, the subspecies occurred in most major
rivers from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River, and marine waters of the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico
to Florida Bay. Major factors in the decline of the Gulf sturgeon include barriers (dams) to historical spawning habitats,
habitat loss, water quality degradation, and overfishing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recovery plan for the Gulf sturgeon was prepared by a Recovery Team containing members from the States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, the National Marine Fisheries
Service, the National Biological Survey, university researchers, commercial fishing interests, conservation
organizations, and the Service. The draft plan currently available for public comment resulted from a technical
review during the summer of 1992. Major recovery actions include identifying and restoring essential habitats of
the Gulf sturgeon. Initial restoration efforts will focus on riverine habitats. Another recovery action includes
reducing incidental catch of the fish by commercial fishermen. The ultimate recovery goal for the Gulf sturgeon is
to establish population levels that would allow delisting of the fish in selected river systems. After delisting,
the goal is to establish populations that could support commercial fishing in those selected river systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two Hernando County plants 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campanula robinsiae 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Brooksville bellflower) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Justicia cooleyi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Cooley's water-willow) were listed as endangered species on August 28, 1989. Brooksville bellflower inhabits
wet ``prairies'' and lake margins in the hill country of Hernando County. Cooley's water-willow primarily inhabits
hardwood forests, but appears to persist or thrive in clearings, pastures, and roadsides. Its distribution appears
to be primarily in the hills of Hernando County, but it is also known from Sumter County, near Mascotte. The draft recovery
plan emphasizes better information on the life history of the bellflower, an annual that grows in late winter and is
often under water. For Cooley's water-willow, immediate efforts are needed to control the spread of alien pest vines,
especially air-potato (a tropical yam that produces tubers on its vines) and skunkvine (an Asian vine that can cover
the ground in a forest, and whose leaves have a fecal odor when brused). Recovery efforts for these plants will begin
on land owned by Federal and State agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphorbia telephioides
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scutellaria floridana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Florida skullcap). The fourth species, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pinguicula ionantha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Godfrey's butterwort) was listed as a threatened species on July 12, 1993. These four plants overlap in their distributions
and habitats in the low-lying outer Coastal Plain near the Apalachicola River, roughly from the southwestern portion
of Apalachicola National Forest west to Panama City. Telephus spurge occupies low sand ridges. White birds-in-a-nest
and Florida skullcap occur in grassy pinelands and savannahs; Godfrey's butterwort occurs in savannahs, bogs, and
seasonal ponds. Three of the four species occur in Apalachicola National Forest, where ongoing management, especially
prescribed burning, is needed to ensure that they are secure. Telephus spurge, which does not occur on public land,
and the other species outside of Apalachicola National Forest are threatened by habitat degradation due to lack of
prescribed fire and by forestry practices, including planting practices. The recovery plan calls for ensuring that
habitat for the three plants is appropriately managed in the National Forest and, to the extent feasible, privately-owned
habitat be protected through conservation easements or purchase by public conservation agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This meeting is part of a series on developing a geospatial data framework for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure.
The framework will provide a minimum set of geographic data that is useful to a maximum number of users within any geographic
area or nationwide. Framework data will be produced to known standards in the fastest time frame possible and for the
most reasonable cost. Creation of such a geospatial data framework will eliminate much of the redundancy in data capture
by making available a basic set of geospatial data to which other data can be related. The framework data would be of
recognized quality and would be available in ``standard'' formats. The geospatial data framework also will provide
a means to integrate data from numerous collection activities in various agencies and will encourage data sharing
among different disciplines. The components of the framework will likely include digital ortho imagery, geographic
and cadastral reference systems, elevation, and spatial representations of transportation, hydrography, and
administrative and political units. This meeting will address elevation and cadastral data; subsequent meeting
will address the other themes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Framework Working Group consists of representatives of Federal, State, regional, and local government agencies
engaged in the collection, maintenance, and development of geospatial data. The working group will define the components,
identify the standards for the initial collection and maintenance, recommend a time frame for production and maintenance,
and develop a plan for funding a framework of geospatial data as the foundation for the NSDI.

The following notice appeared in the Commerce Business Daily on Monday, December 20, 1993:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is a reissuance of a notice published on 12/7/93 and is for the same RFP. Any requests for this RFP that have
already been submitted in response to the earlier notice will be honored, and a new request is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is soliciting proposals for up to two contracts to provide
public administration services throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Activities under the contract(s) will be
focused primarily in Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Albania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and possibly
the republics of the former Yugoslavia, and secondarily, in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each contract term is expected to be for two years, with the option to extend the contract(s) for 50% of the level of effort
in the 2-year base period. The contract(s) will be based on a level-of-effort, and contract resources will be accessed
through individual Technical Service Orders (TSOs). In addition, the contract(s) will provide a set amount of funds
for equipment and U.S.-based training for which the Contractor will be logistically responsible. Contractor(s)
shall furnish qualified personnel to provide technical assistance and training in the field of public administration
in, but not limited to, the following categories of activity: public management training, personnel systems, organizational
management, budgeting systems, regulatory systems, transparency of process, accountability, decentralization,
intergovernmental finance, local self-governments, procurement, and future public administrators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the scope of activities, USAID encourages proposals from consortia or organizations joining together under
one proposal. All responsible sources may submit a proposal to be considered by USAID. Proposals will be evaluated
in accordance with the selection criteria stated in the RFP, with award(s) based on the proposal(s) that are most advantageous
to the Government, cost and other factors considered. To help identify potential subcontractors, the RFP will contain
an attachment listing all organizations who requested the RFP up to the time the RFP goes to print. By providing a list,
USAID does not endorse any of the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID
verify the claimed status of the organizations known to USAID prior to the issuance of the RFP. All requestors are encouraged
to state in their requests for the RFP whether their organization is a small business or a disadvantaged enterprise.
USAID promotes participation of small business concerns and disadvantaged enterprises (firms owned by minorities
or women, historically black colleges and universities, college and universities with more than 40 percent Hispanic
American students, and private voluntary organizations controlled by minorities or women) as contractors or subcontractors.
Accordingly, the prime contractor(s) will make reasonable efforts to identify the use of such groups. All other selection
criteria being equal, the participation of such groups may be a determining factor for selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one request for the RFP per organization will be honored. The RFP will be available approximately 15 days after
issuance of this notice. Interested parties may obtain a copy of the RFP by submitting a written request, citing RFP
number OP/A/EE&hyph;94&hyph;P&hyph;003, with one self-addressed mailing label to Dana Doo-Soghoian, U.S. Agency
for International Development, Office of Procurement, M/OP/A/EE, room 1566, SA&hyph;14, Washington, DC 20523&hyph;1426.
Only written requests will be honored. Parties interested in obtaining a copy of the RFP after its issuance may request
a copy in person by presenting a written request with the organization mailing address to the 15th Floor Receptionist,
1100 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22209. To expedite receipt of the RFP, organization requesting the RFP may provide
a self-addressed envelope already prepared for mailing with either their Federal Express or Express Mail account
number. If an envelope already prepared for mailing is not provided by the requestor, the RFP will be mailed through
the regular U.S. Postal Service. Telephonic requests will not be honored. Requests for the RFP that are received one
week or less before the RFP closing date will be filled subject to the availability of copies. (0350)

On May 14, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Abel J. Sands, M.D. (Respondent) of 316 South Midwest Boulevard, Midwest City,
Oklahoma 73110. The Order to Show Cause, which proposed to deny Respondent's application for registration pursuant
to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. The
Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent issued prescriptions for controlled substances to undercover agents
of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (OBN) for other than legitimate medical purposes; that
OBN took action against Respondent's state license to handle controlled substances; and that Respondent failed
to keep complete and accurate records of this purchasing and dispensing of controlled substances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing and the matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge
Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on December
15, 1992. On September 8, 1993, the administrative law judge issued her findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended
ruling. On September 30, 1993, Respondent filed exceptions to the recommended ruling of the administrative law judge.
On October 12, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding to the Administrator.
Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Acting Administrator hereby issues
his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was proven at the hearing that on numerous occasions, Respondent wrote prescriptions to undercover agents in the
absence of a legitimate medical purpose. OBN first became aware of Respondent's prescribing practices after Respondent's
name arose in the course of an investigation into the street purchase of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance,
Valium and Xanax, both Schedule IV controlled substances. OBN agents posed as patients and visited Respondent's
office in an attempt to obtain prescriptions for controlled substances without legitimate medical reason. The OBN
agents conducted a total of seven successful undercover operations at Respondent's office between December 1988
and April 1989. On each occasion, the OBN agents were able to obtain prescriptions for Xanax without legitimate medical
purpose. All of these undercover operations were taped and transcribed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the first undercover visit on December 14, 1988, the undercover agent told Respondent that a friend from whom he
had been purchasing Xanax advised him that he could obtain a prescription for Respondent. The agent told Respondent
that the Xanax made him ``feel good.'' After initially refusing to provide the prescription, Respondent informed
the agent that he would make a patient chart for him, the charge for which would be $25.00. Respondent proceeded to perform
a cursory examination of the agent, which included taking his weight and blood pressure. The agent told Respondent
that he needed Xanax to ``function'' at work after he used cocaine. Respondent ultimately provided the agent with
a prescription for 60 Xanax, stating that writing for 100 would get him (Respondent) in ``trouble.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBN agents conducted similar undercover operations on six other occasions and obtained prescriptions for Xanax
each time. The lead agent testified, and the transcripts provided corroboration, that he never complained of any
medical problem which warranted the use of Xanax. The administrative law judge determined that Respondent did not
establish a physician-patient relationship with the OBN agents and concluded that none of the prescriptions at issue
was for a legitimate medical purpose.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative law judge further noted that Respondent's taped comments to the OBN agents demonstrated that
he was aware of the illegitimacy of the prescriptions and was concerned that his conduct would become known to law enforcement.
As a result, the administrative law judge concluded that Respondent's contention that he issued the prescriptions
pursuant to a valid physician-patient relationship was disingenuous and did not ``bode well for the proposition
that [Respondent] is likely in the future to accept and discharge the responsibilities of a DEA registrant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also proven at the administrative hearing was the fact that Respondent, after surrendering his DEA Certificate of
Registration and after his state controlled substance license had been suspended, was found to be in possession of
controlled substances. On January 29, 1990, OBN agents and DEA Diversion Investigators delivered to Respondent
an ``imminent danger letter'' from OBN, which suspended Respondent's state controlled substance registration.
The same day, Respondent signed a DEA Form 104, voluntarily surrendering his DEA Certificate of Registration. An
investigation by Medical Board investigators revealed that on June 4, 1990, Respondent was in possession of Equagesic
and Halcion, both controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Medical Board investigation also revealed that Respondent had failed to keep accurate records of his purchase
and dispensing of controlled substances. After a Medical Board hearing was scheduled, but before the hearing date,
the Medical Board proposed and Respondent accepted a five year probation period during which Respondent was prohibited
from prescribing, administering or dispensing any Schedule II or III controlled substances. On April 16, 1991, OBN
granted Respondent a state controlled substance registration limited to Schedules IV and V for the period of his Medical
Board probation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator also finds that on November 15, 1989, Respondent was indicted in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on seven counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 842(a)(1). This indictment was based
on Respondent's writing of prescriptions to the undercover OBN agents. Respondent was acquitted of all charges on
February 22, 1990, following a jury trial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration or deny
an application for registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.
Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State
licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting
research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws
relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance with applicable
State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which may threaten the
public health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application
should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks,
M.D., 51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly found that all these factors, with the exception
of 21 U.S.C. 823(f)(3), were relevant to a determination of whether Respondent's registration would be in the public
interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two Oklahoma authorities which exercise control over the licensing of physicians, OBN, which issues controlled
substances registrations, and the Oklahoma Medical Board (Medical Board), which issues medical licenses, have
taken action against Respondent. With respect to Respondent's experience with dispensing controlled substances,
the OBN investigation clearly demonstrates that Respondent cannot be trusted to fulfill his responsibilities as
a DEA registrant. This conduct, combined with his recordkeeping violations as discovered by the Medical Board, indicates
that Respondent has not complied with Federal and State regulations relating to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Respondent's cavalier conduct when issuing prescriptions, as evidenced by comments made during the undercover
operations, is disturbing. As the Administrative law judge correctly noted, the transcripts clearly indicate that
Respondent was aware of the illegality of his actions. Respondent's knowledge of the illicit nature of his conduct
demonstrates that Respondent cannot fulfill the significant responsibilities which come with a DEA registration.
Additionally, it is further evidence that the public health and safety would be comprised were Respondent given the
opportunity to return to his prior conduct. After considering these elements, the administrative law judge concluded
that Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and recommended that Respondent's application
be denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 30, 1993, Respondent filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's recommended decision. In these
exceptions, Respondent took issue with the administrative law judge's reliance on the testimony of the OBN agent
and the transcripts of the undercover operations. Respondent maintained that the agent's credibility was damaged
given the discrepancies between his testimony before the grand jury and his testimony during the criminal trial.
The Acting Administrator finds, however, that the administrative law judge carefully considered these issues and
concluded that the alleged inconsistencies in testimonies did not affect the administrative hearing. The inconsistencies
were adequately explained by the agent at the administrative hearing. Furthermore, as the administrative law judge
correctly noted, some of the agent's statements which Respondent insisted were contradictory were not necessarily
inconsistent. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the transcripts of the undercover operations, the accuracy
of which was not challenged by Respondent, speak for themselves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent asserts that the administrative law judge did not base her opinion on all the evidence presented, and instead
relied exclusively on the transcripts of the undercover operations. This contention, however, is not supported
by the detailed opinion and recommended ruling prepared by the administrative law judge. The Acting Administrator
finds that the administrative law judge properly weighed the evidence presented by both the Government and Respondent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator agrees with the administrative law judge that, after considering the applicable factors
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and adopts her recommended
decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant
to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that Abel J. Sands' application
for registration be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective January 6, 1994.

Notice of Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Notice is hereby given that Wyle Laboratories (WL) has made application pursuant to section 6(b) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, (84 Stat. 1593, 29 U.S.C. 655), Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1&hyph;90 (55 FR 9033),
and 29 CFR 1910.7 for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The address of the laboratory covered by this application is: Wyle Laboratories, 7800 Governors Drive, P.O. Box 077777,
Huntsville, Alabama 35807.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the merits of the application, the applicant contends that it meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for
recognition to certify products in the areas of testing which it has specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyle Laboratories states that its application demonstrates that for each specified item of equipment or material
to be certified, it has the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written
testing procedures, quality control and calibration programs) to perform testing and examination of equipment
and materials for workplace safety purposes to determine conformance with appropriate product test standards.
In summary, it claims that it has the experience, expertise, personnel, organization, equipment, and facilities
suitable for accreditation as an OSHA Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Calibration Laboratory maintains, repairs, and calibrates more than 7400 pieces of test equipment. Test equipment
is available in the laboratory to perform the testing specified in the standard. If equipment is not available, it
may be purchased, rented, or leased only under specified, stringent conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant states that it has pertinent testing and certification experience. The Huntsville facility has been
conducting testing related to product safety for over 30 years. Since the commercial product safety market has only
recently become available, WL's experience has been in other markets including telecommunications. The applicant
states the WL has tested equipment to standards which compare with UL standards for which they are requesting accreditation
to test and certify as an NRTL. In addition, Wyle has had experience in the certification of products (although not
necessarily related to those required by OSHA), having been a certified Department of Transportation (DOT) Third
Party Testing Laboratory since July, 1985. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WL's Huntsville facility employs some 350 people and has about 320,000 square feet of engineering and test facilities
situated on 126 acres. The floor space of the Product Safety Testing and Certification Laboratory including the storage
and office area, is 2,700 square feet. Some twenty key personnel are presently assigned to this Division including
Calibration Laboratory and Quality staff. Product safety testing has been allocated 1,500 square feet of floor space.
If additional floor space is necessary for product testing, WL can expand into the 320,000 square feet that is available
at this facility. (See Exhibits 3.A.(1) and 2.A.(2), Appendices II and III, and IV).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WL has written testing procedures and has supplied examples of typical procedures for five of the test standards for
which it has applied for NRTL recognition. (See Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix VI).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyle Laboratories states that all instrumentation, measuring, and test equipment used in the performance of the
testing programs are calibrated in accordance with Wyle Laboratories' Quality Assurance Program. Standards used
in performing all calibrations are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by report
number and date. Where no national standards exist, the standards are traceable to international standards or the
basis for calibration is otherwise documented. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 10, and Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix
VIII, Section 12, and Appendix XII).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Wyle Laboratories states that it will implement control procedures for identifying products which have been certified.
It will maintain a controlled and secure file for each product tested. This file will contain the technical and business
records of the test program, including the services agreement, test results, correspondence, transmittals, the
Factory Inspection Reports, and the product documentation. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant further states that products bearing the Wyle label will be considered evaluated, certified, and listed
by Wyle. It will certify that these products are in compliance with the applicable safety standards to which they were
tested. Wyle will thereafter have unannounced and unrestricted access to conduct inspections at approximately
three-month intervals at manufacturing and other facilities where products certified by them may be fabricated,
processed, or stored. Wyle will conduct field inspections to monitor and assure proper use of its certification label
after the products are delivered to the end user. (See Exhibit 2.A(1), Sections 5 and 9, and Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix
XI).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WL states that its Product Safety Certification activities are performed completely independent of its clients.
No Wyle clients have ownership positions in Wyle or have any sort of influence on WL's activities. No WL employees are
under the influence or control of manufacturers or suppliers. (See Exhibits 2.A; 2.A.(1), Section 3; and Exhibits
2.A.(2), Appendix I).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The applicant states that Wyle Laboratories was founded in 1949 in El Segundo, California, as an independent test
laboratory to support the nation's fledgling aerospace industry. As manned spaceflight became a national priority
and support of spaceflight development was required, Wyle expanded to a new location in Norco, California, which
was dedicated in 1959. To complement the propellent and vibration testing capabilities of the California locations,
Wyle states that it created the Huntsville facility in 1962 to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) and the establishment of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, with testing,
engineering, and research capabilities. Of the three major operations at the Huntsville facility, the one of interest
to the NRTL Accreditation program is the Test Operations Division, which includes the Product Safety Department.
The Product Safety Testing and Certification Division of the Test Operations Division is responsible for the testing,
certification, and factory follow-up inspections of the products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant states that over its 42 year history, Wyle Laboratories_Scientific &amp; Systems (3S) Group has expended
and diversified into various business disciplines. At the same time, the applicant states that the Company has continuously
maintained its independent laboratory status as a major provider of conformity assessment services to North America's
most quality-conscious industries. Wyle's focus continues to be on the science of evaluation, test and measurement
engineering, as well as the business of regulatory compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyle Laboratories desires recognition for testing and certification of products when tested for compliance with

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Preliminary Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Wyle Laboratories addressed all of the criteria which must be met for recognition as an NRTL in its initial application
and in its further correspondence. For example, the applicant submitted a list of its test equipment and instrumentation;
a roster of its personnel including resumes of those in key positions and copies of position descriptions; copies
of a typical test report; a factory inspection form and an inspection summary; a summary of its listing, labeling,
and follow-up services; a statement of its independence as a testing laboratory; appeals procedure; typical calibration
forms; and a copy of its Quality Assurance Manual. This QA Manual includes a description of its document control; identification
and control of materials, parts, and components; inspection; test control; control of measuring and test equipment;
inspection, test, and operating status; quality assurance records; and audits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine major areas were examined in depth during the on-site laboratory evaluation: Facility; test equipment; calibration
program; test and evaluation procedures; test reports; records; quality assurance program; follow-up listing
program; and personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discrepancies noted during the on-site evaluation were adequately responded to [Ex. 3.A.(2)] prior to the preparation
of the final on-site evaluation [Ex. 3. A.(1)]. With the preparation of the final report, the survey team was satisfied
that the testing facility appeared to meet the necessary criteria required by the standard, and so noted in the On-Site
Review Report (Survey). (See Ex. 3.A.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review of the application file and the on-site survey report of the WL facility, the NRTL Recognition Program
staff concluded that the applicant appeared to have met the requirements for recognition as a Nationally Recognized
Testing Laboratory and, therefore, recommended to the Assistant Secretary that the application be preliminarily
approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon a review of the completed application file and the recommendation of the staff, the Assistant Secretary
has made a preliminary finding that Wyle Laboratories can meet the requirements for recognition as required by 29
CFR 1910.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All interested members of the public are invited to supply detailed reasons and evidence supporting or challenging
the sufficiency of the applicant's having met the requirements for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing
Laboratory, as well as Appendix A, of 29 CFR 1910.7. Submission of pertinent written documents and exhibits shall
be made no later than March 7, 1994 and must be addressed to the NRTL Recognition Program, Office of Variance Determination,
Room N 3653, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Third Street and Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Copies of the WL application, the laboratory survey report, and all submitted
comments, as received, (Docket No. NRTL&hyph;1&hyph;93), are available for inspection and duplication at the Docket
Office, room N 2634, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, at the above address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Secretary's final decision on whether the applicant satisfies the requirements for recognition as
an NRTL will be made on the basis of the entire record including the public submissions and any further proceedings
that the Assistant Secretary may consider appropriate in accordance with Appendix A of &sect;1910.7.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an extension to the latest construction
completion date specified in Construction Permit No. CPPR&hyph;149 issued to The Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company, et al., for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 2. The facility is located on the applicant's site in Lake County,
Ohio, approximately 35 miles northeast of Cleveland, Ohio and approximately 7 miles northeast of Painesville, Ohio.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would extend the latest construction completion date of Construction Permit No. CPPR&hyph;149
to November 30, 2001. The proposed action is in response to the applicant's request of October 28, 1991, as supplemented
on February 20, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is needed because the construction of the facility is not yet completed and the licensee wants
to maintain the facility as a potential electrical power source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the proposed action involves extending the construction permit, there are no radiological impacts associated
with this action. The impacts that are involved are all non-radiological and are associated with continued construction.
The impact of construction was evaluated in the Final Environmental Statement for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant,
Units 1 and 2 (NUREG&hyph;0844, dated August 1982).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the NRC staff concludes that the proposed extension of the construction permit would have
no significant environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A possible alternative to the proposed action would be to deny the request. Under this alternative, the applicant
would not be able to complete construction of the facility. This would result in denial of the potential benefit of
the facility. This option would not eliminate the environmental impacts of construction already incurred. If construction
were halted and not completed, site redress activities would restore some small areas to their natural state. This
would be a slight environmental benefit, but much outweighed by the economic losses from denial of the use of the facility,
if completed. Therefore, this alternative is rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative is to take no action on the request for extension. The construction permit would not be deemed
to have expired until the application has been finally processed (10 CFR 2.109). In effect, the construction permit
could be in effect as long as no action was taken on a timely application for an extension. To take no action on the applicant's
request would not be responsive; therefore, this alternative is rejected.

Alternative Use of Resources

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources other that those evaluated in the Final Environmental Statement,
NUREG&hyph;0884, dated August 1982, prepared as part of the NRC staff's review of the construction permit application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff reviewed the applicant's request and applicable documents referenced therein that support this extension.
The NRC did not consult other agencies or persons.

Finding of No Significant Impact

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for this action. Based upon the environmental
assessment, we conclude that this action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;49, issued to Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Duane
Arnold Energy Center (DAEC), located in Linn County, Iowa.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would consist of a change to the Operating License that would increase the storage capacity of the spent
fuel pool to 3152 fuel assemblies, including a rack which can be used for temporary storage of 323 fuel assemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment to the TS is responsive to the licensee's application dated March 26, 1993, and supplemented by additional
correspondence dated September 15 and November 23, 1993. The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment
of the proposed action.

Summary of Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor
Fuel'' (NUREG&hyph;0575), Volumes 1&hyph;3 (1979), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage
of spent fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation
of nuclear power with the accompanying spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommended
evaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis. For DAEC, the expansion of the storage capacity of
the spent fuel pool will not create any significant additional radiological effects or nonradiological environmental
impacts beyond those assessed in the Commission's Final Environmental Statement (FES) issued in March 1973 related
to the operation of DAEC, and in the Safety Evaluation Report issued July 7, 1978, in support of a previous license amendment
concerning storage capacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expanded spent fuel pool is estimated to be less
than 2 percent of the total annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facility relative to the requirements set forth
in 10 CFR part 51. Based on this assessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological
impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have
no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, no environmental
impact statement needs to be prepared for this action.

By letter dated September 13, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, from the DAC values
for Kr&hyph;89 and Xe&hyph;137 in Table 1 of appendix B to 10 CFR part 20 and provided alternative values in order to
use more appropriate specific DAC values for these radionuclides. The requested exemption would constitute a permanent
change to the Final Rule values for Kr&hyph;89 and Xe&hyph;137 for the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the NRC staff evaluation, it was calculated that the dose equivalent, in units of rem, that corresponds to
an exposure of 2,000 hours at the requested DACs of 10

 uCi/cm for Xe&hyph;137 is below the limiting dose values used for determining the radionuclide-specific DAC values
in Appendix B to 10 CFR 20.001&hyph;20.2402 (and in Federal Guidance Report No. 11). Therefore, the staff finds the
specific DAC values acceptable alternatives for use in place of the generic DAC value of 10

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, the requested exemption from the DAC
values for Kr&hyph;89 and Xe&hyph;137 in Table 1 of Appendix A to 10 CFR part 20 and use of the values specified in the
licensee's request is authorized by law, and will not result in undue hazard to life or property. The exemption request
has been evaluated in a Safety Evaluation dated December 29, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants BECo and exemption from the values in the Final Rule for Kr&hyph;89 and Xe&hyph;137
and approves the use of the proposed values in their request when determining whether an area is, and requires posting
as, an airborne radioactivity area. This exemption constitutes a permanent change to the applicability of the Regulations
in this regard for the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., (the licensee), is the holder of Provisional Operating License
No. DPR&hyph;5 which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Indian Point Station, Unit 1 (IP&hyph;1). The
license provides, among other things, that the plant is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission
now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plant is a permanently shutdown light water reactor located at the licensee site in Westchester County, New York.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IP&hyph;1 has been shut down since October 31, 1974. There is presently no fuel in the reactor and, under the terms of
an April 14, 1977 amendment to License No. DPR&hyph;5 (Appendix A, Technical Specification 3.2.1), no fuel may be
loaded into the reactor core or moved into the reactor containment building without prior review and authorization
by the Commission. In addition, the Commission revoked authority to operate IP&hyph;1 by order dated June 19, 1980.
In order to reflect the permanently shutdown and defueled status of the plant, the NRC is granting an exemption from
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.120. This rule states the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This exemption will relieve the licensee from all training program requirements of 10 CFR 50.120. However, it does
not relieve the licensee from previous requirements or commitments to train and qualify facility personnel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), are (1) authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) present special circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 50.12(a)(2)(ii) of 10 CFR part 50 provides that special circumstances exist when application of the regulations
in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the
underlying purpose of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of 10 CFR 50.120 is to ensure that civilian nuclear power plant operating personnel are trained and qualified
to safely operate and maintain the facility commensurate with the safety status of the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee in its letter dated July 31, 1993, addressed the special circumstances related to the NRC requiring the
Indian Point training programs to comply with 10 CFR 50.120. The reactor is permanently shut down, defueled, and the
fuel moved to the spent fuel pool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has stated that the training requirements necessary to assure adequate protection of the public health
and safety in a permanently shutdown and defueled facility are significantly less than the training requirements
necessary to assure the public health and safety at an operating facility. The current Indian Point training programs
for the personnel categories required by 10 CFR 50.120 are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tasks and activities associated with maintaining the fuel are relatively simple compared to the tasks and activities
required to maintain an operating nuclear power plant. Therefore, requiring IP&hyph;1 to comply with the literal
training requirements specified in 10 CFR 50.120 is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee contends that the regulation was established for power operation conditions because such conditions
could result in the potential for an accident with significant offsite consequences. In an NRC Show Cause Order to
Consolidated Edison dated February 11, 1980, the NRC stated that the NRC and the licensee had performed calculations
that showed that the spent fuel fission products had decayed such that, in the event of a loss of water from the spent
fuel pool, the fuel would adequately cool in air. Since February 11, 1980, the spent fuel radionuclides have decayed
an additional 13 years which further reduces the heat load in the event of a loss of water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff has also determined that the tasks that remain to be performed by the IP&hyph;1 staff are fewer in number and
significantly less complicated than the tasks performed by the staff of an operating nuclear plant. Thus, the NRC
staff concludes the licensee justification for exemption is reasonable based on (1) the significantly reduced risk
to the public health and safety due to IP&hyph;1 being permanently shut down, and (2) the reduced number and complexity
of tasks to be performed by the IP&hyph;1 site staff.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the analyses presented in Section III above, the staff concludes that sufficient bases exits for approval
of this exemption. In addition, the staff finds that the special circumstance present satisfies the requirement
of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) in that requiring compliance with 10 CFR 50.120 is not necessary to achieve the underlying
purpose of the rule.

Based on the above evaluation, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(1), this exemption
is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common
defense and security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants Indian Point Station Unit 1 and exemption to 10 CFR 50.120. This exemption
does not relieve the licensee of any other training requirements or commitments which they have made to the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant

Appendix A of part 20 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, ``Protection Factors for Respirators,'' establishes
protection factors of air-purifying respirators for protection against particulates only. Furthermore, footnoted
d&hyph;2(c) states, ``No allowance is to be made for the use of sorbents against radioactive material in the form of
gases or vapors.'' This restriction was needed since an inadequate data base has existed for evaluating the complex
interaction of many factors affecting the service life and removal efficiency of radioactive gases and vapors by
sorbent canisters. Also, due to the lack of a data base, a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health/Mine
Safety and Health Administration (NIOSH/MSHA) certification schedule has not been established to ensure that the
canisters meet acceptable performance criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 20.103(e) of 10 CFR part 20 allows the Commission to authorize the use of respiratory equipment in lieu of an
NIOSH/MSHA certification when such an action is justified based on adequate testing of material and performance
characteristics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 19, 1991, as supplemented by letters dated July 1, 1993, and November 3, 1993, HL&amp;P requested
an exemption based on 10 CFR 20.501 to allow the use of radioiodine Mine Safety Appliance Company (MSA) GMR&hyph;1
canisters with a protection factor of 50 for personnel respiratory protection. In support of the exemption request,
HL&amp;P cited test results and a quality assurance plan that satisfies the recommended qualification process of
NUREG/CR&hyph;3403, ``Criteria and Test Methods for Certifying Air-Purifying Respirator Cartridges and Canisters
Against Radioiodine.''

The NRC staff evaluated the information provided by HL&amp;P. The licensee provided reliable test information verifying
that the MSA GMR&hyph;1 canister is capable of providing a protection factor of 50 over a period of 8 hours of continuous
use, provided that the total challenge of radioactive and non-radioactive iodine and other halogenated compounds
does not exceed 1 ppm, and temperature does not exceed 110
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F provided the dewpoint does not exceed 107
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. The data showed the breakthrough point to be well beyond 8 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing has been conducted under acceptable conditions of cyclic flow and under worst-case conditions for those
environmental factors affecting service life (i.e., temperature, relative humidity, and challenge concentration

I (methyliodide/methyl radioiodide), the most penetrating of the challenge forms). The data showed that the MSA
GMR&hyph;I canisters performed adequately under acceptable test conditions. These conditions, including criteria
and test methods, are consistent with those derived by the NRC staff from NUREG/CR&hyph;3403, ``Criteria and Test
Methods for Certifying Air-Purifying Respirator Cartridges and Canisters Against Radioiodine.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HL&amp;P, through acceptance of MSA QA controls, has provided commitments that the MSA GMR&hyph;1 canisters will
meet standards for quality assurance and quality control that are recognized by NIOSH and are compatible with NRC
staff positions. This includes a commitment to establish a 1 percent AQL (acceptable quality limit) in a 5 to 10 ppm
challenge concentration of CH

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) has initiated a review to determine if Belarus meets the designation criteria
of the GSP law and should be designated as a beneficiary. The GSP is provided for in the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19
U.S.C. 2461&hyph;2465). The designation criteria are listed in 19 U.S.C. 2462(a), 2462(b) and 2462(c). Interested
parties are invited to submit comments regarding the eligibility of Belarus for designation as a GSP beneficiary.
The designation criteria mandate determinations related to participation in commodity cartels, preferential
treatment provided by beneficiaries to other developed countries, expropriation without compensation, enforcement
of arbitral awards, international terrorism, and internationally recognized worker rights. Other practices taken
into account include market access for goods and services, investment practices and intellectual property rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An original and fourteen (14) copies of comments regarding Belarus' eligibility may be submitted, in English, to
the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee, 600 17th Street, NW., room 517, Washington, DC
20506. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on January 12, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 1, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

The Phlx is requesting Commission approval to extend the Exchange's Automated Options Market (``AUTOM'') system,
a pilot program, until December 31, 1994. AUTOM is an electronic delivery system of small options orders to the Phlx
trading floor, with an automatic execution feature.

The original proposal included a request for permanent approval of AUTOM. Because the Phlx is in the process of modifying
and upgrading the computer system on which the AUTOM system operates, the Phlx submitted a letter, dated December
17, 1993, withdrawing that request from the proposal (``Amendment No. 1''). The Phlx states that it will resubmit
its request for permanent approval after the Phlx and the Commission have had the opportunity to evaluate the operation
of the system in light of the current modifications and upgrades. See letter from J. Keith Kessel, Staff Counsel, Phlx,
to Richard L. Zack, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated December 17, 1993.

On March 31, 1988, the Commission approved the establishment of AUTOM as a pilot program.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange currently is proposing to extend the AUTOM pilot program until December 31, 1994. The Exchange represents
that, from the date of the last Commission order extending the AUTOM pilot program, AUTOM has operated efficiently
and without any material problems being reported by Phlx members or AUTOM users.

The Commission approved AUTOM on a pilot basis for market orders of up to five contracts for all exercise prices in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25540 (March 31, 1988), 53 FR 11390 (April 6, 1988). Since then, the order routing
feature of AUTOM has been expanded to include all orders in all exercise prices and months in all Phlx equity options.
In addition, day orders, good until cancelled orders, and cabinet orders (accommodation transactions) have become
eligible for delivery through the system, and the eligible order size for the order routing feature of AUTOM has been
increased from five to one hundred contracts. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28643 (November 26, 1990),
55 FR 49960 (December 3, 1990) at notes 2&hyph;6 for citations to Commission orders approving these expansions of

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AUTOM system is an online system that allows electronic delivery of options orders from member firms directly
to the appropriate specialist on the Phlx options trading floor, with electronic confirmation of order executions.
Specifically, once AUTOM orders are entered into the system and routed to the specialists' post, they are executed
manually by the specialist who, upon execution of the order, enters the relevant trade information into the system.
An execution report is then automatically transmitted to the firm that placed the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AUTOM system also has an automatic execution feature called ``Auto-X.'' Currently, Auto-X is available to public
customer market and marketable limit orders of up to 20 contracts. Orders eligible for automatic execution through
AUTOM are: (1) Printed in hard copy form at the floor representative booth of the delivering member organization;
(2) displayed on the trading crowd screen with buy/sell information omitted; and (3) printed in hard copy form at the
specialist post. The order is priced and executed automatically at the best displayed bid or offer, and the execution
is reported automatically to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). A report of the execution also is
electronically sent to the delivering member organization. Under Auto-X, the specialist is the contra-side of all
trades. However, the specialist is required to ensure participation of bids and offers on the limit order book and
in the trading crowd that are entitled to execution pursuant to the Phlx's rules of priority, parity, and precedence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx represents that, as a general matter, the AUTOM system has functioned well, servicing member firms options
orders. The Phlx states that two major groups of figures best reflect the performance of AUTOM: (1) The capacity figures;
and (2) the order flow figures.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 First, the Phlx believes that information regarding AUTOM's system capacity shows that AUTOM continues to have the
ability to service the volume of incoming orders. Specifically, the Phlx represented, in February 1993, that it would
make enhancements to systems capacity (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the ability of the system's hardware to properly route orders and service potential order volume) if order volume
during peak time exceeded 80% of CPU capacity. The Exchange represents that since making these representations with
respect to AUTOM's capacity, this 80% level has not been attained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
See letter from J. Keith Kessel, Staff Counsel, Phlx, to Monica C. Michelizzi, Staff Attorney, Division of Market
Regulation, Commission, dated November 19, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Phlx also believes that an analysis of current customer order flow demonstrates that the system capacity
is adequate to handle the current and potential number of orders transmitted through the system. Specifically, the
Phlx represents that only about two-thirds of all orders placed on AUTOM are executed because the other one-third
of the orders are too far away from the market to receive execution. The orders routed through AUTOM that receive execution
are either automatically executed through Auto-X or are manually executed by the receiving Phlx specialist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Phlx believes that AUTOM continues to facilitate smooth and liquid markets on the equity options
floor, and otherwise represents a favorable development for all concerned parties. The Phlx further believes that
AUTOM has performed well, servicing member firms' options orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Phlx, therefore, believes that it is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
for the Commission to permanently approve the AUTOM system. Specifically, the Phlx believes that the current proposal
is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade
and to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,
and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 6 and 11A.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission continues to believe that the development and implementation of the AUTOM system provides
for more efficient handling and reporting of orders in Phlx equity options through the use of new data processing and
communications techniques, thereby improving order processing and turnaround time. The Commission also believes
that the extension of the pilot program until December 31, 1994, will provide the Exchange with a better opportunity
to study its operation and effectiveness prior to permanent approval of the program.

The Commission notes that the Phlx is in the process of modifying and upgrading the computer system on which AUTOM operates.
Before granting permanent approval or any further extension of the pilot, the Commission expects the Phlx to submit
a full report, by November 1, 1994, describing the effect these modifications have had on the operation of AUTOM and
updating the information, submitted to the Commission on November 24, 1993, which set forth the benefits provided
by AUTOM, the degree of AUTOM usage, including the number and size of the orders routed through AUTOM and the number
and size of the orders automatically executed through the Auto-X system, and the system capacity of AUTOM and Auto-X
and any problems that have been encountered with the routing and execution features. The Commission also requests
that the Phlx submit its request for an extension of the pilot or permanent approval by November 1, 1994.

The Commission further notes that the Exchange has represented that from January 1, 1993 until present, AUTOM has
not suffered any operational failures and the Phlx has not received any formal complaints with respect to the system's
operation.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, since the pilot program is being extended without expansion of the scope of the pilot, the Commission does
not believe that the capacity of the Exchange's automated systems will be adversely effected by this extension.

The Commission recognizes that additional options classes added onto the system can have an effect on the systems
operations. In this context, the Commission expects that the Phlx will notify the Commission if the expansion of options
multiple trading, pursuant to Rule 19c&hyph;5 under the Act, has any material effect on the capacity of the Phlx's
automated systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to permit the Phlx to continue the AUTOM pilot program on an uninterrupted basis. Specifically, the Commission
believes that the Phlx's proposal to extend the AUTOM pilot program does not raise any new issues since it merely extends
the pilot program as it is currently operating. Further, the Commission believes that the pilot is beneficial in maintaining
the quality and efficiency of the Phlx's market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also notes that there have been no adverse comments concerning the pilot program since its implementation.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate
and consistent with Sections 6 and 11A of the Act.

TVA is cooperating with 22 other Federal and state agencies to investigate selected factors which may influence minority
and nonminority representation in state and Federal agency natural resource professions. A survey of natural resource
professions in the Southeastern United States will be conducted to determine (1) the diversity in the workforce and
job responsibilities, (2) factors that promote or preclude job satisfaction, (3) educational backgrounds attained
and needed by inservice professionals, and (4) conceptual framework for career selection by and retention of minorities
in natural resource professions. Results of the study may provide strategies for state and Federal agencies to refine
minority recruitment and retention programs, personnel planning, and career counseling.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (the Act) clarifies the criteria which determine when vessels are required
to be certificated by the Coast Guard for passenger carriage. To accomplish this, the Act, among other things, redefines
the terms ``passenger,'' ``passenger vessel,'' ``small passenger vessel,'' and ``uninspected passenger vessel.''
The Act also provides definitions for the terms ``passenger for hire'' and ``consideration.'' The Act establishes
an extension period for its applicability to charter vessels that will operate as charters with no crew provided.
The extension period is only available to those vessels whose owners make application to the Coast Guard by June 21,
1994. The Act further calls for the possible modification of existing requirements for certain charter vessels of
over 100 gross tons, and the establishment of new requirements for uninspected passenger vessels of at least 100 gross
tons carrying not more than 12 passengers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although most of the Act is effective immediately, it does not apply to passenger and small passenger vessels chartered
without a crew until six months after enactment. An additional 30 months extension of inapplicability is also available
for these vessels only. To receive this extension the vessel owner must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Make application for inspection with the local Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) by June
21, 1994; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Make the vessel available for examination by the Coast Guard prior to the carriage of passengers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Correct especially any hazardous conditions involving the vessel's structure, electrical system, and machinery
installation such as: (i) Grossly inadequate, missing, unsound, or severely deteriorated frames or major structural
members; (ii) wiring systems or electrical appliances without proper grounding or overcurrent protection; and
(iii) significant fuel or exhaust system leaks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Equip the vessel with lifesaving and firefighting equipment, or the portable equivalent, required for the route
and number of persons carried; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Verify through stability tests, calculations, or other practical means (which may include a history of safe operations)
that the vessel's stability is satisfactory for the size, route and number of passengers; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Develop a work plan approved by the Coast Guard to complete in a good faith effort all requirements necessary for
issuance of a Certificate of Inspection as soon as practicable. If a vessel qualifies for an extension, the Coast Guard
will issue a letter to the owner which establishes the conditions of operation for the vessel during the extension
period. The letter will specifically indicate the conditions of route, service, number of passengers, manning,
and equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending on the condition and outfitting of these vessels, the process to receive a Coast Guard extension letter
may take several weeks or months. Therefore, vessel owners desiring extensions are encouraged to apply early. Under
the Act, vessels chartered without a crew that carry more than 12 passengers, as defined by the Act, must have an extension
letter from the Coast Guard or have obtained a Certificate of Inspection to continue operations after June 21, 1994.

Possible Modified Regulations for Certain Existing Passenger Vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Act also permits the establishment of different structural fire protection, manning, operating and equipment
requirements for certain existing charter vessels if they are not necessary for safe operation. Such requirements
would apply to existing charter vessels carrying not more than 150 passengers on domestic voyages that are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons, and; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Former public vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than 500 gross tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified requirements will seek to ensure an equivalent degree of safety is achieved for those existing vessels
that cannot come into full compliance with the current passenger vessel regulations because of their construction.
To be eligible for these modified requirements, the owner of the vessel must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Make application for inspection with the local Coast Guard OCMI before June 21, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide satisfactory documentation that the vessel was chartered at least once within the period December 20,
1992 to December 20, 1993.

New Regulations for Uninspected Passenger Vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The new definition of the term ``uninspected passenger vessel'' will now include vessels of at least 100 gross tons,
that are: carrying not more than 12 passengers, including at least one passenger for hire; or, that is chartered with
the crew provided or specified by the owner or the owner's representative and is carrying not more than 12 passengers.
New regulations will be developed for these vessels within 24 months.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the Noise Compatibility Program submitted
by the county of San Joaquin, Stockton, California, under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise
Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On May 10, 1991, the FAA determined
that the Noise Exposure Maps submitted by under part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On November
22, 1993, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Noise Compatibility Program for Metropolitan
Oakland International Airport. Twenty-eight (28) of the proposed measures were approved, and two (2) measures were
disapproved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the Noise Compatibility Program for Stockton
Metropolitan Airport, effective November 22, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a Noise Exposure Map, may submit to the FAA a Noise Compatibility
Program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the Noise Exposure Maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each airport Noise Compatibility Program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The Noise Compatibility Program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport Noise Compatibility Program are delineated
in FAR part 150, &sect;150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Burlingame, California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The county of San Joaquin submitted to the FAA on February 28, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other
documentation produced during the Noise Compatibility Planning study conducted from May 1988, through October
1990. The Stockton Metropolitan Airport Noise Exposure Maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable
requirements on May 10, 1991. Notice of this determination was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 28, 1991.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Stockton Metropolitan Airport study contains a proposed Noise Compatibility Program comprised of actions designed
for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to,
or beyond, the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a Noise Compatibility
Program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on May 26, 1993 and was required
by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an
approval of such program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submitted program contained thirty (30) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA
completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR part 150 have
been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Airports
effective November 22, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outright approval was granted for twenty-eight (28) of the specific program elements. Two (2) elements were disapproved.
The approved elements included existing preferential runway usage, existing flight procedures, existing aircraft
category procedures, existing pattern procedures, practice circling maneuvers, education of airport users, amend
county development title, residential/nonresidential noise sensitive land use exclusion area, sound attenuation
in new construction, acoustical studies, real estate disclosure, residential soundproofing program, noise abatement
departures, informational signs, noise abatement advisories, noise abatement hotlines, interagency coordination
procedures, review committee, amend airport land use plan, and Weston Ranch easement area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Acting Assistant Administrator
for Airports on November 22, 1993. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents
comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices
of the Santa Clara County.

American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Denial of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) of Torrance, California determined that certain passenger cars failed to
comply with 49 CFR 571.208, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, ``Occupant Crash Protection,'' and filed
an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. Honda also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy
requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on May 21, 1993 (58 FR 29689). This notice denies that petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph S4.1.4.2 of Standard No. 208 requires that motor vehicles be equipped with seat belt assemblies that comply
with Standard No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies.'' Paragraph S4.3(j)(3) of Standard No. 209 requires that

An emergency locking retractor of a Type 1 or Type 2 seat belt assembly *&blank;*&blank;* shall not lock, if the retractor
is sensitive to vehicle acceleration, when the retractor is rotated in any direction to any angle of 15 degrees or less
from its orientation in the vehicle *&blank;*&blank;*

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Honda determined that the seat belt assemblies for the rear outside seating positions of approximately 1.2 million
model year 1990, 1991, 1992, and early 1993 two-door and four-door Accords do not comply with S4.3(j)(3), the emergency
locking retractor requirements of Standard No. 209. When the vehicle in which the noncomplying belt is installed
is in certain parking positions such as on a steep uphill grade, the rear seat occupants are sometimes unable to pull
the belt out of the retractor, and thus cannot fasten their belts. The vehicle must be moved to a more level position
for the rear seat occupant to be able to put on the seat belt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following arguments:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the petitioner's opinion, the noncompliance does not affect the occupant protection performance of the subject
seat belt assemblies. To verify this, Honda tested the belts to determine whether they meet the locking requirements
of Standard No. 209. All the belts complied with these requirements. Further, Honda performed dynamic sled test comparisons
of the noncompliant belts to complaint belts at a test speed of 30 miles per hour. Honda found that the performance of
the noncompliant belts was almost the same as that of the compliant belts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that the primary effect of the noncompliant seat belts is inconvenience due to the rear seat occupant's
inability to pull the belt out from the retractor under certain parking conditions, as when the vehicle is in a significant
uphill parking position in excess of 11 degrees, or when the vehicle has been parked such that one side of the vehicle
is substantially higher than the other (at least nine degrees). Honda argued that the opportunities for parking an
affected vehicle in this type of situation are very uncommon and would present a high level of discomfort to rear seat
occupants from sitting at this angle. Honda has found that when the vehicle is parked on ground at lesser angles than
previously noted, the noncompliant belts work completely normally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda reviewed its consumer records for complaints relating to the noncompliance. It found that consumers had registered
a total of 173 complaints regarding the 4-door sedan and 34 complaints regarding the 2-door coupe. These complaints
are known to be related to the subject noncompliance, as the problem is clearly described in the complaint. In addition,
Honda received 168 complaints regarding the 4-door sedan and 46 complaints regarding the 2-door coupe which were
not clearly defined and may not be related to the subject noncompliance. The consumer complaint ratios, taking into
account only the known related complaints, are 0.026 percent for the 4-door sedan and 0.014 percent for the 2-door
coupe.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since Honda offers a lifetime warranty for seat belts, it will replace, free of charge, any unit that has a functional
problem at any time during the life of the vehicle. In this instance, Honda will notify owners of the subject vehicles
that it will replace the sensor in the noncompliant seat belt retractors if the customer experiences the locking problem.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda concluded by stating that, although the noncomplying retractors may, in certain situations, result in the
belt not being able to be pulled out of the retractor, this is a temporary condition which is remedied if the vehicle
is moved from an uphill position of greater than 11 degrees or a lateral angle of greater than nine degrees. There is
no risk to safety once the belt has been successfully fastened, since the performance of the belts is equal to those
which are in total compliance with Standard No. 209. Because the seat belts have a lifetime warranty, any complaint
concerning the ability to activate the belts will result in Honda replacing the belt with no cost to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received on the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Occupant protection has been a primary safety goal of the agency since its inception. Therefore, noncompliances
with occupant protection requirements are treated with particular concern. The noncompliance described in the
petition is one that occurs only under specific circumstances of vehicle attitude. That these circumstances are
not isolated and occur with a degree of frequency is borne out by the number of complaints that Honda has received. Generally,
a petitioner for a determination of inconsequentiality supports its arguments with the statement that no complaints
have been received. In this instance, there have been sufficiently numerous expressions of concern to cause Honda
to formulate a ``Product Improvement Campaign''. Honda has submitted to NHTSA a draft of its proposed letter to owners.
The letter does not address the safety issue to NHTSA's satisfaction. The agency is concerned that the average recipient
will not understand the safety-relatedness of the problem described in the letter. As a result, the recipient would
be less likely to respond to it than to a letter meeting the requirements of Part 577.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has concluded that the noncompliance is one that will have the immediate effect of creating frustration when
the rear seat passenger is unable to pull the belt out of its retractor. This can deter the passenger from further efforts
to wear the belt until the vehicle is once more at an attitude at which the belt may be fastened, or even create the impression
that the belt is broken and that further attempts to dislodge it will be useless. Another possibility is that a parent
may be unable initially to secure a child safety seat, then neglect to get out of the car to secure it when the vehicle
is moved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the parent may respond by moving the child seat from the rear seat position to the front. This would
be contrary to the agency's policy of encouraging parents to install child safety seats in the rear in view of the greater
safety of that location. In NHTSA's view, any noncompliance that has the potential to decrease the chances of use of
a seat belt is not one that is inconsequential. Therefore, both the notification letter and the remedy must be in accordance
with Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that the petitioner has not met its burden of persuasion that
the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is
denied.

 This document publishes the final data on passenger motor vehicle thefts that occurred in calendar years 1990&hyph;1991.
As provided in the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, these data were used to determine the theft rates for existing passenger
motor vehicle lines manufactured in model years 1990 and 1991 and to determine the median theft rate for all those lines.
Vehicle lines with theft rates exceeding the median theft rate of 3.5866 per thousand vehicles produced, are subject
to selection for coverage under the Theft Prevention Standard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Theft Act), added title VI to the Motor Vehicle Information and
Cost Savings Act (Cost Savings Act). Pursuant to title VI, NHTSA promulgated 49 CFR part 541, Federal Motor Vehicle
Theft Prevention Standard. Part 541 establishes performance requirements for inscribing or affixing vehicle identification
numbers (VINs) onto certain major original equipment and replacement parts of high theft lines of passenger motor
vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 603 of the Cost Savings Act, as originally enacted, specified three categories of car lines that were high
theft lines within the meaning of title VI. These three types were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing lines that had a theft rate exceeding the median theft rate for calendar years (CYs) 1983&hyph;1984 (section
603(a)(1)(A));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New lines that were likely to have a theft rate exceeding that median theft rate (section 603(a)(1)(B)); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lines with theft rates below the median theft rate, but which had a majority of major parts interchangeable with lines
whose theft rate exceeded or was likely to exceed the median theft rate (section 603(a)(1)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 603(b) of the Cost Savings Act provided that the median theft rate was the combined rate determined for CYs
1983&hyph;1984. Section 603(b) also set forth the equation NHTSA must use to determine the theft rates for each of
the vehicle lines. After applying this equation to each existing line, NHTSA was directed by section 603(b) to rank
the lines by theft rates to calculate the median theft rate.

 document of November 12, 1985 (50 FR 46666), NHTSA published the final theft data reflecting passenger motor vehicle
thefts in CYs 1983&hyph;1984. In that document, NHTSA also explained how it decided on the data source to be used and
how it calculated the final theft rates. Based on its calculations, NHTSA determined that the median theft rate for
CYs 1983 and 1984 was 3.2712 thefts per thousand vehicles.

1. The Anti Car Theft Act of 1992
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (ACTA), which became law on October 25, 1992, amended title VI, Theft Prevention, of the
Cost Savings Act. Title VI was amended to require the agency to calculate theft rates for passenger motor vehicle lines
for the CY 1990&hyph;1991 period and then to establish a new median theft rate, based on that same period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title VI was also amended to redefine ``passenger motor vehicle'' to include ``any multipurpose passenger vehicle
and light-duty truck that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less.'' See Section 601(1) of title VI. Before
title VI was amended, ``passenger motor vehicle'' was defined for title VI purposes to include passenger cars only.
Given the new definition of ``passenger motor vehicle,'' NHTSA must calculate the CY 1990 and 1991 theft rates not
only for passenger cars, but also for multipurpose passenger vehicle (MPV) and light-duty truck (LDT) lines that
are rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less. Depending on their theft rates, certain MPV and LDT lines
may be determined to be likely high theft lines, and thus may be subject to the parts marking requirements of the Theft
Prevention Standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On August 5, 1993, NHTSA published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 41834), for review and comment, a document setting forth data on passenger motor vehicle thefts that occurred
in CYs 1990&hyph;91, including preliminary theft rates of vehicle lines and the preliminary median theft rate for
all lines. In calculating the preliminary CY 1990&hyph;1991 theft rates, NHTSA followed the same procedures it used
in calculating the 1983&hyph;1984 theft rates, with minor exceptions. The calculation procedure, based on National
Crime Information Center data and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of each stolen vehicle, was described
in the August 1993 document.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Out of a total of 226 vehicle lines, NHTSA preliminarily determined that the median theft rate for CYs 1990&hyph;1991
was 3.6436 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. Of those vehicle lines with a theft rate higher than 3.6436, 90 were
passenger car lines, 17 were MPV lines, and 6 were LDT lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Table I of the August 1993 document, NHTSA tentatively ranked each of the 226 vehicle lines in descending order of
theft rate. Public comment was sought on the accuracy of the data, especially production volumes of individual vehicle
lines. Public comment was also sought on the methodology used by NHTSA in determining the ranking of the existing passenger
motor vehicle lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the preliminary data, NHTSA also published a Table III that listed the previously designated high theft lines
with theft rates that fell below the preliminary median theft rate of 3.6436. The agency noted that lines that are presently
listed in appendix A of 49 CFR part 541 as subject to the requirements of the Theft Prevention Standard will continue
to be so listed regardless of whether they fall below the median theft rate. This is because section 603(d) of the Cost
Savings Act provides that, except for exemptions from parts marking due to NHTSA-approved antitheft devices, the
agency may not ``render the standard inapplicable to any line which at any time has been subject to the standard.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA explained that in selecting high theft lines based on the 1990/91 median theft rate, it will follow the procedures
it established in 49 CFR part 542, Procedures for Selecting Lines to be Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard. The
agency indicated that it contemplated that newly designated high theft passenger cars would be required to begin
to comply with parts marking requirements in MY 1995, but that compliance for high theft MPV's and LDTs might be delayed
to a later model year since determination of ``major parts'' for these vehicles has not yet been made.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document, NHTSA received nine written comments, all from vehicle manufacturers. The commenters addressed four
subjects: NHTSA's methodology in calculating the 1990/91 theft rates, the specific preliminary theft data regarding
the respective commenter's vehicles, the agency's intention to require that newly designated high theft care lines
be marked beginning in model year 1995, and the effect of the 1990/91 theft rates on lines previously determined high
theft.

1. NHTSA's Methodology in Calculating Rates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA received on comment on its methodology in calculating the new theft rates. Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen)
stated its belief that ACTA sought to alleviate chop-shop related vehicle thefts. It therefore recommended that
only thefts relating to chop-shop activities be counted in determining theft rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While chop-shop-related thefts may have been Congress' primary concern in enacting the Theft Act, the relevant language
in that Act (which remained unaltered in the ACTA) directs NHTSA to calculate the theft rate of a passenger motor vehicle
line using a fraction with `` the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line *&blank;*&blank;*'',
as the numerator. (See section 603(b)(1).) The statute does not direct the agency to make theft motive distinctions
such as those suggested by Volkswagen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, NHTSA does not believe it appropriate to only use chop-shop related theft data in calculating theft rates
for a particular line, or the median theft rates for a particular line, or the median theft rate of all lines. The final
data published in this document calculates theft rates for each particular line, using all reported new passenger
motor vehicle thefts for that line, in CY 1990 and 1991.

NHTSA received comments from the following seven manufacturers concerning the listing of certain vehicle lines
and preliminary data presented in the August 1993 document: Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler), Fiat Auto R&amp;D
U.S.A. (Fiat), Ford Motor Company (Ford), Mazda (North America), Inc., Nissan Research and Development, Inc. (Nissan),

Chrylsler requested that the Chrysler LeBaron line be separated into three lines, to differentiate among the LeBaron
Landau 4-door sedan, the LeBaron 2-door coupe and the LeBaron convertible. NHTSA agrees that the LeBaron line should
be separated, but only into two lines. Since the 2-door coupe and the convertible are built on the same platform, the
agency considers the vehicles to be in the same line, the LeBaron Coupe/Convertible. The LeBaron 4-door sedan is in
a separate line, the LeBaron Sedan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chrysler also stated that the Chrysler New Yorker is more accurately listed as the ``New Yorker 5th Avenue/Imperial.''
Listing the 1990/91 New Yorker line as the New Yorker 5th Avenue/Imperial makes that line distinct from the LH series
New Yorker, that Chrysler introduced in model year 1994. NHTSA concurs with this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford commented that only 16 percent of its model year 1990 and 1991 E150 light duty truck line had a gross vehicle weight
rating (GVWR) of 6,000 lbs. or less, and that model year 1996, each vehicle in its E150 line will be over 6,000 lbs. GVWR.
Thus, by model year 1996, that company's E150 light duty trucks will not meet the ACTA's definition of ``passenger
motor vehicle,'' since they will have a GVWR exceeding 6,000 pounds. Ford stated that it assumes that the effective
date of the parts marking standard for MPV's and LDT's will be no earlier than the 1996 model year and that, therefore,
it has concluded that no E150 vans will be subject to parts making. As discussed below, NHTSA has decided that manufacturers
of liens designated as high theft pursuant to the 1990/91 median theft rate must begin marking their vehicles in model
year 1996. The agency agrees that if the Ford E150 line does not fall within the statutory definition of ``passenger
motor vehicle,'' the vehicles are not subject to the theft prevention standard.

 document. As discussed above, Table III listed the previously designated high theft lines with theft rates that fell
below the preliminary median theft rate. The Mazda 323/Protege line was erroneously listed as a high theft line, and
the Mazda 929 was not listed. NHTSA has corrected the table for this document by removing the 323/Protege and including
the 929.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen noted that Table III listed the ``Quattro,'' which that company assumed refers to the Audi V8 Quattro Sedan.
Since the line was determined by NHTSA to be likely low theft, Volkswagen asked that the line be removed from Table III.
NHTSA concurs that listing the ``Quattro'' in Table III was an error, and has removed it from the final data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also identified several typographical errors in the theft data presented in the August 1993 document.
In light of those comments, the agency has corrected the theft rate for the Ford Tempo and Nissan NX Coupe, and the 1990
production number for the Suzuki Sidekick. NHTSA has also corrected production data for the Jetta line for model year
1991, based on Volkswagen's comment. Based on comments from Rolls-Royce, NHTSA added three Rolls-Royce lines. Two
Maserati lines were also added. No thefts were reported for any of the Rolls-Royce or Maserati lines in 1990 or 1991.

Suzuki provided model year 1990 production numbers for the Chevrolet Sprint, Firefly and GEO Metro (including production
numbers for both the hardtop and convertible models) lines. The Sprint is sold in Puerto Rico as the Firefly. General
Motors (GM) has already provided NHTSA with production figures for the Chevrolet Sprint (including the Firefly).
Since GM certifies compliance with the theft prevention standard for the Sprint line, NHTSA will base the final theft
rates for these lines using GM's production numbers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM also certifies theft standard compliance for the GEO Metro. GM's data, however, did not include production numbers
for the convertible GEO Metros. Therefore, the final theft rates for the GEO Metro reflect the additional information
provided by Suzuki.

In addition to the above changes, NHTSA is making the following corrections to the list of high theft lines with theft
rates below the median theft rate. Two lines that were inadvertently omitted, the Saturn SC and Lotus Elan, are added.
One line that was inadvertently included, the Mercedes-Benz 129 line, is removed.

Fiat noted that the production figures shown in the agency's August 1993 document correspond to the figures in the
1990 and 1991 model year CAFE reports, and expressed the belief that NHTSA's theft regulation requires theft marking
subjection to be based on actual calendar year production. As indicated above, the equation that NHTSA must use in
determining the theft rates for each vehicle line is set forth in section 603(b) of the Coast Savings Act. That section
provides that the agency is to use ``the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of
[a] line (as reported to the Environmental Protection Agency under title V of this Act) which are of [two specified]

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

figures suggested by Fiat.

Four commenters discussed whether, for the new vehicle lines determined to be high theft based on the CY 1990&hyph;1991
theft data, parts marking should begin in MY 1995. Each of the four commenters, Honda, Nissan, Toyata, and Volkswagen,
asked that the required marking begin with MY 1996. Essentially, each manufacturer stated it needed more leadtime
to be able to comply, and it would be a hardship to begin marking in MY 1995. Some commenters cited start up difficulties
since they would be parts marking for the first time. Volkswagen noted that for some manufacturers, requiring parts
marking in model year 1995 may not provide enough leadtime for the manufacturers to be able to submit timely petitions
for exemption from parts marking, pursuant to part 543, Exemption from Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard.

Based on these comments, NHTSA has decided that requiring parts marking in MY 1995 for the new vehicle lines determined
to be high theft based on the CY 1990&hyph;1991 theft data would impose an undue burden on manufacturers. The agency
also agrees with Volkswagen that requiring newly designated high theft lines to be marked beginning with model year
1995 may not permit some manufacturers to submit timely petitions for exemption from parts marking for its vehicle
lines, pursuant to part 543. Section 543.5(b)(4) requires a manufacturer to submit a petition ``at least 8 months
before the commencement of production of the line(s).'' For a manufacturer which plans to introduce its model year
1995 lines in the summer of 1994, Part 543 petitions may already be due at NHTSA. Delaying parts marking to model year
1996 would permit all manufacturers to submit timely petitions for exemption from parts marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, NHTSA plans to apply the parts marking requirement for newly designated high theft lines, including
cars and MPV's/LDT's, pursuant to the 1990/91 median theft rates, beginning with model year 1996. This expectation
will be reflected in a future rulemaking to amend the Theft Prevention Standard.

Nissan made several observations regarding the effect of the 1990/91 median theft rate on Nissan vehicle lines previously
determined to be high theft. NHTSA confirms Nissan's understanding that the Infiniti Q45, although ranked no. 177
in the final theft rates, continues to be a high theft line subject to the theft prevention standard. Section 603(a)(5)
of the ACTA provides that any line subject to parts marking when the original Motor Vehicle Theft Act was enacted continues
to be so subject, and that the only exemptions are for vehicles with NHTSA-approved antitheft devices. See also section
603(d). In model year 1990, the Infiniti Q45 was granted an exemption from parts marking, based on a standard antitheft
device on all vehicles in the line. (See 53 FR 45181; November 8, 1988.) Thus, Nissan may continue to place the antitheft
device on all vehicles in the Q45 line, in lieu of parts marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also confirms that the publication of this final theft data has no effect on the Nissan Infiniti J30, which was
not yet introduced in 1990 or 1991. The Infiniti J30, a high theft line introduced in model year 1993, was also granted
an exemption from parts marking, beginning with model year 1993. (See 56 FR 47983; September 23, 1991.)

Final Theft Data and Final Median Rate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Table I of this document, the agency lists each of the 231 vehicle lines manufactured in model years 1990 and 1991
in descending order according to theft rate. Based on the data set forth in Table I, NHTSA has determined the final median
theft rate for 1990 and 1991 to be 3.5866 thefts per 1000 vehicles produced. The final median is the theft rate ranked
116th (3.5866 thefts per thousand) in the table, according to the instructions in section 603(b)(2) of the Cost Savings
Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If NHTSA has not previously determined the line to be high theft, each line shown in positions 1 through 115, inclusive,
in Table I, will be subject to selection as a high theft line. In selecting high theft lines based on the 1990/91 median
theft rate, NHTSA will follow the procedures it established in 49 CFR part 542 Procedures for Selecting Lines to be
Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard, and provide affected manufacturers an opportunity to comment on NHTSA's
preliminary determination that a line is high theft. Final selection by NHTSA will mean that the vehicles in these
lines and their major replacement parts will have to be marked as specified in 49 CFR part 541, the vehicle theft prevention
standard, beginning with model year 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Table II of this document lists previously designated high theft lines with theft rates below the median
theft rate of 3.5866, and Table III lists lines that have theft rates above the median theft rate and have major parts
interchangeable with those of lines that have theft rates below the median theft rate.
