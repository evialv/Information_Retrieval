SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directive (AD) that applies to Rockwell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International/Air Transport Division (Collins) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DME&hyph;700 distance measuring equipment (DME) installed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft. This action requires modifying these DME 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units to ensure they are functioning properly. Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports of the affected DME units failing to process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and update distance outputs, and reports of these units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing a continuous restart mode upon power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application prompted this AD. The actions specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD are intended to prevent improper operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this equipment, which could result in navigational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
errors.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that applies to certain Collins DME&hyph;700 distance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement equipment installed on aircraft was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 25, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 5949). The action proposed to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifying these DME units to ensure that they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning properly. The proposed modifications would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accomplished in accordance with the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collins service bulletins (SB) (1) SB 20, Revision 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;20, dated August 30, 1991, which when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated prevents a condition known as ``sleeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DME's''; and (2) Collins SB 24, DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;24, dated May 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15, 1992; Collins SB 25, DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;25, dated November 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11, 1992; and Collins SB 26, DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;26, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 21, 1992, as applicable, which when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated prevent a condition known as ``deaf DME's''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment. Based on the comments received, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal was changed to add a modification that went 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the scope of that which was originally proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the FAA issued a supplementary NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that incorporated minor revisions and added the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional modification. The proposed actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the Supplemental NPRM would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in accordance with the following, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons were again afforded an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to comment on the proposed action. Due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration has been given to the five comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters concur with the proposed rule as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (Collins) states that there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two errors in the part numbers referenced in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD: (1) part number (P/N) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
622&hyph;4540&hyph;022 was referenced as P/N 622&hyph;4540&hyph;22 in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicability section of the AD; and (2) in the chart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (c) of the proposed AD, the sentence that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consists of the following words: ``All applicable DME&hyph;700 Units, Converts &hyph;022, &hyph;021, or &hyph;022
to &hyph;023.'' should be changed to ``All applicable DME&hyph;700 Units, Converts &hyph;020, &hyph;021, or &hyph;022
to &hyph;023.'' The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs and has changed the proposed AD accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter reports that the Airbus Model A330 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane is not yet certificated, and should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the list of affected airplane models. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA concurs that this airplane is not certificated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has deleted it from the list of possible affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes. However, the Applicability section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD is worded as ``DME equipment that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed on, but not limited to, the following model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category:''. If this airplane would become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificated for operation with the Collins DME&hyph;700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, then this action would apply to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter states that these DME units were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
never certificated on Boeing Model B757 airplanes, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should therefore be removed from the applicability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed AD. The FAA concurs and has revised the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter suggests several minor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
editorial revisions and corrections to increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding of the proposed AD. The FAA concurs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these changes would improve clarity and has revised the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the comments noted above, the FAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that air safety and the public interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the changes referenced above and minor editorial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrections. The FAA has determined that these changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nor add any additional burden upon the public than was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The condition specified by the required action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not caused by actual hours time-in-service (TIS) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane that the equipment is installed in. There is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no correlation between improper operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and the age or number of times the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is utilized. Based on this, the compliance time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 518 DME&hyph;700 units installed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD, that it will take approximately 7 workhours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per unit to accomplish the required action, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the owner/operator. Based on these figures, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be $199,430. This cost figure is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assumption that none of the affected airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners/operators have accomplished the required action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant economic impact, positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1972, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firearms (ATF) was established by Treasury Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order No. 120&hyph;01 (formerly Order No. 221). This Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly-formed Bureau the functions, powers and duties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laws. The Order specifically stated that ``all existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities relating to the collection, processing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depositing, or accounting for taxes *&blank;*&blank;* shall continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be performed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent not now performed by the Alcohol, Tobacco and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firearms Division *&blank;*&blank;* until the Director shall otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide with the approval of the Secretary.'' ATF assumed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for the collection of taxes imposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code in July 1987, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of Treasury Decision (T.D.) ATF&hyph;251, and adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in 27 CFR part 70 similar to those found in 26 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR part 301 which concerned the deposit and assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxes. The remaining collection functions with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxes administered by ATF were transferred by way of T.D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;301, at which time ATF adopted regulations similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those used by IRS relating to the examination, assessment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and collection functions. These provisions are also found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 27 CFR part 70. Under existing regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional directors (compliance) are authorized to accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks and waive penalties associated with the collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of taxes administered by ATF. This final rule amends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 CFR part 70 by vesting the authority to accept checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and waive penalties with the Chief, Tax Processing Center, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in addition to the regional directors (compliance), in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to ease the burden on the regional directors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(compliance), simplify the waiver process for taxpayers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and permit the more efficient functioning of ATF's tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also removes the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations dealing with tax collection activities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been determined to fall outside of ATF's authority: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 CFR 70.166(a), 70.201, 70.211, 70.212 and 70.487.

Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule because no requirement to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to a final regulatory flexibility analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the agency was not required to publish a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other law. A copy of this final rule was submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 7805(f). No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments were received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action, because (1) it will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment, public health or safety, or State, local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this final rule is a rule of agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management that merely transfers the authority relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the acceptance of checks and waiver of penalties, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision with notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and public procedure thereon under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(B) or subject to the effective date limitation in 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its Schedule for Rating Disabilities of the Genitourinary System.
This amendment is based on a General Accounting Office (GAO) study noting that there has been no comprehensive review
of the rating schedule since 1945, and recommending that such a review be conducted. The effect of this action is to
update the genitourinary portion of the rating schedule to ensure that it uses current medical terminology, unambiguous
criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In December 1988, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recommended that VA prepare a plan for a comprehensive review
of the rating schedule and, based on the results, revise the medical criteria accordingly. As part of the process to
implement these recommendations, VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 4.115 and 4.115a in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 2, 1991 (56 FR 61216&hyph;20). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions
or objections on or before January 2, 1992. We received comments from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American
Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and VA employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have made a number of editorial changes, primarily of syntax and punctuation, throughout the final rule. These
changes are intended to clarify the rating criteria and represent no substantive amendment. Generic terms such as
``severe,'' ``moderate,'' and ``mild,'' which preceded various evaluation criteria in the proposed regulations,
have been removed. Rather than helping to explain or clarify the specific evaluation criteria which they precede,
these terms inject an element of ambiguity not otherwise present. Under diagnostic code 7524, we have deleted the
phrase ``other than undescended or congenitally undeveloped'' for the noncompensable evaluation criteria since
the NOTE following adequately explains that an undescended or congenitally undeveloped testis is not ratable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that &sect;4.115 be amended to allow separate evaluation of coexisting ``heart disease'' in the event
of an absent kidney, or when chronic renal disease has progressed to the point where regular dialysis is required.
One commenter pointed out that in addition to heart disease, hypertension is often manifested in cases of renal disease,
but that the proposed regulatory language would preclude a separate evaluation for hypertension. He suggested that
we substitute the term ``cardiovascular disease'' for ``heart disease.'' Although we agree that this provision
should apply to hypertension as well as heart disease, we believe that the term ``cardiovascular'' is too broad since
it might be interpreted to include cardiovascular conditions unrelated to renal dysfunction. We have therefore
amended &sect;4.115 to specify that coexisting heart disease or hypertension may be separately evaluated in the
absence of one kidney or when the claimant requires dialysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our proposed rating formula for renal dysfunction under &sect;4.115a included a requirement at the 100 percent level
for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine thresholds of more than 100mg% and 10mg%, respectively. One commenter
felt that the proposed requirements are too high and suggested that 80mg% and 8mg% would be more appropriate. Upon
further review, we have concluded that measurements over 80/8mg% suggest a need for dialysis and would therefore
be a more appropriate threshold. We have accordingly amended the criteria for a 100 percent evaluation in &sect;4.115a.
In keeping with that change, we have also amended the ranges of BUN and creatinine readings required for an 80 percent
evaluation to 40&hyph;80mg% and 4&hyph;8mg%, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters felt that the word ``invalidism'' in the proposed criteria for the 100 and 80 percent levels for renal
dysfunction is inappropriate because it is archaic, too subjective, and in fact suggests a level of severity more
consistent with entitlement to special monthly compensation. VA agrees, and has substituted the phrase ``precluding
more than sedentary activity'' for the 100 percent evaluation, and the phrase ``generalized poor health characterized
by *&blank;*&blank;*'' for the 80 percent evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the 60 percent evaluation level for renal dysfunction, we had proposed that qualifying manifestations of hypertension
be referred to as ``moderate hypertension'' whereas under the 30 percent level we had proposed that hypertension
be ``minimally compensable under diagnostic code 7101.'' One commenter recommended that hypertension be described
consistently in terms of diagnostic code 7101 throughout the criteria for renal dysfunction. We agree. Such a change
would promote not only a clearer understanding of the rule, but internal consistency within the rating schedule as
well. We have therefore modified the criteria for a 60 percent evaluation to require hypertension at least 40 percent
disabling under diagnostic code 7101, for a 30 percent evaluation to require hypertension at least 10 percent disabling
under diagnostic code 7101, and the zero percent evaluation to include hypertension non-compensable under diagnostic
code 7101. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that either albumin and casts with a history of acute nephritis or renal dysfunction with mild hypertension
warrants a 10 percent evaluation rather than the zero percent we had proposed under the criteria for renal dysfunction.
We do not concur. Albuminuria and granular casts are clinical findings which may or may not indicate active kidney
disease, but which themselves are not inherently disabling. Since the level of compensation is determined primarily
by the extent to which a condition is disabling, and since an asymptomatic condition, or combination of asymptomatic
conditions, imposing no discernible industrial impairment does not warrant a compensable evaluation, we find no
reason to assign these conditions a compensable evaluation in the absence of chronic kidney disease or hypertension
which is compensable under diagnostic code 7101. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters questioned the reduction of the evaluation for loss of a single kidney from 30 percent to zero percent
disabling. Although long-term renal function returns to near normal due to hypertrophy of the remaining kidney,
the significant anatomical alteration caused by removal of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kidney, the resulting surgical scar, and the precautions which must be taken to protect the remaining kidney, could
reasonably be expected to prevent a veteran from engaging in certain, but by no means all, occupations. Upon further
reconsideration, we have therefore elected to retain the minimum 30 percent evaluation for loss of a single kidney
under diagnostic code 7500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the proposed criteria for rating voiding dysfunction under &sect;4.115a would be inadequate
for evaluating veterans with neurogenic bladders who use either indwelling or intermittent catheterization to
void, and suggested a separate diagnostic code for neurogenic bladder. Although a need for separate rating criteria
was implied, the commenter offered no alternative criteria for our consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA agrees that it would be useful to have a separate diagnostic code for this disability, which is common in cases of
severe spinal cord injury. We have therefore added diagnostic code 7542 for neurogenic bladder with instructions
to rate the condition under the criteria for voiding dysfunction, which we believe are adequate to evaluate neurogenic
bladder. Neurogenic bladder is manifested as urine leakage or frequent urination, both of which correspond to categories
of voiding dysfunction as proposed. In addition, the word ``appliance'' as used in the criteria for incontinence
clearly includes all types of catheters as well as any other assistive device for urination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the general rating criteria for urinary frequency in &sect;4.115a, we had proposed separate sets of evaluation
criteria for daytime and nighttime frequency. The criteria for daytime frequency were assigned evaluations of 40,
20, and 10 percent. For nighttime frequency, awakening to void five or more times per night was proposed as 20 percent,
awakening to void three to four times was assigned 10 percent, and one to two times was non-compensable. One commenter
felt that the evaluations for nighttime frequency should be higher than proposed, while another believed that the
distinction between daytime and nighttime frequency is artificial and should be eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Separate criteria for nighttime frequency were proposed since a patient may be more likely to report this symptom
to an examining physician, especially in the early stages of renal disease. Upon further review, however, VA agrees
that nighttime frequency is just as indicative of significant disease as daytime frequency, and that different evaluation
levels are not warranted. We have therefore incorporated the three levels originally proposed for nighttime frequency
with the 40, 20, and 10 percent levels under daytime frequency. Instances in which a person is awakened to void only
once a night, however, have not been made compensable, since this degree of frequency does not, in our judgment, impose
a disability significant enough to warrant the payment of compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the frequency of the need to change absorbent materials under the criteria for rating voiding
dysfunction is not a useful measure of incontinence because: (1) The changing of absorbent materials does not accurately
quantify the degree of disability, (2) the wearing of absorbent materials may be inappropriate for paraplegics,
and (3) there is no objective method to determine the frequency of the need to change absorbent materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not concur. A person who needs to change absorbent materials often has a greater loss of voluntary control than
one who needs changes less frequently. The frequency of changes can be objectively reported either by the veteran
or the person providing care, with the frequency of the need for such changes determined by an examining physician.
These criteria represent, in our judgment, a satisfactory means to measure urinary incontinence and, since no reasonable
alternative has been suggested, we have elected to retain them. For some persons, wearing absorbent materials may
be inappropriate; such people require the use of a catheter or some other means to compensate for the loss of control.
As previously discussed, the criteria at the 60 percent level addressing the use of such an appliance are adequate
to evaluate the disabilities of those for whom the use of absorbent materials is inappropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the words ``increased to the next higher'' were unclear in the instruction for arteriolar
nephrosclerosis following diagnostic code 7507. We agree that this language, which was retained from the prior rating
schedule, is ambiguous. The intended effect is to recognize that heart disease or hypertension is more serious when
the claimant also has renal disabilities. We have amended the instruction following diagnostic code 7507 to clarify
this principle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the diagnostic codes for nephrolithiasis (7508), ureterolithiasis (7510), and stricture of the ureter (7511),
a 30 percent evaluation was proposed for recurrent stone formation requiring diet therapy, drug therapy, or frequent
surgical therapy. One commenter believed a higher evaluation should be assigned for ``frequent surgical therapy,''
since frequent surgery implies a condition more severe than one controlled through diet or drug therapy. By ``surgical
therapy'' we meant to include extraction through a catheter or fragmentation through such means as extracorporeal
shock wave lithotripsy. To remove any ambiguity and thus avoid confusion, we have amended the criteria under diagnostic
codes 7508, 7510, and 7511 to refer to ``invasive or non-invasive procedures'' rather than ``surgical therapy,''
and we have replaced the term ``frequent'' with the more objective measurement of more than twice per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the words ``multiple urethroperineal'' in the evaluation criteria for fistula of the urethra
(7519) were unclear. Once again, we agree that a term retained from the prior rating schedule is vague and potentially
confusing. We have added the word ``fistulae'' to indicate that when there are two or more fistulous tracts draining
from the perineum a 100 percent evaluation will be assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under diagnostic code 7531 (kidney transplants), we originally proposed that a follow-up examination be conducted
six months after surgery in the same manner as for malignancies (diagnostic code 7528). Diagnostic code 7531 previously
required assignment of a 100 percent evaluation with a prospective reduction two years after surgery. Three commenters
stated that a period longer than six months is warranted because of the fragile condition of these patients, the complications
of surgery, the side-effects of immunosuppressive therapy, and the risk of transplant rejection. One commenter
suggested that a one year period would be reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the possibility of late immunologic, medical, and surgical complications, we believe it is more reasonable
to assess residual disability one year after surgery instead of six months. We have therefore amended the NOTE following
diagnostic code 7531 to state that a mandatory VA examination will be conducted one year after hospital discharge
instead of the six months originally proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A minimum rating of 30 percent was proposed under the diagnostic code for kidney transplant for as long as a patient
is on immunosuppressive medication. One commenter stated that almost all persons who have undergone transplant
surgery permanently require immunosuppressive medication. Upon further review, VA agrees that it is so seldom that
immunosuppressive therapy can be stopped after transplantation, that the proposed exception to the minimum evaluation
under diagnostic code 7531 is not necessary. We have deleted that exception from the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believed that there should be an evaluation level of 30 percent in addition to the 20 percent level proposed
under diagnostic code 7532, Renal tubular dysfunctions, since various renal tubular nephropathies may have severe
disabling effects. Another commenter suggested that the category of renal tubular dysfunctions was too vague and
seemed to embrace a variety of conditions which should be singly listed, and that they often render veterans unemployable
due to the combination of treatment and symptoms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Renal tubular disorders include disorders of the proximal nephron function, disorders of function of the ascending
limb of the loop of Henle, and disorders of distal nephron function. We have amended the parenthetical portion of the
heading of diagnostic code 7532 to include additional examples of these diseases, which have common characteristics
and should therefore be rated under the same criteria to ensure consistency. These conditions generally cause metabolic
imbalances which can be adequately treated by replacement therapy; as such, in our judgment, they do not warrant an
evaluation greater than 20 percent. They may on occasion, however, result in more severe kidney dysfunction. For
that reason we have added an instruction to alternatively rate this disability as renal dysfunction, which will allow
evaluations greater than 20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that in keeping with ``current BVA [Board of Veterans Appeals] policy,'' the diagnostic code
for penile deformity with loss of erectile power (7522) should provide a 20 percent evaluation even when erectile
power has been restored by means of a penile implant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
VA does not concur. Under diagnostic code 7522, two distinct elements are required for a 20 percent evaluation: (1)
Penile deformity and (2) loss of erectile power. If either element is absent following insertion of a penile implant
or for any other reason the criteria for a 20 percent evaluation under this code are not met, and the instruction which
the commenter requests is therefore not warranted. VA regulations are binding upon all agencies within the Department
of Veterans Affairs, and neither BVA nor any other VA agency is free to adopt an official policy which is contrary to
established regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter also requested that we add a NOTE to diagnostic code 7522 indicating entitlement to special monthly
compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although loss of erectile power establishes entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k),
we do not believe that a NOTE to such effect in the rating schedule is warranted. The criteria regarding entitlement
to special monthly compensation are extensive, very complicated, and seldom correspond exactly to evaluation criteria
in the rating schedule. For that reason, it is important that raters refer to the regulations governing special monthly
compensation rather than relying on cross-references in the rating schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected to the proposed elimination of a compensable evaluation for loss of a single testicle under
diagnostic code 7524, alleging that such loss disrupts normal endocrine function and interferes with the maintenance
of secondary sex characteristics. VA does not concur. In fact, any retrogressive changes in secondary sex characteristics
even following removal of both testes after sexual maturity would occur slowly, if at all (Oswald S. Lowsley and T.J.
Kirwin, ``Clinical Urology'' 230 (Williams and Wilkins 1956)). A solitary testis is in most cases adequate to sustain
normal endocrine function without hormone replacement therapy. No significant employment handicap would likely
result from this condition and a compensable evaluation, in our judgment, is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter objected to the proposed elimination of the minimum rating of 20 percent for removal of the prostate
gland (diagnostic code 7526). VA does not concur. Because of the development of improved surgical techniques for
extraction of the prostate through the perineum, bladder, surrounding capsule, or urethra, a minimum disability
evaluation of 20 percent is not warranted. Often the only residual of this surgery is sterility, which is compensated
not under the rating schedule but by means of special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k). Should any other
disability result, it would be rated under the diagnostic code for injuries, infections, hypertrophy, and postoperative
residuals of the prostate gland (7527), with evaluations based on the criteria for voiding dysfunction or urinary
tract infections. In our judgment, this provision allows for a broad enough range of evaluations to rate residual
disability as established by medical examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters urged that the previous convalescent period of one year following cancer treatment (diagnostic
code 7528) be retained, stating that the complexity of certain medical procedures, the wide variety of possible side-effects,
and the time required to recover from treatment precludes any realistic reduction of these recuperative periods.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters appear to have misinterpreted the proposed rule to mean that a convalescent evaluation will terminate
after six months. The rule actually requires an examination, not a reduction, six months after the assignment of total
benefits. If the claimant remains totally disabled, the 100 percent evaluation will continue without interruption.
If a reduction in evaluation is warranted, it will be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This application of total convalescence evaluations will take into account the wide array of possible side-effects
and complications of treatment by ensuring that any changes in evaluation are supported by the specific findings
of a current medical examination. A total evaluation will extend indefinitely after treatment is discontinued,
with a required VA examination six months thereafter. If the results of this or any subsequent examination warrant
a reduction in evaluation, the reduction will be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). There can be
no reduction at the end of six months since any proposed reduction would be based on the examination and the notification
process can begin only after the examination is reviewed. This method also has the advantage of offering the veteran
more contemporary notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any proposed action and, under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e), expanding the opportunity to present evidence
showing that the proposed action should not be taken. We have revised the wording of the NOTE based upon the concerns
of the commenters, however, to ensure that it cannot be misinterpreted as requiring a reduction six months after treatment
is terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters objected to the elimination of a minimum 10 percent evaluation following treatment of cancer
under diagnostic code 7528. One commenter stated that malignancies of this kind result in a ``permanent mental fixation.''
Another commenter stated that there may be residual damage to the genitourinary system from radiation treatment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA acknowledges that disability often follows cancer treatment, and residual impairment of the genitourinary system
will accordingly be rated as either voiding or renal dysfunction. Although any residual warranting compensation
would be ascertainable on VA examination, the existence of such residuals cannot be presumed in every case. Psychiatric
or any other complications are subject to service connection under 38 CFR 3.310(a) of this chapter. The recurrence
of cancer at any time would warrant restoration of the 100 percent evaluation. Rating the actual residuals will in
our judgment allow assignment of an evaluation reflecting the true severity of the individual disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that because the proposed amendments included reductions in certain percentage evaluations,
VA was exceeding the GAO mandate to review the rating schedule for the purpose of updating medical terminology and
evaluation criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA does not concur. VA's mandate to review the rating schedule derives from the statutory authority which Congress
has granted the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adopt a schedule of ratings, including the authority to establish
percentage evaluations (38 U.S.C. 1155). Although GAO may recommend that the Secretary review the schedule from
a particular perspective, it has no authority to limit the scope of any review which the Secretary subsequently conducts
under that statutory authority. The GAO recommendations resulted from a study finding that the rating schedule uses
outdated medical terminology, contains ambiguous rating criteria, and does not reflect recent medical advances.
If it is to conduct a good faith review, particularly when considering medical advances, VA cannot preclude the possibility
that some evaluations may be changed. Congress, in fact, specifically foresaw such a possibility when it enacted
legislation to amend 38 U.S.C. 1155 in order to protect the level of evaluations assigned under superseded rating
criteria. (See 137 Cong. Rec. H5928 (daily ed. July 29, 1991) (statement of Rep. Montgomery).)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter implied that the proposed changes could not be made without statistical studies showing the economic
impact of genitourinary impairments on disabled individuals. He cited a statistical study conducted in the 1960s
which he contends does not support the proposed reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute authorizing establishment of the schedule directs that ``[t]he Secretary shall from time to time readjust
the schedule of ratings 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in accordance with experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (emphasis supplied). Rather than requiring statistical studies or any other specific type of data, the statute
clearly leaves the nature of the experience which warrants an adjustment, and by extension the manner in which any
review is conducted, to the discretion of the Secretary. Although during the 1970s VA considered adjusting the rating
schedule based on the same statistical studies cited by the commenter, that approach proved to be unsatisfactory
and the proposed changes were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allow as much public participation in the process as possible, we published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 21, 1989 (54 FR 34531&hyph;2). We received responses from VA employees, the Naval Physical Evaluation Board,
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Director of Urology Programs at the National Institutes
of Health, and the general public. We also contracted with an outside consultant to suggest revisions. In formulating
recommendations, the consultant convened a five-member panel of physicians, each specializing in a different aspect
of urology. We developed our proposed changes only after reviewing all of the material received in response to the
ANPRM, from the consultant, and from specialists from the Veterans Health Administration in renal diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believed that the proposed changes did not reflect the average person's ability to cope with genitourinary
disorders as 38 U.S.C. 1155 requires, but were instead based upon optimum success in overcoming the effects of disease
and the results of surgery. Presumably the commenter was referring to the convalescent periods specified under various
diagnostic codes in this portion of the schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA does not concur. 38 U.S.C. 1155 directs that ``ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments
of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.'' The word ``average,'' as used in the statute,
refers to the ``usual or normal kind, amount, quality, rate, etc.'' (``Webster's New World Dictionary,'' Third College
Edition). We have outlined above the range of medical advice available to us when we conducted this review. The convalescent
periods adopted in this change represent in our judgment, based on sound medical advice, neither the longest nor shortest
periods that any individual patient might require for recovery, but the usual or normal periods during which a normal
patient, under normal circumstances, would be expected to recover from a specific condition or surgical procedure.
We also note that these convalescent periods represent the point at which the individual patient's condition is to
be evaluated by examination, and do not preclude an extension of a total evaluation if appropriate based on the individual
patient's condition. (See comments regarding diagnostic code 7528.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter believed that certain changes were proposed ``with an eye towards cost cutting.'' As discussed
above, the revisions were proposed based on medical considerations; no cost studies or projections were conducted
in conjunction with this review. Cost cutting therefore was not an issue, and we believe that these revisions will
prove to have negligible budget impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that VA should consider the effects of genitourinary conditions on life expectancy when revising
this portion of the rating schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA does not concur. To consider a factor so far removed from ``the average impairments of earning capacity'' as the
effects of various conditions on life expectancy would clearly exceed the parameters established by Congress in
38 U.S.C. 1155.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter contended that it would be unfair for VA to reduce any of the evaluations in the current rating schedule
because doing so could prevent some veterans from maintaining their current levels of evaluation and thereby deprive
them of the protection which would otherwise attach to those evaluation levels after 20 years under the provisions
of 38 U.S.C. 110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA does not concur. In section 103(a) of the Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;86),
Congress modified 38 U.S.C. 1155 to provide that a readjustment to the rating schedule will not result in a reduction
of any disability evaluation in effect on the date of the readjustment unless that disability has actually improved.
The statute effectively protects against the situation which the commenter anticipates. Since no evaluation may
be reduced solely due to a readjustment to the rating schedule, a readjustment cannot compromise the potential for
any veteran to have an evaluation preserved under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that VA allow special monthly compensation at the level for aid and attendance whenever a
veteran requires hemodialysis three or more times a week. Another commenter suggested that we allow special monthly
compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) for loss of a single kidney. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA does not concur. The entitlement criteria for special monthly compensation are established by Congress and codified
at 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) through (s). Regulations implementing these statutory grants of special monthly compensation
are found in VA's Adjudication regulations (38 CFR part 3) rather than in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38
CFR part 4). This issue is therefore beyond the scope of the current rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA appreciates the comments submitted in response to the proposed rule, which is now adopted with the amendments noted
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretary has determined that this regulatory
amendment is non-major for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It will not have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,
or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export
markets.

in each of these symptom areas. Where diagnostic codes refer the decisionmaker to these specific areas dysfunction,
only the predominant area of dysfunction shall be considered for rating purposes. Since the areas of dysfunction
described below do not cover all symptoms resulting from genitourinary diseases, specific diagnoses may include
a description of symptoms assigned to that diagnosis.

with dental and oral conditions. This amendment is based on a General Accounting Office study noting that there has
been no comprehensive review of the rating schedule since 1945, and recommending that such a review be conducted.
The effect of this action is to update this portion of the rating schedule to ensure that it uses current medical terminology,
unambiguous criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In December 1988, the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accounting Office recommended that VA prepare a plan for a comprehensive review of the rating schedule and, based
on the results, revise the medical criteria accordingly. As part of the process to implement these recommendations,
VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 4.150 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4961&hyph;2). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions
or objections on or before March 22, 1993. We received one comment from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For limited motion of the temporomandibular joint under diagnostic code 9905, we proposed evaluation criteria containing
precise ranges of limited inter-incisal motion and lateral excursion. For a 10 percent evaluation under limited
inter-incisal movement, we proposed a range of 31 to 40 millimeters. The commenter suggested that we replace this
criterion with the phrase ``any limitation of motion interfering with mastication or speech,'' which was essentially
the same requirement for a 10 percent evaluation under diagnostic code 9905 in the 1945 Rating Schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not concur with the suggested change. One of our goals in reviewing the rating schedule is to eliminate ambiguous
rating criteria. One means of accomplishing this is to make the criteria as objective as possible. Inter-incisal
measurements are a commonly accepted standard for objectively assessing movement of the temporomandibular joint,
and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use will ensure that comparable medical conditions are assigned comparable evaluations. Since the maximum inter-incisal
opening is between 40 and 60 millimeters, 31 to 40 millimeters represents the lowest range of limitation which might
interfere with mastication or speech while preserving an objective standard. For these reasons, we do not believe
any change in the proposed criteria is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA appreciates the comment submitted in response to the proposed rule, which is now adopted without amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretary has determined that this regulatory
amendment is non-major for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It will not have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,
or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export
markets.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 11, 1993, the State of Connecticut submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The
SIP revision consists of State Order No. 7019.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies Corporation (UTC), located at Windsor Locks, CT, operates
several boilers which emit sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). On April 6, 1990, the Hamilton Standard Division received a notice of violation from the Connecticut Department
of Environmental Protection (CT DEP). Dispersion modeling done by CT DEP showed potential violations of the 3-hour
and 24-hour Connecticut Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) and National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. TRC Consultants, under contract to UTC, performed a subsequent dispersion modeling study to determine which actions
UTC could take to prevent these violations. In June, 1991, TRC provided a report which recommended a compliance strategy
for UTC to follow. On January 7, 1993, CT DEP issued State Order No. 7019, which requires UTC to implement this compliance
strategy.

Summary of SIP Revision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SIP revision consists of Connecticut State Order No. 7019. The order makes certain recommendations contained
in the TRC report entitled

 CAAQS/NAAQS Compliance at the Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies Corporation Windsor Locks, Connecticut
Facility legally binding on UTC. These recommendations are based on modeling done by TRC in accordance with EPA and
Connecticut DEP modeling guidance. The Modeling study used the ISCST and PTMTPA-CONN models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under State Order No. 7019, UTC will be required to take the following actions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Concerning the four boilers designated 518(41), 519(42), 520(43), and 521(44), not more than three (3) may be
operated simultaneously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Boilers 519(42) and 520(43) shall burn only Natural Gas or No. 6 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding 1.0%,
and boilers 518(41) and 521(44) shall burn only No. 6 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding 1.0%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Boilers 506(48) and 505(49) shall burn either natural gas or No. 4 or No. 2 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding
0.3%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Test Cell D and Test Cell E shall be restricted to burning Jet-A fuel with sulfur content not exceeding 0.3%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The stack heights of Boilers 518(41), 519(42), 520(43), and 521(44) shall be increased to not less than 23.4 meters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State Order No. 7019 contains requirements that UTC keep records of the sulfur content of each purchase of fuel, and
specifies the dates for the commencement and completion of the higher stacks required by the order. These records
will allow the state to monitor compliance. State Order No. 7019 also contains a schedule of fines which UTC must pay
if a violation occurs, as well as the name and address of the person at the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection to whom payments are to be sent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed State Order No. 7019 and has determined that the restrictions in sulfur content and the increases
in stack height are sufficient to maintain the NAAQS in the vicinity of UTC's facility in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice unless, by February 17, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such
notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent
notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal
of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action
will be effective on March 21, 1994.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving State Order No. 7019 dated March 11, 1993 and effective in the State of Connecticut on February 19,
1993. The order is supported by a modeling study which demonstrates attainment of the NAAQS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 revisions (54 FR 2222) from the
requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B)
and 188(a) of the CAA, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990.

 (FR) 56694 (November 6, 1991), and 57 FR 13498 and 13537 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning requirements for
moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts one and four of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part D, title I of the CAA.

The 1990 CAAA made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that
significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the PM&hyph;10 National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (see Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the CAAA, 42

The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs
and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those state submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4) of the CAA were
to submit SIPs to the EPA by November 15, 1991. The CAA outlined certain required items to be included in the SIPs. These
required items, due November 15, 1991, unless otherwise noted, include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of PM&hyph;10 in the nonattainment
area (section 172(c)(3) of the CAA); (2) a permit program to be submitted by June 30, 1992, which meets the requirements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of section 173 for the construction and operation of new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(section 189(a)(1)(A)); (3) a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan provides for attainment
of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that
attainment by that date is impracticable (section 189(a)(1)(B)); (4) provisions to assure that Reasonably Available
Control Measures (RACM), including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), for control of PM&hyph;10
will be implemented no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 10, 1993 (sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). For sources emitting insignificant (de minimis) quantities
of PM&hyph;10, the EPA's policy is that it would be unreasonable and would not constitute RACM to require controls
on the source. Please reference 57 FR 13540. Also, when evaluating RACM and RACT, technological and economical feasibility
determinations are to be conducted (57 FR 13540&hyph;13544); (5) quantitative emission reduction milestones which
are to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate reasonable further
progress (RFP) toward attaining the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (section 189(c)); (6) contingency measures due November 15,
1993 (please reference 57 FR 13543), that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to make
RFP or to attain the primary standards by the applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); and (7) control requirements for
major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, unless the EPA determines inappropriate. The CAA, in section
189(e), states that control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 will also be applicable
to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources
do not significantly contribute to PM&hyph;10 levels that exceed the PM&hyph;10 ambient standards in the area.

Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA received one comment letter from Chevron U.S.A. Products Company on its October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52467&hyph;52474),
FR proposal to approve the El Paso moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP, including the proposal to approve
the El Paso PM&hyph;10 SIP as meeting the requirements of section 179B of the CAA regarding implementation plans and
revisions for international border areas. The letter expressed overall agreement with the EPA's proposal to approve
the El Paso PM&hyph;10 nonattainment SIP, but also posed one question regarding the three year progress report discussed
in the section entitled ``Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress'' (58 FR 52472). Chevron expressed overall
support for the three year PM&hyph;10 progress report requirement, beginning November 15, 1994, but questioned
whether the EPA should require as a part of the report an evaluation of any additional controls which may be feasible
to reduce exposures and/or bring the area into attainment. Chevron stated that since the EPA has found that the El Paso
area would not need any additional PM&hyph;10 control measures but for transborder PM&hyph;10, they did not see how
any additional controls could be justified as feasible for El Paso under the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA, in this final rulemaking action, is approving the El Paso PM&hyph;10 SIP because it shows timely attainment
of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS based on United States (El Paso County) emissions alone. Nevertheless, because the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS reflects public health and welfare standards, and because PM&hyph;10 NAAQS exceedances are still being monitored
in the El Paso nonattainment area, the EPA is encouraging the State of Texas to evaluate the feasibility of further
reductions in El Paso County PM&hyph;10 emissions beyond the amounts accounted for by the control measures put in
place by the PM&hyph;10 SIP being approved in this action. Additional reductions would further reduce the PM&hyph;10
concentrations to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso County population is exposed to by virtue of the additional contribution from international transport. Any
additional control measures found to be feasible by the State of Texas would be subject to full public notice and public
comment. The State of Texas has committed, provided that adequate information becomes available, to develop a contingency
plan for PM&hyph;10 in the El Paso area. The State also anticipates the continuation of a cooperative effort to study
PM&hyph;10 air quality in the El Paso/Juarez air basin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
In this final action, the EPA is granting approval of the El Paso, Texas, moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP
because it meets all of the applicable requirements of the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This SIP revision was submitted to the EPA by cover letter from the Governor of Texas dated November 5, 1991. On
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 8, 1993, the EPA announced its proposed approval of the moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for El
Paso (58 FR 52467&hyph;52474). In that rulemaking action, the EPA described in detail its interpretations of title
I and its rationale for proposing to approve the El Paso PM&hyph;10 SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual
issues presented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 58 FR 52474), and one comment letter
was received during the comment period, which ended on
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 8, 1993. This final action on the El Paso PM&hyph;10 SIP is unchanged from the October 8, 1993, proposed approval
action. The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action that the EPA is now finalizing.
The public is referred to the October 8, 1993, proposed approval FR action for a full discussion of the action that the
EPA is now finalizing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA finds that the State of Texas' PM&hyph;10 SIP for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso nonattainment area meets the RACM/RACT requirement. The State of Texas included a listing of RACT, federally
enforceable in approved permits, being used at all major and other stationary sources in the El Paso area. In addition,
the EPA views the State's prescribed burning, fugitive dust, and residential wood combustion control measures in
Regulation I and the El Paso City Ordinance 9.38, as contingency measures that go beyond the core RACM control strategy.
The EPA is also approving the memorandum of understanding between the City of El Paso and the Texas Air Control Board
(TACB) (now the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission), which serves to define the division of responsibility
for, and the commitments to carry out, the provisions of Regulation I and Chapter 9.38 of the City Code (City of El Paso
episodic curtailment program regarding wood combustion).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Texas referenced section 179B of the CAA when presenting their modeling demonstration for El Paso. The
demonstration showed that the El Paso PM&hyph;10 moderate nonattainment area would be in attainment of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS both currently and by December 31, 1994, based on dispersion modeling of United States (El Paso County) PM&hyph;10
emissions alone. After review, the EPA found the demonstration to be satisfactory. Details of the EPA's evaluation
were discussed in the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 8, 1993, proposed approval action and in the EPA's Technical Support Document. Accordingly, the EPA is approving
the demonstration as showing that the SIP provides for timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS but for emissions
emanating from Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also granting the El Paso PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area the exclusion from PM&hyph;10 precursor control
requirements authorized under section 189(e) of the CAA. Finally, to satisfy section 189(c) of the CAA (regarding
quantitative milestones and RFP), the State of Texas will report to the EPA every three years, beginning on November
15, 1994, the following information regarding the El Paso nonattainment area: (1) The status and effectiveness of
the existing controls, including quantification of emission reductions achieved relative to those projected in
the El Paso PM&hyph;10 SIP submittal; (2) significant changes in the inventory due to new source growth or other activities
(to allow for a comparison with the 1990 base year PM&hyph;10 emission inventory, and the projected 1994 PM&hyph;10
emission inventory); and (3) an evaluation of any additional controls which may be feasible to reduce exposures and/or
bring the area into attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action makes final the action proposed at 58 FR 52467 (October 8, 1993). As noted elsewhere in this action, the
EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has
reclassified this action from table one to table three under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214,
January 19, 1989, and revised via memorandum from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to the Regional
Administrators dated

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 2, 1992. The revisions concern rules from the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District
(SJVUAPCD) which is comprised of the following eight air pollution control districts (APCDs): Fresno County APCD,
Kern County APCD, Kings County APCD, Madera County APCD, Merced County APCD, San Joaquin County APCD, Stanislaus
County APCD, and Tulare County APCD. This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved
SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in
accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control
VOC emissions from vegetable oil processing and from can and coil coating operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing the
approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals,
SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 2, 1992 at 57 FR 40157, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SJVUAPCD Rule
461.2, Vegetable Oil Processing Operations, and SJVUAPCD Rule 460.4, Can and Coil Coating Operations. Rule 461.2
was adopted by SJVUAPCD on April 11, 1991; and Rule 460.4 was adopted by SJVUAPCD September 19, 1991. The rules were
submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 30, 1991 and January 28, 1992 respectively. The
rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment
areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that
interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above
rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the NPR cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPR cited above.
EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and
evaluations has been provided at 57 FR 40157 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX
office (TSDs for Rule 461.2 and 460.4 dated April 30, 1992 and March 12, 1992 respectively).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 30-day public comment period was provided at 57 FR 40157. EPA received no comments on rule 460.4. EPA received comments
on rule 461.2 from three sources: (1) The National Cottonseed Products Association (``NCPA''); (2) the J.G. Boswell
Company (``Boswell''); and (3) the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils, Inc (``Institute''). All three commented
on SJVUAPCD's definition of volatile organic compounds (``VOCs'')_suggesting that the definition not include
vegetable oil emissions. In addition, the NCPA and Institute also recommmended that SJVUAPCD rule 461.2 specify
performance standards or emissions limits rather than specific equipment for RACT controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary of comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule 461.2 defines VOC as ``any compound containing at least one atom of carbon except for the following exempt compounds.''
Vegetable oil is not listed as an exempt compound. The comments stated that the rule should exempt vegetable oil from
the definition of VOC because of its low volatility and because the EPA has determined that vegetable oil should not
be considered a VOC under EPA test methods.

Responses:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Rule 461.2 does not specify RACT for controlling VOC emissions from vegetable oil; rather, the purpose of the rule
is to establish RACT for controlling the VOC emissions from the processing operations which extract vegetable oil.
Hexane extraction of vegetable oil is known to cause substantial emissions of VOCs, and these are the types of emissions
that are controlled by Rule 461.2, not emissions from vegetable oil. The EPA policy memorandum dated April 1991 (``The
Impact of Declaring Soybean Oil Exempt from VOC Regulations on the Coatings Program'') specifically addresses cooking
processes which use vegetable oil. Besides, Rule 461.2 would not be considered defective even if it adopted a more
stringent definition of VOC than EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specification of Control Equipment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCPA and Institute commented that Rule 461.2 was defective because the rule specifies control technology rather
than a performance standard_the NCPA and the Institute argue that this approach will reduce flexibility and discourage
innovation in identifying control equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 461.2 provides that emissions from the desolventizer-toaster or extractor be controlled either by use of a condenser
and mineral oil scrubber with a 90% control efficiency, or with ``[a]n emission control device, with a combined capture
and control efficiency of at least 90 percent by weight, confirmed by source testing.'' EPA interprets this provision
of the rule as establishing a performance standard rather than as establishing a specific control technology in that
alternatives to the condenser and the scrubber are allowed as long as capture and control efficiency performance
standards are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the second requirement of Rule 461.2 (which states that emissions from the desolventizer-toaster conveyor,
cooler or tumbler, be controlled with a mineral oil scrubber that has a combined capture and control efficiency of
at least 90 percent by weight) does designate a specific control technology, EPA has not placed regulatory restrictions
on State and local agencies with respect to the range of acceptable measures and/or performance standards that must
be specified in a RACT rule. EPA believes that the State should decide the degree of flexibility to provide to regulated
industry in selecting acceptable control measures and/or performance standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal
under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D of the CAA. This approval action will
incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate
emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600

et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this action, EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment
of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment
area PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for Missoula. In this final rule, EPA also approves the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, except
several rules regarding emergency procedures, permitting, open burning, wood-waste burners, new source performance
standards, hazardous air pollutant standards, and variances. EPA will propose separate action on these rules when
the State fulfills its related commitments. One commitment has been fulfilled (see the This Action section of this
document for more information). If the State fails to fulfill the remainder of its commitments, EPA will take appropriate
action. Further, EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's odor provisions.

submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those States containing initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

15, 1991: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also apply to major stationary sources of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified
major stationary sources of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 that
become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to
achieve RFP or to attain the PM

On September 15, 1993, EPA announced its proposed approval of the Missoula, Montana moderate nonattainment area
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP, including parts of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as meeting those moderate nonattainment
area PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343). In that proposed rulemaking action and related
Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of title I and its rationale for proposing
to approve the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 58 FR 48343), and comments from the
State of Montana and Stone Container Corporation were received during the comment period, which ended on October
15, 1993. (For further discussion of these public comments, please see below and the Addendum to the TSD for EPA's proposed
rulemaking action on this SIP.) This final action on the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP, and portions of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, is unchanged from the September 15,
1993 proposed approval action, except for two typographical errors noted by EPA. First, in the table describing sources,
controls, emission reductions, and effective dates, the effective date for the Louisiana-Pacific permit modification
should have been listed as March 20, 1992 instead of January 23, 1992, as indicated. Second, under the Enforceability
Issues section, the final modification date for Stone Container Corporation's air quality permit #2589-M should
have been January 23, 1992 instead of November 25, 1992, as indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the September 15, 1993 proposed rule for a more in-depth discussion of the action now being finalized.

II. Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA did not receive any adverse public comments regarding its September 15, 1993 proposed approval of the Missoula
moderate nonattainment area PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343). However, the State of Montana submitted comments for clarification purposes, and
Stone Container Corporation submitted comments to express general support for EPA's action. Comments were as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated September 24, 1993 from Jeff Chaffee, Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences,
to Amy Platt, EPA, and through verbal communications, the State indicated that since submitting the original moderate
nonattainment area PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for Missoula, it discovered a minor arithmetic error in its 24-hour attainment and maintenance demonstrations,
as well as an error in the way it had addressed background concentrations in both the 24-hour and annual attainment
and maintenance demonstrations. The background concentrations, i.e., naturally occurring PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations that cannot be controlled, had not been subtracted from the 24-hour and annual design values before
apportioning the credits derived from the outlined control measures. The State has corrected these calculations,
and with the adjustments, the 24-hour and annual attainment values (i.e., ambient PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 air quality levels achieved by 1995
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act calls for attainment by December 31, 1994. Section 188(c)(1). EPA interprets the State's demonstration
as providing for attainment by January 1, 1995. EPA is approving the State's demonstration on the basis of the de minimis
differential between the two dates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since these corrected calculations are based on properly handling the background concentration and since the adjusted
values still adequately demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS and do not represent major changes to those considered in EPA's proposed action, EPA is proceeding with its approval
of this SIP. There is no need to adopt additional control measures based on these adjusted calculations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were also received in an October 11, 1993 letter from Larry Weeks, Stone Container Corporation, to Amy Platt,
EPA. The comments were not adverse and expressed general support for EPA's action on the Missoula PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP. However, several of Stone Container's comments indicate a misunderstanding of EPA's intended action on this
SIP and need further explanation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, EPA did not propose to approve the odor control rules contained in the SIP submittal and Stone Container communicated
its support but referenced ``Montana's odor control rules.'' EPA's action regarding odor regulations applies specifically
to the Missoula City-County regulation (Chapter IX, Subchapter 14, Rule 1427) contained in the SIP submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, Stone Container submitted comments suggesting it viewed the reduction in allowable PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from its No. 5 recovery boiler as voluntary reductions. Stone Container's recovery boilers were identified
by chemical mass balance receptor modelling to contribute 8.1% of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ambient concentrations in Missoula. The SIP submittal demonstrated that Stone Container is contributing to the
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment problem in the Missoula and vicinity nonattainment area and that reductions in allowable emissions
from recovery boiler No. 5 are part of an enforceable permit that are necessary to demonstrate expeditious attainment
of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the area. EPA agrees with the State's judgement that the reduction in allowable emissions from recovery boiler
No. 5 is necessary to ensure expeditious attainment of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the area. EPA's final approval of this limitation means that it will become part of the federally enforceable
implementation plan. See, e.g., sections 113 and 302(q) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, Stone Container commented that because EPA proposed to approve the control requirement exclusion for major
stationary sources of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 precursors authorized by section 189(e) of the Act, it would not make sense for the SIP to include contingency measures
that would call for limitations on industrial sources. Contingency measures for moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas are due to EPA no later than November 15, 1993 and were not submitted by the State as part of the SIP
revisions being addressed in this action. Thus, this comment is misplaced and does not address a matter within the
scope of the September 15, 1993 proposed action on the SIP submittals for the Missoula area. For clarification purposes,
EPA simply notes that EPA's finding that major sources of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Missoula addresses PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

 precursors only. Note that this finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing
mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors
in the area. Stone Container has been shown to be currently contributing to primary PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, since Stone Container has been shown to contribute to the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ambient concentrations in Missoula, contingency measures that include limitations on its emissions could be sought
by the State. Although Stone Container is located outside the nonattainment area, it is still a contributing source
(approximately 8% of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ambient concentrations in Missoula). Therefore, it may be necessary and reasonable to include emission reductions
at Stone Container as part of the contingency measures for Missoula. EPA will reserve judgement on the adequacy of
any contingency measures submitted by the State until such time as EPA receives a contingency measure submittal and
provides public notice and opportunity for public comment on its adequacy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
The Governor of Montana submitted the Missoula PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP with a letter dated June 4, 1992, and requested that EPA take action on the June 4, 1992 submittal together with the
August 20, 1991 submittal of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program. The submittals taken together
were intended to satisfy those moderate nonattainment area PM

 SIP requirements due for Missoula on November 15, 1991. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343,

 SIP that were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted on August 20, 1991 and June 4, 1992. In this final action, EPA is
also announcing its approval of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations (which were
submitted on August 20, 1991 and June 4, 1992) except for the following provisions: Chapter IX&hyph;Subchapter 4,
Emergency Procedures; Subchapter 11, Permit, Construction &amp; Operation of Air Contaminant Sources; Subchapter
13, Open Burning; Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners, Rule 1423, Standard of Performance for New Stationary
Sources (NSPS), Rule 1424, Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), and Rule 1427, Control of
Odors in Ambient Air; and Chapter X, Variances. EPA described the deficiencies associated with these rules in its
notice of proposed rulemaking and the TSD for that action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that the State of Montana's PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for the Missoula moderate nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. Five sources/source categories were identified
as contributing to the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment problem in Missoula and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP. The State has demonstrated
that by applying control measures to area sources (re-entrained road dust, residential wood combustion, prescribed
burning, and motor vehicle exhaust), as well as reducing allowable emissions through air quality permit modifications
for Louisiana-Pacific and Stone Container, Missoula will be in attainment by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2). It
does not appear that applying further control measures to these sources would expedite attainment. EPA views the
following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions reductions in Missoula: (a) Missoula County Rule 1401(7), which sets sanding and chip sealing standards
and street sweeping and flushing requirements; (b) Missoula County Rule 1401(9), which establishes liquid de-icer
requirements; (c) industry permit modifications made to reduce allowable PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from Stone Container Corporation's recovery boiler No. 5 and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's particle
board dryers; and (d) the Federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover. Further,
although no credit was claimed in the SIP, EPA is approving the following measures to make them federally enforceable
and to further strengthen the SIP. The measures provide additional PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 air quality protection. These measures are: (a) Missoula County Rule 1428, which sets standards for the regulation
for solid fuel burning devices; and (b) Missoula County Rule 1310(3), which sets standards for the regulation of prescribed
wildland open burning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including
available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented,
can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Missoula moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that
it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment plan for Missoula will result in the attainment of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2). By this notice EPA is approving the Missoula PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 moderate nonattainment area plan's control measures as satisfying the RACM, including RACT, requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, EPA did not propose approval, nor is EPA taking final action, on some portions of the Missoula City-County
Air Pollution Control Program regulations. To address EPA-identified deficiencies in the Missoula and statewide
SIP, the State committed to complete additional tasks to correct these deficiencies (except the concerns EPA raised
regarding the variance provisions). A more detailed explanation of the State's commitments can be found in EPA's
September 15, 1993 proposed approval of the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343) and the TSD for that action). Since none of the rules associated with these commitments
has an impact on the attainment demonstration, credited control strategies in the Missoula PM

 nonattainment area due to EPA on November 15, 1991, EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, when such commitments
are fulfilled by the State, and also will address the variances chapter at that time. Further, EPA is declining to take
action on Chapter IX, Subchapter 14: Rule 1427, Control of Odors in Ambient Air. These odor provisions do not have a
reasonable connection to the NAAQS-related air quality goals of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has fulfilled one commitment to revise its NSPS and NESHAPs regulations to incorporate all Federal requirements
promulgated through July 1, 1992. In a March 9, 1993 submittal, the State satisfied this commitment, and EPA will announce
its action on these revisions in a separate notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document announces EPA's final action on the action proposed at 58 FR 48339. As noted elsewhere in this final action,
EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has
reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January
19, 1989.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state
action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be file, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 16, 1990 (55 FR 20269), EPA approved a revision submitted by Maryland consisting of a bubble for the American
Cyanamid plant in Havre de Grace. EPA's approval action was incorporated by reference (IBR'd) into the Identification
of Plan section (40 CFR 52.1070) of the federally-approved Maryland SIP, and was assigned paragraph &sect;52.1070(c)(87).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequently, it was discovered that 40 CFR 52.1070(c)(87) had already been assigned to a prior EPA approval action
of a revision to the Maryland SIP. Accordingly, an editorial note was published in paragraph &sect;52.1070(c)(87),
explaining that EPA will correctly redesignate in a future notice the (c)(87) paragraph describing EPA's approval
of the American Cyanamid bubble. By this action, EPA redesignates the IBR paragraph associated with the May 16, 1990
approval action as &sect;52.1070(c)(91).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These regulations implement the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325, enacted July 23, 1992).
The Educational Opportunity Centers program provides grants to institutions of higher education; public and private
agencies and organizations; combinations of institutions, agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools
under special circumstances. The purposes of the program are to (1) provide information regarding financial and
academic assistance available for individuals who desire to pursue a program of postsecondary education; and (2)
assist individuals in applying for admission to institutions that offer programs of postsecondary education, including
preparing necessary applications for use by admissions and financial aid officers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is an analysis of the comments and changes in the regulations since the publication of the NPRM on October
26, 1993 (58 FR 57704). Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.
Minor changes_and suggested changes that the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable statutes_are
not generally addressed.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the Secretary change the regulations so that a competition for Educational Opportunity
Center (EOC) grants would be held once every two years. The commenter noted that such a schedule would be more efficient
than a 4-year schedule and would be more fair because applicants who were not funded could reapply more quickly.

Comment:

 Several commenters recommended that &sect;644.21(c)(5) be changed to require the Secretary to consider an applicant's
plan to coordinate its EOC project with other projects that serve disadvantaged students. The commenters maintained
that allotting points based on such a plan would encourage coordination among projects. Some commenters offered
specific langauge suggesting that the Secretary evaluate an applicant's plan of operation based in part on ``the
plan, including the project's organization structure, its coordination with other programs for disadvantaged
students sponsored by the sponsoring entity, and the time committed to the project by administrative and other staff,
to ensure the proper and efficient administration of the project.''

 The Secretary agrees that an applicant's plan to coordinate activities with other projects should be considered
in the selection criteria and that such consideration will encourage coordination. However, the Secretary recognizes
that in some cases an EOC project may be the only project for disadvantaged students administered by a particular institution
or agency. Therefore, the Secretary has adopted much of the suggested language but has included the modifier ``where
appropriate'' to ensure that applicants who administer only an EOC project will not be disadvantaged by their inability
to coordinate with other projects.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters suggested that the Secretary change &sect;644.22, relating to prior experience points. None of
the commenters asked the Secretary to change the wording of the criteria; all requested that the Secretary describe
in greater detail how the criteria are applied. Some commenters argued the regulations should require the Secretary
to notify grantees as to the number of points they received for prior experience before the funding determinations
are made. Commenters argued that such a procedure would allow grantees to ``correct errors'' in the Secretary's evaluation
of their prior experience. Other commenters suggested that the regulations should require the Secretary to award
a portion of the prior experience points each year based on a grantee's annual performance report. They suggested
that each grantee should be informed within a specified period as to how well each performance report was scored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also noted that the regulations should require the Secretary to award prior experience points based only
on a grantee's performance during the first two years of its grant. This procedure, they argued, would ensure that
a grantee's prior experience would be measured against actual outcomes rather than speculation about what the grantee
is likely to have accomplished by the end of the project period. Several commenters offered suggestions on how prior
experience points should be allocated under the two-year evaluation schedule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments suggest a high degree of anxiety over how the Secretary rates prior experience. The comments imply that
the assessment process should be continuous, extensive, and interactive. The Secretary, however, has no intention
of unnecessarily burdening grantees with such a process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;644.20(2)(i) of the regulations, the Secretary only evaluates prior experience when a grantee submits
an application for ``a new grant to continue to serve substantially the same populations or campuses that the applicant
is serving under an expiring grant.'' Prior experience is not evaluated until the Secretary receives such an application.
This procedure reflects the mandate expressed in section 402(A)(c)(1) of the Higher Education Act, which states:
``In making grants *&blank;*&blank;* the Secretary shall consider prior experience.'' The law requires the Secretary
to evaluate prior experience only when the Secretary is deciding to make a grant; the Secretary only decides to make
a grant if an application has been submitted. Thus, the final assessment of prior experience is conducted as part of
the overall process for selecting new grants. This process begins when applications are received and ends when applicants
are notified of the Secretary's funding decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application process is not an interactive process. After the closing date, no additional information is accepted
or considered. Therefore, any information that an applicant feels should be considered during the course of the selection
process should be provided before the closing date. The Secretary does not disclose information relating to the rank
of applications until all applicants are notified of the Secretary's funding decisions. After applicants receive
notification, they may request copies of documents that reflect the prior experience assessments.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters suggested that the Secretary amend &sect;644.30 of the proposed regulations to include college
admission fees and college entrance examination fees in the list of allowable costs. The commenters noted that many
adult EOC participants cannot afford to pay examination and application fees and are therefore discouraged from
pursuing postsecondary education.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees that admission fees should be included in the list of allowable costs because some adult participants
may be discouraged from applying to postsecondary institutions because of the expense associated with examination
and application fees. However, the Secretary strongly encourages Educational Opportunity Centers to work with
higher educational institutions to secure waivers whenever possible. Further, application fees will not be an allowable
cost under &sect;644.30 if the fee is paid to the grantee institution because the Secretary encourages grantees to
provide meaningful support to the Educational Opportunity Centers that they administer.

 Many commenters requested that the Secretary remove transportation, meals, and lodging from the list of unallowable
costs in &sect;644.31. The commenters further requested that the Secretary include transportation, meals, and
lodging in the list of allowable costs in &sect;644.30. Several commenters argued that campus visits are necessary
to help participants choose an appropriate postsecondary placement. Other commenters noted that such visits are
often impossible for EOC participants who reside in rural areas. Finally, some commenters argued that transportation,
meals, and lodging should be allowable costs because they are allowable under the Talent Search program.

 The Secretary believes that college visits are often necessary to help adult participants gain the confidence and
insight that they need to feel comfortable in applying for college admission. The Secretary agrees with the commenters
that it would be unfortunate if the cost of such visitations prevented some participants from pursuing postsecondary
education. Therefore, on a case-by-case basis, transportation, lodging, and meals may be allowable costs under
the circumstances described in the regulations.

What other requirements must a grantee meet? (&sect;644.32) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested that the Secretary should change &sect;644.32(d)(1) to read: ``Unless a part-time director
furthers coordination of the project with other programs for disadvantaged clients operated by the sponsoring institution
or agency, or unless a waiver is granted, a grantee shall employ a full-time project director.'' The commenters argued
that the change was necessary because the language in the NPRM does not reflect the intent of the 1992 Amendments to
the Higher Education Act, which requires the Secretary to encourage coordination among TRIO programs and other programs
for disadvantaged students and to allow for a less-than-full-time director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the Secretary require a full-time project director at all Educational Opportunity
Centers. The commenter noted that the degree of detail to which a director must be attentive requires a full-time commitment.
The commenter further suggested that coordination among projects is desirable and can be accomplished when various
directors work together for the mutual benefit of all projects on a single campus.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary strongly supports coordination of EOC activities between and among projects to extent that the coordination
fosters_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Improved services for the EOC participants; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) More efficient or effective means of delivering services; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An increase in the resources available to participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no magic formula for coordination. It only occurs when all partners see it in their best interest to cooperate
and coordinate activities to obtain some beneficial objectives. Projects do not have to share staff to coordinate
activities. Coordination can occur in a number of ways by staff at all levels. Having a part-time director does not
guarantee that coordination of activities will occur. Having a full-time director does not guarantee that the coordination
of activities will not occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each project is different in terms of its setting, resources, and support systems. The Secretary recognizes that
a project may effectively operate with less than a full-time director if other support personnel are in place to assist
in shared management duties. However, coordination can take many other forms. For example, coordination may be achieved
by planning and conducting joint or cooperative field trips, lectures, career days, or test-preparation sessions.
Coordination may also be achieved by sharing space or equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 644.32(d)(1) accurately reflects both the intent of the 1992 Amendments to the HEA and the Secretary's commitment
to coordination. Waivers of the requirement for a full-time director are available under &sect;644.32(d)(3) if
an applicant can show that efforts to coordinate among projects will be hindered by not allowing one person to direct
more than one project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that in many cases the size and scope of an EOC project require the attention of a full-time director.
The average EOC project receives more than a million dollars over the course of a project period and serves more than
eight thousand participants. Given the size and scope of EOC projects, the Secretary believes that the appropriateness
of allowing a part-time director must be evaluated with great care.

 Several commenters suggested that the Secretary should change &sect;644.32(c)(3), relating to records of educational
benefits. The commenters requested that the Secretary eliminate the phrase ``the specific educational benefits
to the participants that resulted from the services'' because keeping a record of how each participant benefited
from the services would be too burdensome. The commenters suggested that &sect;644.32(c)(3) require only that grantees
keep a record of ``the specific educational benefits

 The Secretary agrees that the phrase ``that resulted from the services'' implies that a grantee must demonstrate
and record a causal relationship between services and benefits. The Secretary believes that such a record is not necessary
to indicate a benefit, particularly in instances where the services provided can be deemed to be benefits in and of
themselves.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is extending coverage under Inmate Accident Compensation to inmates participating
in approved work assignments for other Federal agencies. Because inmates participating in such assignments may
be housed in a community corrections center, it is necessary to add procedures appropriate for the treatment and reporting
of injuries and for processing claims which may arise from such assignments. This amendment also clarifies the applicability
of lost-time wages, clarifies the effects of subsequent incarceration, clarifies the definition of ``release'',
clarifies payment procedures for medical treatment, and corrects a typographical error in the citation of a court
case. This amendment is intended to allow for the continued efficient operation of inmate work assignments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39096) a proposed rule on Inmate Accident Compensation clarifying its applicability to approved
inmate work assignments for other federal agencies. The proposed amendment also clarified that lost-time wages
shall be available only for inmates based at Bureau of Prisons institutions (see new &sect;301.201) and that the amount
of a payment for medical treatment is limited to reasonable expenses incurred, such as those amounts authorized under
the applicable fee schedule established for the Department of Health and Human Services Medicare program (see &sect;301.317).
This amendment also revised the definition of ``release'' in &sect;301.102 to include reference to pretrial inmates.
The proposed amendment also clarified &sect;301.316 by rewording its provisions regarding subsequent incarceration
of a compensation recipient. There is no change in the intent of this section. Finally, the proposed amendment corrected
a typographical error in the citation of the court case

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 26, 1991 (56 FR 35544), the Department of Justice (Department) published its final regulation implementing
title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) Public Law 101&hyph;336, which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of disability by private entities that own, lease, lease to, or operate a place of public accommodation,
and requires that all new places of public accommodation and commercial facilities, and all alterations to such facilities,
be designed and constructed so as to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.

Section 36.406 of the regulation, ``Standards for new construction and alterations,'' provides that new construction
and alterations subject to the regulation shall comply with the standards for accessible design published as appendix
A to the regulation. Appendix A contains the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings
and Facilities (ADAAG), which was separately published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance
Board (Access Board) as a final guideline on July 26, 1991 (56 FR 35408). On April 5, 1993, the Department issued a final
rule containing technical amendments to appendix A (58 FR 17521), which incorporated technical corrections to ADAAG
made by the Access Board on January 14, 1992 (57 FR 1393).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 36.406 of the title III regulation implements sections 306(b) and 306(c) of the ADA, which require the Attorney
General to promulgate standards for accessible design for buildings and facilities subject to the ADA, and require
those standards to be consistent with the supplemental minimum guidelines and requirements for accessible design
published by the Access Board pursuant to section 504 of the ADA. Sections 5 through 9 of appendix A are special application
sections and contain additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business
and mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. Section 10 of ADAAG, which was intended to establish
special access requirements for transportation facilities, was reserved when the Department's final rule was published
because the Access Board had not yet published that section of its minimum guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 6, 1991 (56 FR 45500), the Access Board published a final rule amending the guidelines by adding final
guidelines for transportation facilities as a new section 10, and on January 14, 1992 (57 FR 1393), the Access Board
published a final rule making corrections to that section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006), the Access Board published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to
amend the reach range requirements for accessible ATMs under ADAAG based on new information received in connection
with a petition for rulemaking. The Access Board's proposed amendment set out the reach ranges for controls when a
person using a wheelchair could make a forward approach only, a parallel approach only, or both a forward and parallel
approach to an ATM. To address the reach over an obstruction resulting from recessed controls and the installation
of fixtures called ``surrounds'' (which contain writing counters and bins for envelopes and waste paper), in front
of ATMs, the proposed amendment included a table of reach depths and maximum heights for the placement of the controls
where the reach depth to any control is more than 10 inches from a parallel approach. A detailed discussion of the proposed
amendment is contained in the Access Board's proposed rule. On November 17, 1992 (57 FR 54210), the Department of Transportation
issued an NPRM to amend its ADA regulations in several respects, including conforming the standards for transportation
facilities to incorporate the reach range requirements for ATMs. The amendment is relevant to transportation facilities
because fare vending machines are required to comply with the same requirements as ATMs. See ADAAG 10.3.1(7). On July
15, 1993 (58 FR 38204), the Access Board and the Department of Transportation published a joint final rule adopting
the proposed changes to the reach range requirements for ATMs and fare vending machines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17558), this Department published a proposed rule to amend appendix A to its title III regulation
to include section 10 of the Access Board's final guidelines, as amended (transportation facilities), and to adopt
the changes relating to the reach range requirements applicable to automated teller machines proposed by the Access
Board in its September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006) proposed rule. In the Department's proposed rule, it sated that ``[a]ll
timely comments received by the Board on the proposed transportation rule issued by the Board on March 20, 1991 (56
FR 11874), and on the proposed rule relating to ATM reach ranges issued by the Board on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006),
will be deemed by the Department to have been submitted in response to this proposed rule and will be thoroughly analyzed
and considered by the Department prior to the adoption of any final rule. Therefore, it is not necessary for any timely
comments submitted to the Board on those proposed rules to be resubmitted to the Department.'' Any new comments on
the Department's proposed rule were due on or before May 5, 1993.

The Department of Justice is adopting as a final rule the accessibility guidelines for transportation facilities
published by the Access Board as a final rule on September 6, 1991, as amended by the Access Board on January 14, 1992,
and as further jointly amended on July 15, 1993, by the Access Board and the Department of Transportation, to reflect
changes relating to reach range requirements.

The Department is also adopting as a final rule the proposed amendment to the reach range requirement for ATMs. As stated
in the Department's NPRM, all timely comments received by the Access Board on the proposed transportation and ATM
rules have been analyzed by the Department in connection with this final rule. An analysis of these comments is contained
in the final rules issued by the Access Board and referenced above, and the Department concurs with the Access Board's
analysis. In addition to the comments previously received by the Access Board, the Department directly received
seven comments in response to its NPRM. Of these seven comments, three substantially duplicated comments on the proposed
revisions to ATM requirements previously sent to the Access Board by the same commenters, and two addressed issues
not covered by the NPRM. Of the two new comments on issues raised by the NPRM, one expressed support for both the proposed
transportation and the proposed ATM provisions without discussing any rationable for such support, and on comment,
submitted by an advocacy group, opposed the changes to ATM reach range requirements on the ground that the changes
would not make ATMs readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, but did not include any additional
documentation.

Regulatory Process Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department has determined that this final rule is not a major rule under E.O. 12291. Accordingly, a regulatory
impact statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities. Therefore, it is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also has determined that there are no Federalism impacts sufficient to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Empowerment Zones program confers upon rural distressed American communities the opportunity to take effective
action to create jobs and opportunities. The program combines tax benefits with substantial investment of Federal
resources and enhanced coordination among Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All communities which complete the nomination process will be strengthened by it; gaining by taking stock of their
assets and problems, by creating a vision of a better future, and by structuring a plan for achieving their vision.
Local partnerships among community residents, businesses, financial institutions, service providers, neighborhood
associations and State and local governments will be formed or strengthened by going through the application process.
Communities will be afforded an opportunity to work with these partners in the creation and implementation of a community-based
strategic plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communities that are not designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities are eligible for certain benefits.
Under a separate program directed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community Development Corporations
(CDCs) nominated by the locality, or the applicant for the Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, will be considered
eligible for designation to receive tax preferred contributions from donors. HUD has committed to designating eight
rural CDCs for this program. Communities with innovative visions for change will be considered for requested waivers
of Federal program regulations, flexible use of existing program funds, and cooperation in meeting essential mandates,
even if they do not receive a designation by the Secretary as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communities that are designated as Enterprise Communities receive a number of benefits. Enterprise Communities
are eligible for new Tax-Exempt Facilities Bonds for certain private business activities. States with designated
Communities will receive Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grants (EZ/EC SSBG) in the
amount of approximately $3 million for each rural Enterprise Community to pass through to each designated area for
approved activities identified in the strategic plans. Enterprise Communities receive special consideration
in competition for funding under numerous Federal programs, including the new National Service and Community Policing
initiatives. The Federal Government will focus special attention on working cooperatively with designated Enterprise
Communities to overcome regulatory impediments, to permit flexible use of existing Federal funds, and to assist
these Communities in meeting essential mandates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communities that are designated as Empowerment Zones receive all of the benefits provided to Enterprise Communities,
in addition to other benefits. States with designated Empowerment Zones will receive Empowerment Zone/Enterprise
Community Social Service Block Grants in the amount of $40 million for each rural Empowerment Zone. Employer Wage
Credits for Empowerment Zone residents are provided to qualified employers engaged in trade, business, or human
service delivery in designated Empowerment Zones. Businesses are afforded an increased deduction under section
179 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rural part of the program will be administered by USDA as a Federal-State-local-private partnership, with a minimum
of red tape associated with the application process. Applicants must demonstrate the ability to design and implement
an effective strategic plan for real opportunities for growth and revitalization, that deal with local problems
is a comprehensive way, and must demonstrate the capacity or the commitment to carry out these plans. Development
of an effective plan must also involve the participation of the community affected by the nomination of the rural area,
and of the private sector, acting in concert with the State or States and local governments. The plan should be developed
in accordance with four key principles, which will also serve as the basis for the selection criteria that will be used
to evaluate the plan. These key principles reflect the Secretary's intention that Empowerment Zone and Enterprise
Community designations should be based on potential for successful economic and community revitalization as reflected
in the strategic planning process, participants in the plan, and the quality of the plan. Poverty, unemployment,
and other need factors are critical in determining eligibility for Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community status,
but play a less significant role in the selection process. The four key principles are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Economic opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, entrepreneurial
initiatives, small business expansion, and training for jobs that offer upward mobility;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sustainable community development, to advance the creation of liveable and vibrant communities through comprehensive
approaches that coordinate economic, physical, environmental, community and human development;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Community-based partnerships, involving participation of all segments of the community, including the political
and governmental leadership, community groups, health and social service groups, environmental groups, religious
organizations, the private and non-profit sectors, centers of learning, other community institutions, and individual
citizens; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Strategic vision for change, which identifies what the community will become and a strategic map for revitalization.
The vision should build on assests and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. It should
also set goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for evaluating and adjusting
the revitalization plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local governments and economic development corporations that are state chartered may nominate distressed
rural areas for designation as Empowerment Zones (which will also permit their consideration for designation as
Enterprise Communities), or solely for designation as Enterprise Communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 included Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities as a new
program.

It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However,
exemptions are permitted where an agency finds, for good cause, that compliance would be impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to public interest. The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without
first soliciting public comment, in that prior public comment would be contrary to the public interest. The statute
requires that communities prepare a comprehensive strategic plan to submit their applications. For many communities,
such planning can take up to 5 months. Several additional months will be required to evaluate the applications and
make designations. Section 1391(c) of the legislation requires that designations be made only after 1993 and before
1996. Given the statutory mandate to make all designations within a two-year time period, the extra time required
to publish a proposed rule for a 60-day comment period before development of a final rule for effect would be contrary
to congressional intent and the purpose of the legislation. The longer time period would unduly postpone an economic
recovery for those communities and their residents for which this program is intended. Further, the Department finds
that good cause exists in that prior public comment is unnecessary because the legislation being implemented by this
rule is very prescriptive, with little room for discretion on the part of the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is interested, however, in the public reaction to the rule, and invites the public to comment. The Department
is limiting the comment period to 30 days to permit adequate time for review of public comments and development of a
final rule.

This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the
determination of USDA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality

This rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Review as a significant rule, as that term is defined
in Executive Order 12866, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993. The economic analysis required

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The Act is intended to encourage Federal agencies to utilize innovative administrative
procedures in dealing with individuals, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental bodies
that would otherwise be unnecessarily adversely affected by Federal regulations. To the extent that this rule affects
those entities, its purpose is to reduce any disproportionate burden by providing for the waiver of regulations and
by affording other incentives directed toward a positive economic impact. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility
analysis under the Act is necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. The purpose of this rule is to provide a cooperative atmosphere between the
Federal government and the States and local governments, and to reduce any regulatory burden imposed by the Federal
government that impedes the ability of State and local governments to solve pressing economic, social, and physical
problems in their communities.

The purpose of this program is to empower American communities and their residents to create jobs and opportunity,
take effective action to solve difficult and pressing economic, human, community and physical development challenges
of today, and to build for tomorrow as part of a Federal-State-local and private-sector partnership. Businesses
are to be encouraged to invest in distressed areas, thereby creating jobs, and comprehensive local strategic plans
are to be adopted and implemented, furthering community development and assisting in the revitalization of these
areas.

The Empowerment Zones program is a key step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities
and rural heartland. It is designed to empower people and communities across the nation in developing and implementing
strategic plans to create job opportunities and sustainable community development. The program combines tax benefits
with substantial investment of Federal resources and enhanced coordination among Federal agencies. All communities
which complete the nomination process will be strengthened by it, whether or not they are selected as Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities, as the Federal Government will work with applicants to overcome programmatic regulations
and statutory impediments to encourage more effective economic, physical, environmental and community development
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All communities will gain by taking stock of their assets and problems, by creating a vision of a better future, and
by structuring a plan for achieving it. Local partnerships among community residents, businesses, financial institutions,
service providers, neighborhood associations and State and local governments can be formed or strengthened to support
a plan for change by going through the application process. Communities will be afforded an opportunity to work with
these new partners in the creation and implementation of a community-based strategic plan. Community Development
Corporations nominated by the locality will be considered eligible for designation to receive tax preferred contributions
from donors. Communities with innovative visions for change will be considered for requested waivers of Federal
program regulations, flexible use of existing program funds, and cooperation in meeting essential mandates, even
if they do not receive a designation. Communities may apply comprehensive strategic planning to their entire community
anticipating proposed consolidation of planning requirements for four major formula grant programs administered
by the Office of Community Planning and Development in HUD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enterprise Communities are eligible for new Tax-Exempt Facilities Bonds for certain private business activities.
States with designated Enterprise Communities will receive approximately $3 million in Empowerment Zone/Enterprise
Community Social Service Block Grant funds to pass through to each designated area for approved activities identified
in their strategic plans. Enterprise Communities will receive special consideration in competition for funding
under numerous Federal programs, including the new National Service and proposed Community Policing initiatives.
The Federal Government will focus special attention on working cooperatively with designated Enterprise Communities
to overcome regulatory impediments, to permit flexible use of existing Federal funds, and to assist these Communities
in meeting essential mandates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Empowerment Zones will receive all the benefits provided to Enterprise Communities and other communities with innovative
visions for change. Empowerment Zones are awarded substantial Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service
Block Grant funds, in the amount of $100 million for each urban Zone. An Employer Wage Credit for Zone residents is extended
to qualified employers engaged in trade or business, in designated Empowerment Zones. Businesses are afforded an
increased deduction under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified properties.

The urban part of the program will be administered by HUD as a Federal-State-local partnership, with a minimum of red
tape associated with the application process. Communities must demonstrate the ability to design and implement
an effective strategic plan for real opportunities for growth and revitalization, that deal with local problems
in a comprehensive way and must demonstrate the capacity to carry out these plans. Development of an effective plan
must also involve the participation of the community affected by the nomination of the urban area, and of the private
sector, acting in concert with the nominating entities. The plan should be developed in accordance with four key principles,
which will serve as the basis for the key selection criteria that will be used to evaluate the plan. These principles
are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Economic Opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, as well as entrepreneurial
initiatives, small business expansion, and training for jobs that offer upward mobility;

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Sustainable Community Development, to advance the creation of liveable and vibrant communities through comprehensive
approaches that coordinate economic, physical, environmental, community and human development; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Community-Based Partnerships, involving participation of all segments of the community, including the political
and governmental leadership, community groups, health and social service groups, environmental groups, religious
organizations, the private and non-profit sectors, centers of learning and other community institutions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Strategic Vision for Change, which identifies what the community will become and a strategic map for revitalization.
The vision should build on assets and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. It should
also set goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for evaluating and adjusting
the revitalization plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local governments may nominate distressed urban areas for designation as Empowerment Zones (which will
also permit their consideration for designation as Enterprise Communities), or solely for designation as Enterprise
Communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
as a new program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Justification for Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking at 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides for exceptions from that general rule
where the Department finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement
is satisfied when prior public comment is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest'' (24
CFR 10.1). The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public
comment, in that prior public comment would be contrary to the public interest. Section 1391(c) of the legislation
requires that designations be made only after 1993 and before 1996. Given the statutory mandate to make all designations
within a two-year period, the extra time required to publish a proposed rule for a 60-day comment period before development
of a final rule for effect would be contrary to congressional intent and the purpose of the legislation. The longer
time period would unduly postpone an economic recovery for those communities and their residents for which this program
is intended. Further, the Department finds that good cause exists in that prior public comment is unnecessary because
the legislation being implemented by this rule is very prescriptive, with little room for discretion on the part of
the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is interested, however, in the public reaction to the rule, and invites the public to comment. Since
section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act provides that no rule promulgated by the Department
may become effective until 30 days after publication, and since section 1391(c) of the authorizing legislation requires
that designations be made within a two-year period, the Department is limiting the comment period to 30 days to permit
adequate time for review of public comments and development of a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has adopted a policy of setting a date for expiration of an interim rule unless a final rule is published
before that date. This ``sunset'' provision appears in &sect;597.1(c) of the rule, and provides that the rule will
expire on a date 12 months from publication unless a final rule is published before that date.

This rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Review as a significant rule, as that term is defined

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities within the intent and purpose of that Act. The Act is intended to encourage Federal agencies
to utilize innovative administrative procedures in dealing with individuals, small businesses, small organizations,
and small governmental bodies that would otherwise be unnecessarily adversely affected by Federal regulations.
To the extent that this rule affects those entities, its purpose is to reduce any disproportionate burden by providing
for the waiver of regulations and by affording other incentives directed toward a positive economic impact. Therefore,
no regulatory flexibility analysis under the Act is necessary.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined
that, although the policies contained in this rule may have a substantial direct effect on States or their political
subdivisions that are designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities, this effect is intended by the
legislation authorizing the program. The purpose of the rule is to provide a cooperative atmosphere between the Federal
government and States and local governments, and to reduce any regulatory burden imposed by the Federal government
that impedes the ability of States and local governments to solve pressing economic, social, and physical problems
in their communities.

to the extent that the program authorized by the rule will empower communities and their residents to take effective
action to solve difficult and pressing economic, human, community and physical development challenges that have
a negative impact on families. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further review under the Order.

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing regional meetings to discuss options for addressing certain
concerns expressed by a number of States in comments submitted to the NRC on the proposed rule on the environmental
review required for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. The concerns that will be addressed involve
provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States
to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need, reliability, cost, resource options, and other
non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The minutes will be transcribed by a court recorder in all regional
meetings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of the regional meetings is to gain the views of the States and other interested parties on how the NRC should
treat need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources in its final rule on the environmental review for
renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. The NRC published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish new requirements
for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants (September 17,
1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437, a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement
(GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in part 51. The public comment period on the proposed
rule, the GEIS, and other related documents closed on March 17, 1992. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft
GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating capacity, and alternative
energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict
with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need,
reliability, cost, resource options, and other non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission
instructed the NRC staff to develop options for responding to these State concerns. In developing the options the
staff is to solicit the views of the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff is soliciting the views of the States through four regional meetings and a request for written comments.
To facilitate discussions with the States the staff has prepared a paper, ``Addressing the Concerns of States and
Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit
Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper,'' which
may be either examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037, or obtained
from Donald P. Cleary at the address provided above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each meeting will be conducted in a panel format with panelists representing those States that submitted comments
on the treatment of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources, other interested States, electric
utilities, the NRC, and interest groups concerned with the economic regulation of electric utilities. All interested
persons are invited to attend as observers and time will be scheduled to take questions and comments from the floor.
The meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter. Written comments on the matters covered in the staff paper
and the meetings are invited. The public comment period will close on March 4, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each meeting will begin at 10 a.m. and, with a 1 hour lunch break, will continue until 5 p.m. if participation warrants.
Registration will be conducted one-half hour prior to the meeting.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its tamper-resistant packaging requirements to require
that all over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products marketed in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules be sealed. This
proposal follows continuing tampering incidents involving two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. The agency is also
proposing a change in terminology throughout its regulatory program from ``tamper-resistant`` to ``tamper-evident.``
In addition, FDA is soliciting comments on whether additional regulatory changes, such as packaging performance
standards, may be necessary. These proposed amendments are part of the agency's continuing review of the potential
public health threat posed by product tampering and are meant to address specific vulnerabilities in the OTC drug
market and to improve consumer protection.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend its tamper-resistant packaging regulation for OTC drug products in &sect;211.132 (21 CFR
211.132). The regulation requires that all OTC drug products (except dermatologics, dentifrices, insulin, and
throat lozenges) be in packaging designed to provide consumers with visible evidence of any tampering that has occurred.
FDA first adopted these requirements in 1982 to respond to the public health emergency in which seven persons in the
Chicago area died after taking cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules (47 FR 50442, November 5, 1982). Investigations
showed that the cyanide had been intentionally introduced into the capsules after they had reached the retail shelf.
Although the product's packaging met all FDA requirements at the time, it was not designed so that tampering would
leave visible evidence. The poisoning fatalities illustrated the risk that consumers of OTC drugs faced without
such protective packaging. FDA met with industry experts to explore ways to reduce this risk and to develop specific
recommendations for OTC drug packaging designs that would make malicious tampering more obvious. These recommendations
formed the basis of the agency's initial regulatory approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1982 regulation required that most OTC drug products be packaged in a tamper-resistant package, which was defined
in &sect;211.132(b) as packaging having an indicator or a barrier to entry that could reasonably be expected to provide
visible evidence to consumers that tampering had occurred. In addition to meeting this general standard, &sect;211.132(b)
required that the tamper-resistant feature be distinctive by design or use a barrier to entry that employed an identifying
characteristic such as a logo. The regulation further required that OTC product labeling alert consumers to the specific
packaging feature being employed (&sect;211.132(c)). All requirements of this regulation were in effect by February
6, 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA continued to monitor the effectiveness of its regulatory program and found that, while the program had resulted
in significant improvements in protecting consumers from tampering harm, OTC products marketed in two-piece, hard
gelatin capsules remained vulnerable to malicious tampering. In fact, all known fatalities from contaminated OTC
drugs, including three deaths in 1986_4 years after the tamper-resistant packaging requirements were first imposed_were
associated with this dosage form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing the persistent vulnerability of the hard capsule, the agency amended its tamper-resistant packaging
regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 2, 1989 (54 FR 5227), to require that OTC products marketed in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules be packaged
using at least two tamper-resistant features, unless the capsules were sealed using a tamper-resistant technology
(&sect;211.132(b)(1) and (b)(2)). FDA concluded that an additional packaging feature would reduce the dangers
posed by OTC drug tampering by making it more likely that the consumer would see signs of tampering when it occurred.
This requirement went into effect on February 2, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even with this extra level of regulatory protection, two-piece, hard gelatin capsules remain vulnerable to malicious
tampering and have been implicated in the latest fatalities. In February 1991, two persons in the State of Washington
died and another became gravely ill after ingesting counterfeit Sudafed capsules contaminated with cyanide. The
capsules had been packaged using a number of tamper-resistant packaging features that met FDA requirements. The
tampering was crudely done and left obvious signs: while both the counterfeit product and the Sudafed product were
in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules, the counterfeit capsules were larger than the legitimate Sudafed capsules,
lacked the company logo and ``Sudafed`` imprint, and lacked the blue gelatin band found on Sudafed capsules. In addition,
the foil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backing on the package's blister card had been cut, and lot numbers on the blister card did not match those on the carton.
The contaminated capsules also contained a yellowish powder, rather than the white granules contained in Sudafed
capsules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sudafed package and dosage form met FDA's tamper-resistant standard, providing visible signs of tampering that
were both numerous and conspicuous. The fact that physical harm from the tampering nonetheless occurred was of concern,
and illustrated the need for a renewed focus on consumer education and involvement in the effectiveness of tamper-resistant
or tamper-evident packaging. In response to this most recent incident, the agency convened a task force to review
existing regulatory strategies and to consider what further steps could be taken. The task force also considered
information provided by outside experts, including packaging scientists and representatives of drug manufacturing
trade associations. A number of options were discussed, including banning the use of two-piece, hard gelatin capsules
for OTC drug products or restricting their availability by requiring that they be kept behind the pharmacy counter.
These discussions balanced the value of the hard capsule dosage form to consumers against its continued vulnerability
to malicious tampering. Memoranda from these discussions are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) and are available for inspection between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During these discussions, FDA gave serious consideration to banning the use of two-piece, hard gelatin capsules,
but has tentatively concluded that such capsules should remain available for several reasons. First, FDA believes
that banning hard gelatin capsules because they have been associated with tampering may give consumers a false sense
of security that tampering with other dosage forms could no longer occur. Second, FDA believes that a ban would deprive
the public of a useful dosage form. The Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 indicated that the two-piece, hard gelatin capsule can have certain features not provided by other dosage forms that
are currently available. For example, many consumers prefer to take capsules, finding them easiest to swallow. In
addition, some medications can only be formulated in the capsule dosage form, due to detrimental effects on active
ingredients from tableting or other formulation processes. Hard gelatin capsules also may contain fewer inactive
ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, than some tablet and oral liquid formulations.
Moreover, the hard gelatin capsule dosage form is sometimes necessary to deliver timed-release medications. Given
the potential benefits of capsules, FDA believes that, at this time, it is appropriate to seek to decrease the risks
posed by product tampering through means other than banning two-piece, hard gelatin capsules.

This proposed rule is based on investigations and discussions surrounding the 1991 tampering fatalities, as well
as FDA's ongoing review of the public health threat from OTC drug product tampering. The proposal suggests some specific
regulatory measures for reducing the potential for tampering with the vulnerable hard capsule dosage form. It also
presents additional ideas for improving the effectiveness of current policies directed against product tampering
and invites public discussion and comment on these ideas. By proposing the regulatory changes and encouraging a dialogue
on the subject of improving anti-tampering measures and involvement of the consumer, the agency hopes to increase
protection of the public against malicious tampering.

A. Description of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend its tamper-resistant packaging regulation to decrease the potential for harm from tampering
involving two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. FDA also proposes to take certain steps to focus the attention of all
parties on the need to make consumers aware of the special packaging features that indicate that tampering has occurred.
The proposed changes complement a number of other actions that FDA is taking both to improve consumer awareness and
to encourage the development of better packaging technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One proposed change would amend the current regulation that establishes specific requirements for OTC products
marketed in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. As noted, this dosage form has been subject to the most serious tampering
incidents over the years. The regulation now requires that these products be packaged using a minimum of two tamper-resistant
packaging features, unless the capsules are sealed by a tamper-resistant technology, in which case, one packaging
feature is sufficient (&sect;211.132(b)(1) and (b)(2)). Proposed revisions to &sect;211.132(b)(2) would require
that any OTC drug product marketed in a two-piece, hard gelatin capsule be sealed using a technology that would provide
evidence that the capsule has been tampered with after filling. (Some capsule sealing technologies are described
in FDA's Compliance Policy Guide 7132a.17.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
) The proposed rule would no longer require that such products be packaged in a container with two tamper-resistant
packaging features. The proposed rule would require that the sealed capsules be in packaging employing a minimum
of one tamper-resistant feature, the requirement that applies to all other affected OTC dosage forms. The agency
believes that requiring OTC capsules to be sealed may decrease the likelihood that successful product tampering
will occur with this dosage form. This proposed change would not apply to one-piece, soft gelatin capsules, also known
as soft gels. FDA specifically requests comments on whether the proposed requirement to seal all two-piece, hard
gelatin capsules would adversely affect any patient population or specific drug entity or drug class.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is also proposing that the term used to describe the packaging requirements be changed from ``tamper-resistant''
to ``tamper-evident.'' FDA believes that the term ``tamper-evident'' more accurately describes the role of packaging
in reducing the likelihood of harm from tampering, and emphasizes the necessity of consumer involvement in the effectiveness
of any packaging system designed to meet the requirements of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in terminology is intended to underscore the view that no package design is tamper-proof. The packaging
of the Sudafed capsules did not prevent the 1991 tampering incidents, although it met FDA requirements and the evidence
of tampering was strikingly visible. The proposed adoption of ``tamper-evident'' terminology should remind all
parties that the success of these regulatory initiatives depends significantly on consumer vigilance. The proposed
rule would also revise &sect;211.132(c) to clarify the requirements for the tamper-evident packaging labeling
statement. By alerting consumers to the particular tamper-evident packaging features used, the labeling statement
plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of any tamper-evident packaging system. Consumers who are alerted and aware
of all packaging features used are in the best position to detect the evidence of tampering that the package has been
designed to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Current &sect;211.132(c) states that each retail package ``* * * is required to bear a statement that is prominently
placed so that consumers are alerted to the specific tamper-resistant feature of the package.'' Some firms have interpreted
this as requiring the labeling statement to refer only to tamper-evident features on the external package. Proposed
&sect;211.132(c) would clarify that, in order to alert consumers to the tamper-evident packaging features used,
the labeling statement must identify all packaging features used to comply with proposed &sect;211.132(b)(1),
including those on the secondary package, those on the immediate container or closure, and any capsule sealing technologies
that are employed to meet the requirements of proposed &sect;211.132(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also revise &sect;211.132(b) and (c) to remove reference to OTC products in aerosol containers,
which are inherently resistant to tampering, but not appropriately considered in a discussion of tamper-evident
packaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also amend &sect;211.132(a) and (b) to replace the term ``throat lozenge'' with ``lozenge.''
FDA is making this change because the tamper-evident packaging requirements should apply to all lozenges, not just
throat lozenges. The agency also notes that the proposed change is consistent with earlier tamper-resistant packaging
regulations (see 48 FR 16658 at 16664, April 19, 1983).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Legal Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is authorized in part by sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) concerning imposition
of requirements necessary to assure that drugs meet the requirements of the act for identity, strength, quality,
and purity. These requirements may be imposed as current good manufacturing practice under section 501(a)(2)(B)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)) and in aid of other statutory requirements relating to product safety and integrity.
(See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 351(b) and (c) and section 701 (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) of the act.) This statutory authorization permits
promulgation of requirements for container and package design that provide protection against intentional product
adulteration by means of tampering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Promulgating requirements for labeling statements alerting drug product consumers to tamper-evident features
is authorized under the adulteration provisions in section 501 and under the provisions in sections 502 and 201(n)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(c) and 321(n)). The labeling statements are necessary to assure the effectiveness of the
tamper-evident features; without such statements the products would be adulterated. In addition, under section
502(c) of the act, products are misbranded if statements required under other authority in the act are omitted from
the products' labeling. Moreover, under sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the act, products may be misbranded by reason
of the omission of material facts about the products, such as the tamper-evident features. (See 47 FR 50442 at 50447,
November 5, 1982, for additional discussion of the legal authority for requirements related to drug product tampering.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Consumer Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1991 tampering fatalities made clear that the OTC drug supply is still vulnerable to malicious tampering. As noted,
FDA's deliberations following these fatalities focused on reevaluating current strategies to reduce the likelihood
of harm from tampering and looking at the role that FDA, industry, and consumers play in their success or failure. While
the agency will consider whether additional changes to the regulations may be needed to reduce the risks posed by product
tampering, FDA believes that further initiatives will increasingly focus on consumer education and involvement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA has already taken steps to inform consumers about the need to be alert for drug product tampering. FDA has worked
closely with NDMA to develop and disseminate public service announcements about tampering. These are being provided
to general circulation magazines and other publications. In addition, the October 1991 issue of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA Consumer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contained an article entitled ``Look Twice,'' which explains the danger posed by drug product tampering and the need
for consumer vigilance. Similar information appears in materials cosponsored by FDA and NDMA including a brochure
called ``Buying Medicine?: Stop, Look, Look Again'' and a video and audio tape on product tampering entitled ``Take
A Look,'' which has been distributed to the media. FDA is also considering sponsoring workshops around the country
to inform the public about tamper-evident packaging and the safety of the OTC drug supply. FDA solicits comments and
suggestions from the public on ways to improve this educational campaign.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Research Into Consumer Behavior
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory strategies FDA has adopted have been based on certain assumptions about how consumers behave when
buying and taking their OTC drug products. To choose the most effective measures to enable consumers to detect tampering,
it is necessary to have more and better information about how consumers select, purchase, and use OTC drug products
and how tamper-evident packaging and associated labeling affects their behavior. FDA is aware of some research in
this area, including studies done at Michigan State University, Rutgers University, and other academic institutions.
Although such research has provided useful starting points for discussions of tamper-evident packaging, FDA believes
that further research is needed to permit the design of more effective packaging features and educational campaigns.
FDA is interested in learning more about any current consumer research that is relevant to the concerns of this rulemaking.
FDA is also willing to assist any industry group or other interested party in the design and development of research
in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Private Initiatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the agency has taken several steps to encourage the use of safer packaging technologies. FDA believes that
these steps can be complemented by actions of drug manufacturers and other interested persons. The agency initiatives
in 1982 were taken with the knowledge that certain packaging technologies, including, for example, film wrappers,
blister or strip packs, and heat shrink bands or wrappers, were available to drug manufacturers to reduce the risk
of tampering. The agency notes that few new technologies have been added since 1982. The agency recognizes that no
package is tamper-proof but believes that there are opportunities for innovations and for refinement of current
designs to improve consumer protection. FDA encourages both individual and collective efforts in the OTC drug and
packaging industry to devise better technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA would also like to discuss with the drug industry and other interested persons the possibility of establishing
performance standards for tamper-evident packaging. Such standards might be based on the probability that a consumer
could detect evidence of tampering with a given packaging design. Compliance with the standards might be measured
by studying the likelihood that a consumer would recognize signs of tampering within a specified amount of time. Where
a packaging feature is to be used on a product targeted to or frequently purchased by a particular group of consumers,
such as the elderly, the level of recognition might be determined using a representative number of the particular
group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Developing performance standards based, in part, on the behavior and reaction of consumers to product packaging
would be challenging. FDA believes, however, that it is not an impossible task, and suggests that information from
the research and development of package design from a marketing standpoint might be useful. Furthermore, the agency
believes that any performance standards for tamper-evident packaging should be based on the latest behavioral and
technological information available. Such state-of-the-art standards would give packaging engineers and manufacturers
a benchmark for evaluating particular package designs, and would provide an incentive to improve the effectiveness
of tamper-evident packaging to mirror technological progress in the field. The agency invites comments on the appropriateness
of developing and requiring performance standards for tamper-evident packaging.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has carefully considered the economic impact of this proposed rule and has determined that it requires neither
a regulatory impact analysis, as specified by Executive Order 12291, nor a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The agency believes that the proposed rule, if finalized,
would generate costs that are well below the thresholds that would signify a major rule, and so the proposed rule does
not require a regulatory impact analysis. The agency also finds that the proposed rule would not have a significant
effect on a substantial number of small entities, and therefore does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current FDA requirements for OTC drug packaging to protect the public from the threat of product tampering have been
in place since 1982. This proposed rule would not change the scope or applicability of these requirements, but would
only amend the requirements with regard to one OTC drug dosage form and impose a minor labeling change that would affect
certain products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule may impose additional costs on manufacturers who choose to market their OTC drug products in two-piece,
hard gelatin capsules instead of switching to a different dosage form, such as a soft-gel or liquid-gel capsule, or
a caplet. The proposed rule would delete the current requirement that two-piece, hard gelatin capsules be packaged
using two tamper-evident features, and would require instead that all such capsules be sealed and packaged using
at least one tamper-evident feature. FDA believes that capsule sealing would make it more difficult to tamper with
this dosage form without leaving visible evidence, and that any costs resulting from the rule would be small compared
to public health benefits from this added measure of consumer protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of two-piece, hard gelatin capsule OTC products sold over the last few years has declined dramatically,
with fewer than 50 such items currently listed with FDA. A review of those products indicates that from 75 percent to
90 percent are already sealed or ``banded.'' Thus, FDA is aware of only a small number of OTC products still marketed
as unsealed two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. Under the proposed rule, the few firms producing these products would
have to choose between incurring costs for reformulating the product to a different dosage form or installing machinery
needed to seal the two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. The affected firms would not face substantial added costs for
lost product inventory because the proposed rule allows manufacturers 1 year and retailers 2 years after the date
of publication of a final rule to effect the changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NDMA estimates that the approximate cost of a capsule sealing or banding machine ranges from $150,000 to $250,000.
Assuming FDA's higher bound estimate that only 25 percent of the 50 listed, two-piece, hard gelatin capsule products
are not currently sealed with an appropriate technology, then 12 products would need to be sealed or banded. If only
one new capsule banding machine were needed per product, the total cost to the industry would range from $1.8 million
to $3 million. An additional cost may occur if it is difficult for a company to integrate the sealing equipment into
its capsule filling line. According to NDMA, some companies may find that this problem adds an extra cost of approximately
50 cents to 80 cents per 1,000 capsules. Nonetheless, for all but the smallest product lines, these costs would be a
modest percentage of sales. The proposed rule would also change regulatory terminology from ``tamper-resistant''
packaging to ``tamper-evident'' packaging. This would affect a substantial number of firms because it would necessitate
a labeling change under &sect;211.132(c) for all OTC products that now have the words ``tamper-resistant'' on their
package. A small survey conducted by FDA found that approximately 60 percent of OTC drug product labels include the
words ``tamper-resistant.'' The remaining product labels include a description of tamper-resistant packaging
features, but do not specifically use the words ``tamper-resistant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In 1986, NDMA estimated that about 70 percent of their members' 435 products, excluding private labelers, were affected
by tamper-resistant packaging regulations. On the assumption that there were three shelf keeping units (SKU's)
per product, this amounted to about 1,300 SKU's. Based on a 1986 survey of its members, NDMA had reported that the average
labeling change cost per SKU was $3,000 to $4,000. The current proposal, however, would require a much simpler label
change than was considered in that 1986 survey. Nonetheless, if the cost per SKU were assumed to be about $3,000, the
total cost of changing 60 percent of these labels would be approximately $2.3 million (60 percent x 1,300 x $3,000).
In addition, NDMA provided a preliminary estimate of $5 million for 15 larger private labeling companies. Sixty percent
of this cost amounts to $3 million. Thus, the potential upper-bound cost imposed by the proposed labeling changes
may amount to $5 to $6 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual cost of the labeling change would be significantly lessened by FDA's proposed effective date for the labeling
change, which would give manufacturers up to 2 years from the date of publication of a final rule to make the required
changes. The agency chose this timeframe to minimize the burden to industry of converting to ``tamper-evident''
terminology, based on information from NDMA that most product labels are routinely reprinted within an 18- to 24-month
period. Thus, although FDA does not know the precise number of OTC product labels that are normally reprinted within
a 2-year period, the labeling costs attributable to the proposed regulation would be minimal for most firms in this
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To summarize, the total one-time costs of this proposed rule would be the sum of the approximately $3 million to seal
or band the remaining few two-piece, hard gelatin capsule products and the minimal costs needed to change the labeling
on the products that currently read ``tamper-resistant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In addition to these regulatory changes, FDA has invited comments on other initiatives such as the development of
better consumer education campaigns, research into consumer behavior with regard to OTC packaging and tamper-evident
packaging, and the possibility of developing performance standards for tamper-evident packaging. Any of these
programs, if adopted as regulatory requirements, could have significant economic importance. Before promulgating
any final regulation, however, FDA intends to consider all relevant information on the economic consequences of
these initiatives and reasonable alternatives. The agency solicits public comment on all aspects of both the costs
and feasibility of all issues raised by this proposal, especially with respect to any impact on affected small businesses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires that Federal agencies carefully examine regulatory actions to determine if they
would have significant federalism implications. FDA's tamper-resistant packaging regulations were issued with
the intent that the regulations preempt State and local packaging requirements that are not identical to the Federal
requirements in all respects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(47 FR 50442 at 50447, November 5, 1992). The agency believes that the proposed changes would improve safeguards to
protect consumers from tampering of all OTC drug products, particularly those marketed as two-piece, hard gelatin
capsules, and that the amendments, therefore, should eliminate the need for additional action at the State or local
level. FDA invites comments on the adequacy of the proposed amendments in this regard.

VII. Proposed Effective Dates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes that any final rule based on the proposed requirement that all OTC drug products marketed as two-piece,
hard gelatin capsules be sealed be made effective 1 year after its date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All OTC drug products marketed as two-piece, hard gelatin capsules that are initially introduced or initially delivered
for introduction into interstate commerce on or after the effective date must be sealed according to the requirements
of the final rule or be subject to regulatory action. FDA also proposes a retail level effective date for this requirement
of 2 years after the date of publication of a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After this date, all two-piece, hard gelatin capsule products held for sale (including stocks in retail stores)
must be sealed according to the requirements of the final rule or be subject to regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also proposes that any labeling changes necessary to reflect the adoption of ``tamper-evident'' terminology
be made within 2 years after the date of publication of a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on information from industry, FDA expects that most products subject to tamper-evident packaging requirements
will have undergone routine labeling revisions within this timeframe.

Requirements for tamper-evident package
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin,
or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this product is accessible
to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident package is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry
which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering
has occurred. To reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will
discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one
or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered
trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term ``distinctive by design'' means the packaging
cannot be duplicated with commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container
and closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to provide a visual
indication of package integrity. The tamper-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled
in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and retail display. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any two-piece,
hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an acceptable tamper-evident technology.

. (1) In order to alert consumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC drug
product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules or containers of compressed
medical oxygen) is required to bear a statement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Identifies all tamper-evident feature(s) and any capsule sealing technologies used to comply with paragraph
(b) of this section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is prominently placed on the package; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section uses an identifying
characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For example, the labeling
statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say ``For your protection, this bottle has an imprinted seal around the
neck.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 14, 1993 [58 FR 65295]. In Notice No. 785, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) proposed to
amend its regulations to liberalize the requirements for using a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label.
The current regulations provide that a wine may bear a multistate appellation of origin only where the wine is in conformance
with the laws and regulations governing the composition, method of manufacture, and designation of wines in all the
States listed in the appellation. The proposed amendment would provide an exception where State laws and regulations
do not authorize the use of a multistate appellation of origin which includes that State for wines sold within its boundaries.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 14, 1993, ATF published Notice No. 785, soliciting comments from the public and industry on a proposal
to amend 27 CFR 4.25a(d)(3) to make it more practical to use a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label. This
proposal was based on a petition by Stimson Lane Ltd., a company with wineries located in Washington and California.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF has received written requests from the Wine Institute and the American Vintners Association (AVA) for additional
time to review and analyze the issues raised in this rulemaking proceeding. Since the Wine Institute and AVA are directly
impacted by issues raised in Notice No. 785, ATF believes that reopening the comment period is justified. Therefore,
the comment period is being reopened until March 21, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule will amend 28 CFR part 68, which contains the rules of practice and procedure for administrative
hearings conducted to enforce sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''). Sections
274A and 274B were added to the INA by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (``IRCA''), and were amended by
title V of the Immigration Act of 1990 (``IMMACT''), which added section 274C to the INA. These amendments are necessary
to bring the practices and provisions established in part 68 into conformity with the provisions of the INA. Specifically,
these amendments will clarify the amount of time a party has to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals an Administrative
Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the INA require that hearings be held before Administrative Law Judges in cases involving
allegations that a person or other entity has:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Hired, or recruited or referred for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing that the alien is
unauthorized to work in the United States; or has so hired or referred or recruited for a fee, any individual when the
hiring person or entity fails to comply with the employment eligibility verification requirements (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Continued to employ an alien in the United States knowing that the alien is or has become unauthorized with respect
to such employment (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(2));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Imposed, in the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment of any individual, any requirement that the individual
post a bond or security, pay or agree to pay any amount, or otherwise guarantee or indemnify against any potential liability
under 8 U.S.C. 1324a for unlawful hiring, recruiting or referring of such individual (8 U.S.C. 1324a(g)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Engaged in unfair immigration-related employment practices (8 U.S.C. 1324b); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Knowingly participated in activities involving fraudulent creation or use of documents for the purposes of satisfying,
or complying with, a requirement of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 24, 1987, the Department of Justice published an interim final rule establishing administrative practices
and procedures to implement sections 274A and 274B of the INA. 52 FR 44972. After receiving comments, the Department
published the final rule on November 24, 1989. 54 FR 48593. That rule governed all cases properly brought before an
Administrative Law Judge that complied with the requirements of the INA. Then, on November 28, 1990, Congress enacted
the Immigration Act of 1990, which amended sections 274A and 274B of the INA, and added section 274C. These amendments
necessitated certain revisions to the practices and procedures established by part 68, which were set forth in an
interim rule with request for comments, published October 3, 1991. 56 FR 50049. After receiving comments, the Department
published the final rule on December 7, 1992. 57 FR 57669. The final rule, however, did not distinguish between the
time the Administrative Law Judge ``enters'' an order and the time an order is ``issued''. This distinction is critical
in clarifying the amount of time a party has to appeal an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section
274C proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals. Based upon experience gained by the Office of the Chief Administrative
Hearing Officer in implementing the hearing procedures and the statutory language regarding the Chief Administrative
Hearing Officer's review authority found at section 274A(e)(7), it is proposed that &sect;68.2 paragraph (i) be
revised to reflect the reference made to the definition of ``entry'' in the revised definition of ``issued'' at &sect;68.2(k),
and that &sect;68.2 paragraph (k) be amended to account for the thirty (30) days the Chief Administrative Hearing
Officer has to modify or vacate an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or 274C proceeding after the Administrative
Law Judge enters the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of
section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does it have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment
in accordance with section 6 of E.O. 12612. The Attorney General has certified to the Office of Management and Budget
that these final regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of E.O. 12778.

 The Department proposes to waive the rule at 34 CFR 75.261 in order to extend the project period under the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) Regional Centers Program from 48 months to 60 months. This action will allow services
under this program to continue uninterrupted, and will result in the awarding of 12-month continuation awards to
each of the five existing grantees, using fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Regional Centers Program is authorized by sections 5111(a)(1) and 5135 of the DFSCA, which is part of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Appropriations for the Regional Centers Program were authorized through September
30, 1993 by the DFSCA. Section 414 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) authorizes an automatic extension
of the DFSCA through FY 1994 (September 30, 1994). The Congress is considering reauthorization of the DFSCA, but final
action on the reauthorization is not expected until late in FY 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1990, the Department awarded cooperative agreements for five Regional Centers to provide training and technical
assistance services in drug education and prevention to State educational agencies, local educational agencies,
and institutions of higher education. The centers were each given a project period of 48 months, based on the project
period announced in the Friday, September 15, 1989, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Since FY 1990, these centers have been maintained through continuation awards in three subsequent fiscal years
(FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993). Each center has received approximately $3 million per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the automatic extension authorized under section 414 of GEPA, projects authorized under sections 5111(a)(1)
and 5135 of the DFSCA can be funded in FY 1994 as well. Any funding after FY 1994 would be dependent on future Congressional
action with no guarantee that projects funded under the current authorization could be supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a new competition under the existing legislation were held in FY 1994, the projects could only be funded for a limited
project period of 12 months. In the past, it has taken new centers up to a year to ``start up,'' given the scope and complexity
of the services they provide and the time it takes to hire qualified staff and develop plans and relationships that
are responsive to clients in their regions. The Assistant Secretary believes that starting new centers in FY 1994
for only 12 months would severely disrupt the quality and level of center services. Holding a competition in FY 1994
would impose considerable costs at the Federal level without a guarantee that the new centers would be able to provide
the technical assistance necessary to school districts as the Department moves to implement Goals 2000 and the new
ESEA.

Therefore, the Assistant Secretary proposes, in the best interests of the Federal Government, to extend the current
projects for one additional year with the Federal Government bearing the cost. This proposal is consistent with the
President's mandate to implement cost-effective, cost-saving initiatives. In order to make these cost extensions,
the Assistant Secretary must waive the regulation at 34 CFR 75.261, which permits extensions of projects only at no
cost to the Federal Government. In consideration of the foregoing, the Assistant Secretary proposes to waive 34 CFR
75.261 as applied to the DFSCA Regional Centers Program during FY 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is proposing new regulations under 17 U.S.C. 802(d), supplementing
and superseding the former Copyright Royalty Tribunal's rules and regulations which were adopted on December 22,
1993. 58 FR 67690 (1993). The Office is also proposing a course of action for dealing with rate adjustment and distribution
matters which were pending before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination. A meeting open to the public will be held
on February 1, 1994 at 10 a.m. to discuss all issues related to today's publication.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (``Reform Act'').
Public Law No. 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304. Effective immediately upon enactment, the Reform Act amends the Copyright
Act, 17 U.S.C., by eliminating the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and transferring its responsibilities and duties
to ad hoc Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs), to be administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright
Office. As directed by the new act, the Librarian of Congress will convene Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels for
the purpose of adjusting rates and distributing royalties. See 17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 116, 118, 119 and chapter 10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Immediately upon enactment of the Reform Act the Copyright Office issued a notice adopting the full text of the former
Tribunal's rules and regulations on an interim basis. 58 FR 67690 (1993). This action was required by new section 802(d)
of the Copyright Code, which provides:

Effective on the date of the enactment of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, the Librarian of Congress
shall adopt the rules and regulations set forth in chapter 3 of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations to govern
proceedings under this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall remain in effect unless and until the Librarian,
upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, adopts supplemental or superseding regulations under subchapter
II of chapter 5 of title 5.

17 U.S.C. 802(d). The Copyright Office made only slight technical changes to the former Tribunal's rules, stating
that it intended to review and revise the rules during the course of a future rulemaking. 58 FR at 67690 (1993). The Office
now commences that proceeding to conform the rules to the new system of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels.

II. Matters Pending Before the Former Tribunal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A major issue facing the Copyright Office of Library of Congress at the outset of today's proposed rulemaking is the
resolution of rate adjustments and distributions, and related matters, which were pending before the Copyright
Royalty Tribunal at the time of its demise. Some of these proceedings, such as distribution of 1990 cable royalties,
had already commenced hearings, while others were awaiting determination of controversies or rulings on procedural
issues. Since the Office is proposing new rules and regulations which will govern and shape rate adjustment and distribution
proceedings under the new system, the Office must first decide how to handle the Tribunal's old business.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office is of the firm opinion that it is not the successor agency or office to the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.
The Reform Act represents a radically different approach for adjusting rates and distributing royalties for the
copyright compulsory licenses, and is not an absorption of one agency by another. The Tribunal is replaced, not moved
or merged, by ad hoc Arbitration Panels which are to be administered by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress.
The Office is therefore not simply picking up where the Tribunal left off, but is responsible for administering a completely
new system of ratemaking and distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Copyright Office is not a successor agency, it is our preliminary finding that all proceedings pending
before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination were terminated at that time. In other words, the Office will not
continue to conduct and handle matters and proceedings which were before the Tribunal, but will require that all parties
which had pending business before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination must, if they desire the matter to receive
further consideration, file the matter anew before the Copyright Office. Thus, for example, the Librarian will not
automatically convene a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel to pick up where the proceedings left off for the 1990
cable distribution, but will require the parties who participated in that proceeding to refile their case with the
Office in accordance with the rules and regulations proposed below. While the Office understands that the parties
may be somewhat burdened by duplicating at least a portion of their case, it is necessary that the Office wipe the slate
clean and, for purposes of the operation of the proposed rules and administrative efficiency, begin anew the matters
pending before the former Tribunal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An issue related to the termination of proceedings pending before the former Tribunal and the requirement of new filings
is the legal effect of orders and decisions issued by the Tribunal during those proceedings. New section 802(c) of
the Copyright Act states that Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels ``shall act on the basis of *&blank;*&blank;*
prior decisions of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal *&blank;*&blank;*'', but does not bind the Panels to those decisions;
the effect of those decisions on the Librarian or the Copyright Office is not mentioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office has no intention of questioning or reopening matters decided by the former Tribunal with respect
to ongoing proceedings. However, we understand that the termination of pending Tribunal proceedings and the requirement
of new filings will likely raise again some of the issues previously decided by the Tribunal. The Copyright Office
of the Library of Congress makes a preliminary finding that, while we will look to the Tribunal's decisions and orders
for guidance, neither the Office nor the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels are legally bound by those decisions.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 All legal issues related to proceedings pending before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination may therefore be
resubmitted to the Copyright Office and, where appropriate, to the Arbitration Panels for consideration.

The Copyright Office acknowledges that it is of course bound by rate adjustments and distributions that the Tribunal
had conducted and concluded before its elimination. Thus, for example, the Office will not entertain any petitions
to reexamine cable distributions for years earlier than 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revising the former Tribunal's rules is a particularly complicated task, given the division of authority between
the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels and the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. Under the old law the
Tribunal acted as a single autonomous body; in contrast, the distribution of royalty fees or the setting of royalty
rates under the new legislation will often be a multistage process. For example, in order to adjust a compulsory license
royalty rate, the Librarian of Congress, with the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, must appoint an arbitration
panel and then review the panel's report and, with the Register's recommendation, either approve the report or substitute
his/her own judgment. This new system renders many of the former Tribunal's rules and regulations inappropriate,
and requires creation of a new framework to allocate responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the Library and the Copyright Office recognize the desirability of preserving as much continuity
as possible between the old and new systems.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rules are based upon and seek to track the structure and organization of the former Tribunal's rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for continuity is underscored by the Reform Act's instruction that the Tribunal's rules be fully adopted
upon enactment, to be later amended or superseded. See 17 U.S.C. 802(d).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Library and Copyright Office have thoroughly reviewed the entire body of the former Tribunal's rules and regulations
and considered the extent to which they fit with the new bifurcated system of ad hoc Arbitration Panels administered
by the Library and the Office. The results are today's proposed rules, which are intended to preserve the essential
elements of the Tribunal's system while taking into account the requirements and complexities presented by an independent
arbitration process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the outset a technical change is required by the regulations governing the Code of Federal Regulations itself;
the former Tribunal's rules are being moved from Chapter III to Chapter II of Title 37, CFR. Chapter III is repealed,
and Chapter II is restructured to accommodate the new body of regulations. Chapter II, which until now has contained
five individual parts (Parts 201&hyph;204 and 211), will be divided into two subchapters. Subchapter A will contain
the five original parts of Chapter II, and new Subchapter B will contain the entire body of the former Tribunal rules,
along with today's proposed changes. And future rule changes or additions bearing upon the Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panels will appear in subchapter 8 of Chapter II, 37 CFR.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The part numbers of the rules generally track the Tribunal's original structure (parts 301&hyph;311), and are redesignated
parts 251&hyph;259 of the Copyright Office's rules. Two parts of the Tribunal's former rules, parts 303 and 305 relating
to jukebox performances, are being repealed since their relevance has been eliminated by the Reform Act's repeal
of the jukebox compulsory license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main task of today's proposed rulemaking is to provide the substantive changes in the former Tribunal's rules
necessary to implement the Reform Act and to create a workable and efficient system for adjusting royalty rates and
distributing royalties. The following is a part-by-part summary of the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Part 251_Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels Rules of Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 251 is a proposed revision of part 301 of the former Tribunal's rules, which covered most of the Tribunal's operating
procedures and rules of practice. This is the part that is in greatest need of revision, since many of the rules are inappropriate
to govern the new system of ad hoc Arbitration Panels. The following summarizes the proposed changes in the various
subparts of part 251. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Subpart A_Organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A of part 251, entitled ``Organization'' and describing the composition of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal,
was rendered superfluous by the Reform Act. Since it is necessary to create a completely different organizational
scheme to implement the new system, we are planning to repeal all of subpart A and to substitute completely new provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Official Address.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Part 251.1 provides a single official address for all proceedings and actions conducted under subchapter B. Establishment
of an official address is important, since many sections of subchapter B refer to this section or require documents
to be filed at this address, including all royalty claims, requests for information, public access to documents,
payments of Arbitration Panel costs, and motions, objections, and records filed with the Panels. Moreover, since
all records submitted to the Copyright Office, to the Library, and to the CARPs are, with limited exceptions, available
to the public for inspection and copying, a single address is required to assure that all documents will be assembled
in a single location for the convenience of those wishing to inspect them. We also believe that providing a single permanent
repository for all documents created and submitted under subchapter B is not only important, but required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All this may seem self-evident, but there is a problem here. Unlike the proceedings of the Tribunal, arbitration proceedings
will not necessarily take place at a single location, within the Library of Congress or elsewhere. There may be incentive
in particular cases for parties to deliver filings directly to the actual location where the CARP is meeting, but we
believe it would be a mistake to allow entire filings to go to locations different from the mailing address specified
in these proposed regulations. Any possible advantages of such a system to the parties or the Panels would be outweighed
by the dangers of confusion among parties to different proceedings and possible uncertainties and difficulties
in mail receipt and delivery. Since individuals' rights often depend on the timely filing and delivery of papers,
the guarantee of proper handling can only be afforded by delivery to a single address in the Copyright Office of the
Library of Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, while section 251.1 creates a single official address, section 251.44 provides the parties flexibility
in submitting documents and filing papers. In cases where an Arbitration Panel is conducting a hearing, the arbitrators
are directed to establish requirements permitting delivery of filings directly to them, as long as one copy of the
filing is delivered to the Copyright Office at its official address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of the CARPs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 251.2 describes the purpose of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels: to make rate adjustments and/or
royalty distributions for the cable (17 U.S.C. 111), mechanical (17 U.S.C. 115), jukebox (17 U.S.C. 116), public
broadcasting (17 U.S.C. 118), satellite carrier (17 U.S.C. 119) and digital audio recording devices and media (17
U.S.C. chapter 10) licenses. The jurisdiction of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels is more limited than that
of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal which, for example, had authority to adjust the royalty maximum for digital audio
recording devices. This adjustment is now the province of the Librarian. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 17 U.S.C. 1004(a)(3). There are also certain arbitration procedures in the Copyright Act which are not within the
jurisdiction of the CARPs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
List of Arbitrators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Reform Act provides that the selection of arbitrators for a Royalty Panel must be made from ``lists provided by
professional arbitration associations.'' 17 U.S.C. 802(b). Sections 251.3 and 251.4 govern the creation and use
of those lists. Before the beginning of each year (and, in the case of the current year of 1994, before March 1), any professional
arbitration association or organization may submit a list of its member arbitrators who would be qualified to serve
on a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Specific information is required with respect to each person whose name
is submitted, including current and past employment, educational background, and a description of the facts and
information that would qualify the person to serve as an arbitrator. After receiving the lists, there will be an initial
screening process in which the Librarian will determine: 1) if the proposed person meets the necessary qualifications
to serve as an arbitrator; and 2) if that person can reasonably be expected to be available during that calendar year.
The names of persons meeting the requirements will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at the beginning of each year (in the case of 1994, by March 1), and this publication will serve as the master list from
which the Librarian can select names for any arbitration proceeding commencing in that calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Objection Procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Librarian will screen the master list, and there is also a procedure for objection. The objection procedure is
confined to the period before an individual arbitration proceeding begins, and is limited to the parties participating
in that proceeding. In the case of rate adjustment proceedings, parties may file their objections during the 90-day
``cooling off'' period following the filing of petitions for adjustment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &sect;251.63. In the case of distribution proceedings, objections must be filed during the precontroversy discovery
period specified by &sect;251.45(a). Objections must clearly spell out the facts and reasons for disqualification
of persons on the arbitrator list, and the Librarian will consider them during the selection process for the first
two arbitrators. Once the Librarian has made his selections, the objections will be made available to the two arbitrators
to assist them in their selection of the third arbitrator. No peremptory objections will be allowed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifications of the Arbitrators. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.5 describes the qualifications a person must have to serve as an arbitrator. We have deliberately avoided
adopting an extensive and specific list of qualifications on the theory that the results of a long, overly-particularized
list of qualifications would likely result in a homogeneous Panel, and that the Librarian should be able to choose
from persons of diverse backgrounds and skills. The Reform Act requires that an arbitrator have experience in conducting
arbitration proceedings, and experience in settling disputes. The only two qualifications the Office has added
are membership in a bar association and ten or more years of legal practice. Since the arbitration process contemplated
by the Reform Act often resembles an adjudicatory procedure more than a traditional arbitration, the Office felt
that it was necessary for arbitrators to be lawyers with a fair amount of experience as practitioners. The area of practice
is not specified; we believe that a background in copyright, though helpful, is not necessarily indispensable to
serving as an arbitrator. Keeping the number of qualifications to a minimum should produce a diversified group of
individuals to serve as arbitrators with the necessary legal training and experience to accomplish the task efficiently
and effectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection Process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.6 describes the selection process for an arbitration panel, restating the process described in the Reform
Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17 U.S.C. 802(b). The section requires the chairperson to act according to the majority wishes of the panel. There
is also a provision regarding substitution of arbitrators who, after selection, for some reason become unable to
continue service. In that event, the Librarian is directed to select a replacement promptly unless hearings have
already begun in the proceeding. If hearings have begun, the remaining arbitrators or arbitrator would constitute
the quorum necessary to render a determination.

Division of Authority between Librarian and CARP. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.7 underscores the division of authority between the Librarian and the Royalty Panels. The Panels are
limited by the statute to making determinations in individual and separate proceedings necessary to settling a controversy
over royalty rates or distributions. Although given authority to issue orders governing the conduct of the proceedings,
the Panels do not have rulemaking authority to amend or otherwise alter these rules and regulations when they are issued
in final form.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, since the Panels are not independent agencies, they have no authority to publish materials in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because the Panels are considered a part of the Copyright Office and the Library of Congress, any orders and rulings
of the Panels that are to be published must be issued under the auspices of the Office and the Library.

Section 251.42 allows an individual Panel to waive or suspend the rules of subchapter B for purposes of the proceeding.
In the cases where Subchapter B does not prescribe a rule governing a particular question, the Panel, in accordance
with 17 U.S.C. 802(c), may adopt its own rule for purposes of that proceeding. This provision is designed to give a Panel
some flexibility in executing its duties with respect to the facts of its case. It is not, however, a grant of rulemaking
authority, and any waiver, suspension or adoption of a rule has effect only on the course of that proceeding and in no
way affects the rules and regulations of this subchapter or their application to other proceedings. It is expected
that each Panel will follow these rules and apply them in a way that produces a just and equitable proceeding.

2. Subpart B_Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law No. 94&hyph;409, 90 Stat. 1241, does not apply to Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panels, since CARPs are not an ``agency or agencies,'' the Copyright Office believes that the
provisions of the Act should apply to the conduct of meetings held by the arbitrators. This Subpart, therefore, tracks
the procedures governing open and closed meetings which the former Tribunal adopted and followed with only a few changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 251.11 states that all meetings of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel shall be open to the public unless
otherwise specified. Notice of the anticipated schedule of the hearings will be placed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least 7 days before the meeting. As amendments to the schedule are made, every practicable effort will be made to
keep the public informed. Section 251.12 provides for public and media access to open meetings, adopting the former
Tribunal's rules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

in toto.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sections 251.13 to 152.16 prescribe the procedures to be followed in closed meetings, adopting virtually all of the
former Tribunal's rules. Section 251.13 drops the requirement of closed meetings for internal personnel matters,
since the Panels are without authority to hire or maintain personnel, but it adds to the discretion of the Panel to go
into closed session to deliberate on a motion or objection raised orally at hearing. Section 251.16 directs that transcripts
of closed meetings shall be kept at the Copyright Office, which is the official address for all arbitration proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Subpart 3_Public Access to and Inspection of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As in subpart B, the copyright Office is proposing in subpart C to adopt the former Tribunal's rules with respect to
public access to and inspection of records, but with some important changes. The range of documents available to the
public is expanded. Section 251.21 provides that, with limited exceptions, all records of the Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panels, and also those of the Librarian of Congress assembled and/or created under 17 U.S.C. 801 and 802, are
available for public inspection and copying. Thus, for example, rulings or decisions of the Librarian made before
the convening of an Arbitration Panel would be publicly available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same difficulties raised by adoption of a single official address, as discussed above, also arise with respect
to the location of documents. While all filings with a CARP required by the proposed rules must be submitted through
the Copyright Office, certain documents other than filings may, during the course of a proceeding, be in the sole possession
of a Panel. Example are a document admitted into evidence during the course of a hearing to impeach the testimony of
a witness, or the transcript of an ongoing proceeding. Section 251.22 therefore specifies that all documents and
records in the sole possession of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel and not required to be filed with the Copyright
Office may be maintained by the chairperson at the location of the hearing, or at a location specified by the Panel.
All requests for access, however, must be directed to the Copyright Office, and not the Arbitration Panel. In the case
of documents solely in the possession of the Panel, the Copyright Office shall made arrangements to allow the person
making the request to inspect and copy them. The schedule of fees for services of this sort are those currently charged
by the Copyright Office for like services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Copyright Office already has its own Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act guidelines, see 37 CFR
parts 203 and 204, it is not adopting the former Tribunal regulations related to those Acts. The Office acknowledges
that some adjustments to those rules may be required by the peculiarities of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
system, but we believe there should be some practical experience before we identify any necessary changes.

4. Subpart D_Standards of Conduct
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Office is not proposing any regulations at this time, but as part of this proceeding we are inquiring as to standards
of conduct that should apply to the arbitrators.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
The Copyright Office is proposing to repeal subpart D, as it appeared in the former Tribunal's rules, and replace it
with rules governing standards of conduct for arbitrators. Former subpart D contained Equal Employment Opportunity
provisions for the Tribunal, which are no longer relevant for CARPs since they are without authority to hire personnel
or maintain a staff.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
5. Subpart E_Procedures of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As with so many of the rules of this subchapter, the new bifurcated system of the Reform Act requires some changes in
the former Tribunal's rules governing the conduct of proceedings. Nevertheless, although consequential adjustments
are needed, we believe that the over-all system of procedures long used by the Tribunal in rate adjustment and distribution
proceedings have served the public interest well and should be preserved. Maintaining the Tribunal's system to the
extent possible should reduce the learning process for parties that have appeared before the former Tribunal for
many years and should also, we hope, avoid some confusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of CARPs Procedures and Practice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the most part the hearing procedures and motions practice applicable to the CARPs are carried over from those of
the former Tribunal. Section 251.40 specifies that the procedural rules of this subpart E apply only to the Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panels and not to the actions of the Librarian or the Copyright Office, unless otherwise expressly
provided in this subpart. The section also states that subpart E only applies to CARPs, and not to other arbitration
proceedings under the Copyright Code. The Office is not statutorily required to apply these rules to other arbitration
proceedings. Although it is possible that some or all of these rules may ultimately be adopted for other arbitration
purposes; the statement clarifies the issue as of now and grants the Office flexibility in making future decisions
on the point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Formal Hearings and Other CARP Proceedings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 251.41 direct the Panels to conduct formal hearings for rate adjustment and royalty distribution proceedings.
All parties intending to participate in a hearing must file a notice of their intention to do so. The Panels are also
allowed to conduct other proceedings in the exercise of their basic functions, subject to section 251.7. For example,
in the course of a distribution controversy, a legal issue may arise which requires resolution before the proper distribution
can be determined. The Panel could conduct a proceeding to resolve that issue, which would be part of its function in
determining the distribution. It may also happen that resolution of the legal question will permit the parties to
the proceeding to settle their differences, thereby avoiding the need for a Panel distribution determination. The
Panel, however, is still subject to section 251.7, and could not conduct a rulemaking proceeding affecting any provisions
of subpart E. Section 251.41 also recognizes that, in the interest of reducing the expense of litigation, some parties
may wish to have their royalty entitlement or rate determined solely by written submissions, and a procedure for petitioning
the Librarian to have a ``paper'' proceeding is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Suspension or Waiver of Rules; Ad Hoc Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, although it is clear that the Arbitration Panels have no rulemaking authority, section 251.42 authorizes
them to waive or suspend the rules of subpart E for purposes of a particular proceeding. This carries on a practice formerly
used by the Tribunal, and allows the Panels flexibility in addressing the specific conditions and circumstances
of each proceeding; if the Panels were not allowed this flexibility, the resulting procedural rigidity could produce
injustices. In cases where subpart E is silent as to the correct procedure to be observed, the Panel may follow its own
procedures, as long as they are consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. However, as with suspension or
waiver, the ad hoc procedures adopted by that Panel apply only to that particular proceeding and that particular Panel.

Institution of Proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was the case with the former Tribunal, proceedings before a Panel begin with the filing of the written direct case.
Section 251.43 specifies that the written direct case must include all testimony and exhibits, complete with proper
referencing. Each party submitting a written direct case must specify its requested royalty rate or percentage of
the royalty pool, whichever is applicable. No evidence may be submitted in the direct written case without a sponsoring
witness or official notice, unless good cause is shown. Section 251.43 also gives Copyright Arbitration Royalty
Panels discretion in setting the time for the filing of written rebuttal cases after the conclusion of the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Filing and Service of Written Cases and Pleadings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.44 governs the filing and service of written cases and pleadings. The division of authority, together
with the possible differences in the location of the Copyright Office and the places where the CARPs hold their hearings,
require special filing and service requirements. The former Tribunal could maintain all records and evidence at
one location, but this is not possible under the new system. Section 251.44(a), therefore, requires that an original
and three copies of all filings made to a Panel be submitted in such manner as the Panel shall direct. As was discussed
above in connection with the official mailing address, location of arbitration proceedings is likely to change,
and the circumstances surrounding mail delivery and receipt could be uncertain. Section 251.44(a) allows the Panels
flexibility to deal with this problem by allowing them to establish the means of delivery, whether it be by direct hand
delivery, delivery to a specified address, or establishment of a temporary post office box. The parties submitting
filings, however, are still required to deliver one copy of their pleading or filing to the Copyright Office at its

copy must nonetheless be submitted to the Copyright Office.

Section 251.44(b) prescribes the requirements with respect to all filings with the Librarian of Congress_that is
motions and pleadings filed with the Librarian in accordance with these proposed rules both before and after the CARP
proceedings. Under the proposed rule, each party must file an original and five copies with the Copyright Office.
Section 251.44 also maintains the English-language translation, affidavit, subscription and verification, and
service requirements of the former Tribunal.

Precontroversy Discovery. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.45 significantly expands the scope of permitted discovery in arbitration proceedings. In his statement
accompanying H.R. 2840. Representative William Hughes, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property
and Judicial Administration of the House Committee on the Judiciary, commented favorably on the use of precontroversy
discovery and exchange of information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
139 Cong. Rec. H10973 (daily ed. Nov. 22, 1993) (``In order to reduce the amount of actual litigation time, and thereby
reduce expenses, I encourage the Librarian to promulgate regulations permitting exchange of information before
the tolling of the 180-day decision period, and, to the extent practicable, generally to permit precontroversy discovery.'').
Section 251.45 is proposed to explore the efficacy of Chairman Hughes' recommendation. We particularly seek comments
on the scope of such precontroversy discovery: whether it should include interrogatories of witnesses as well as
production of supporting documents, and whether it would advance Chairman Hughes' goal of reducing costs by being
able to stipulate facts and remove issues, or whether the additional procedures might add costs to the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of royalty distribution proceedings, the proposed rule directs the Librarian to designate a period for
precontroversy discovery and exchange of documents. This period is to start after the filing of claims and to end at
the declaration of a controversy, and is the same time period referred to by section 251.4(b) for the filing of objections
to arbitrators. In the case of rate adjustment proceedings, the period for precontroversy discovery and exchange
of documents corresponds with the 90-day consideration period for all rate adjustment petitions and proceedings
specified by &sect;251.63.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All parties to a proceeding may voluntarily exchange documents during this time, or may make discovery requests.
Failure to respond to requests, and any other discovery controversies or issues, will be resolved by the Librarian.
All other objections to royalty claims or petitions, or motions for procedural or evidentiary rulings, shall also
be submitted to the Librarian for decision during the same time period. All parties to the proceeding will be given
14 days in which to respond to a motion or objection, regardless of whether or not this 14-day period goes beyond the
time periods specified in subsection (a). The Librarian, after consultation with the Register, shall rule on all
motions or objections timely submitted, and will not declare a controversy and initiate arbitration proceedings
until all rulings have been made. See 17 U.S.C. 801(c).

Discovery and Motions during Proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.45(c) prescribes a similar procedure for exchanging documents and motions and objections filed with
a Panel once a proceeding beings. The Panel must designate a period for discovery with respect to both the written direct
and rebuttal cases. No time limits are set on the length of the discovery periods_although, given the Panel's 180-day
existence, the deadline will necessarily be short.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the filing of written cases, either direct or rebuttal, any party may file objections. If an objection is apparent
on the face of the written case, it must be raised or may thereafter be considered waived. Section 251.45(d) allows
each party whose claim, petition, written case or direct evidence is the subject of an objection, either before the
Librarian or a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, to amend its filing to respond to the objection. The Librarian
or the Panel may also request that such amended filing be made where necessary. All parties will be given a reasonable
period of time to conduct discovery on the amended filing.

Sections 251.46 through 251.48 are adopted nearly intact from the former Tribunal's rules. Section 251.46 describes
the role of the arbitrators and the chairperson during the course of a hearing. Section 251.47 describes the course

Section 251.49 governs transcription of the hearings and creation of the record. The Librarian shall, from time to
time, designate an official reporter to transcribe the hearings of any arbitration proceedings taking place during
that time. Since arbitration proceedings are likely to take place in different locations, the location of the transcript
will not always be at a fixed site. Therefore, the chairperson is directed to specify the location of the transcript
for public inspection. It is anticipated that the location will usually correspond to that of the hearing, although
this may not always be the case. Once the arbitration proceeding is concluded, the transcript, along with the full
written record, will be delivered to the Librarian and may be viewed at the Copyright Office.

Section 251.53 essentially codifies the provisions of 17 U.S.C. 802(e) governing the report of Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panels to the Librarian of Congress. The determination of a Panel is to be certified and signed by all the arbitrators,
and any written dissent is to be certified and signed by the dissenting arbitrator. Panels must distribute copies
of their determination to all participating parties.

as provided in the statement, and must be made either by money order, check, or bank draft. Failure to submit timely

After the arbitration process has concluded and the Panel has delivered its report, the Reform Act requires that the
Librarian of Congress review the sufficiency of the Panel's determination within 60 days of receipt of the report.
Section 251.55 grants the parties to the proceeding 14 days in which to file petitions with the Librarian requesting
that the determination be modified or set aside, and an additional 14 days to reply to such petitions. The petitioner
must clearly state its reasons for the modification or reversal, and include applicable portions of its proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law. After the four-week period has run, the Librarian will proceed to a decision
on the Panel's report. Section 251.56 essentially codifies the review process described in 17 U.S.C. 802(f), with
the Librarian publishing the order of his/her decision in the Federal Register and delivering it to all the parties
to the proceeding. The order is to be effective 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register, unless an appeal
is taken (&sect;251.57). The appeals process described in &sect;251.58 comes directly from 17 U.S.C. 802(g).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic procedural mechanics of an arbitration proceeding are described in Subpart E, but the different nature

 Section 251.60 describes the scope of Subpart F, emphasizing that it applies only to rate adjustment proceedings
and that it augments the rules of Subpart E. In circumstances where one or more provisions of Subpart E and F are inconsistent,
section 251.60 makes clear that Subpart F is controlling.

Commencement of Proceedings; Content of Petitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.61 describes the commencement of adjustment proceedings for the applicable compulsory licenses. Adjustment
is either automatic, as in the case of non-commercial broadcasting, or by petition, as in the cases of cable, phonorecords,
jukeboxes, and audio home recording devices and media. The section implements the changes made by the Reform Act with
respect to the dates when proceedings begin or when petitions may be filed. Thus, cable rate adjustment petitions
may be filed in 1995 and every 5 years thereafter; those for phonorecords in 1997 and every 10 years thereafter; those
for jukeboxes within one year of termination or expiration of a negotiated license; and those for audio home recording
devices and media from October 29, 1997 to October 28, 1998 and not more than once a year thereafter. In the case of noncommercial
educational broadcasting, the Librarian will publish notice of initiation of arbitration proceedings on June 30,
1997, and every 5 years thereafter. Section 251.62 adopts the former Tribunal's rules governing the content of a petition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Period for Consideration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.63 is an important provision. Although it adopts the 90-day ``cooling off'' period used by the Tribunal
to facilitate settlements after the filing of a petition, or prior to a non-commercial educational broadcasting
rate adjustment, the 90-day period is significant for other purposes. This same 90-day period is used to conduct precontroversy
discovery and exchange of documents (&sect;251.45), and to file objections to names on the arbitrator list (&sect;251.4).
The Librarian will designate the 90-day period for consideration by publishing notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the expiration of the 90-day period, and after the Librarian has resolved all motions submitted during that
period, section 251.64 prescribes that the Librarian will determine the sufficiency of the rate adjustment petition.
If the petition is sufficient, the Librarian will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a declaration of a controversy and, at the same time, a notice of initiation of an arbitration proceeding. The same
declaration and notice of initiation shall be done for noncommercial educational broadcasting in accordance with
17 U.S.C. 118(b) and (c). The declaration and notice of initiation will commence the 180-day period for proceedings
described in 17 U.S.C. 802.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final section of Subpart F, &sect;251.65, implements section 802(h)(1) of the Copyright Act which allows the
Copyright Office and the Library to assess their reasonable costs for the rate adjustment proceeding directly to
the participating parties. These costs include any administrative services provided under U.S.C. 801(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart G is like Subpart F in that it prescribes additional procedural requirements inherent in certain royalty
distribution proceedings. There are three compulsory licenses that require royalty-fee distributions: cable,
satellite and digital audio. Section 251.70 states that the provisions of Subpart G apply to these licenses, and underscores
that, in the case of inconsistencies, Subpart G takes precedence over Subpart E.

<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of cable, claims must be filed during the month of July; for satellite during July; and for digital audio
during January and February. Under section 251.72, after the filing of claims as prescribed by 17 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;111(d)(4)(B)
(cable). 119(b)(4)(B) (satellite carrier), and 1007(b) (digital audio), the Librarian must determine whether
a controversy exists. The Librarian may issue requests for information or conduct hearings to assist in determining
the existence of a controversy, with notice of the proceedings to be published in the

Section &sect;251.74 is the royalty-distribution counterpart of &sect;251.65; it allows the Library and the Copyright

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 252 prescribes the filing requirements for claims to cable royalties. The Part significantly revises the former
Tribunal's rules governing the filing of cable claims by implementing a procedural system similar to that adopted
by the Tribunal for the filing of digital audio claims. See 58 FR 53822 (1993). Section 252.1 defines the scope of Part
252.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time of Filing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 252.2 specifies the time of filing for cable claims. Claims for cable royalties from the preceding calendar
year must be filed during the month of July, and no distribution will be made to any party failing to make a timely filing.
Cable claims may be filed jointly or singly as the submitting parties choose.

Content of Claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 252.3 describes the required content of a claim, and is more detailed than the former Tribunal's requirements.
The Copyright Office is not yet prepared to issue claimant forms, and each claimant must therefore take care to insure
that information meeting all the requirements of section 252.3 is contained in each claim. Each claim must state the
full legal name of the claimant, and its address, telephone number and facsimile number, if any. The claimant must
also identify at least one of its copyrighted works that was subject to a secondary transmission by a cable system in
the previous calendar year, thereby establishing a basis for a claim to royalties. If the claim is a joint claim, there
must be a concise statement of the authorization for filing the joint claim. For this purpose, performing rights societies
will not be required to obtain separate authorizations from their individual members beyond their standard agreements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All claims must be signed by the claimant or a duly authorized representative, and the Copyright Office must be notified
of name and/or address changes within 30 days of the change. Failure to notify the Office in a timely fashion is grounds
for dismissal of the claim. If a party submitting an individual claim wishes to change it to a joint claim, the Office
must be notified within 14 days of the agreement to submit a joint claim. All joint claimants must make available to
the Copyright Office and, if applicable, to a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel_a list of all individual claimants
covered by the joint claim.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance With Statutory Dates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 252.4 underscores the importance of complying with the July filing period. A claim is considered timely filed
if it is received by the Copyright Office during normal business hours in July, or is properly addressed to the Copyright
Office with correct postage and bears a July U.S. postmark. Claims dated only with a business meter and not received
in July are untimely. Absolutely no claim will be accepted if it is filed by facsimile transmission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proof of Fixation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, section 252.5 clarifies that the Copyright Office will not require claimants to file copies of their works.
In the event that the issue of fixation arises, the CARP conducting the proceeding will resolve the controversy on
the basis of affidavits and other appropriate documentary evidence. No affidavits need be submitted, however, unless
requested by the Panel.

C. Parts 253&hyph;256
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parts 253 through 256 adopt, with only minor technical changes, the provisions of the former Tribunal's regulations
for use of copyrighted works by noncommercial educational broadcasters, adjustment of royalty rates for phonorecord
players (jukeboxes), adjustment of royalty rates for making and distributing phonorecords, and adjustment of royalty
rates for the cable compulsory license. These actions contain current royalty rates, as adopted by the Tribunal,
and will be amended by the Copyright Office in the future as new rates are set by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
or the Librarian of Congress, as the case may be.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In adopting Parts 253&hyph;256, several regulations of the former Tribunal are being repealed. Former Part 303,
entitled ``Access to Phonorecord Players (Jukeboxes)'' is repealed, as is former Part 305, ``Claims to Phonorecord
Player (Jukebox) Royalty Fees.'' The need for these parts was eliminated by the Reform Act's repeal of the section
116 jukebox compulsory license and replacement with section 116A governing negotiated licenses. The need for former
Tribunal Part 306, however, was not eliminated since it contains royalty rates applicable to periods dating back
to January 1, 1982. These rates must be preserved, even though the compulsory license has now been eliminated for future
years, in the event that parties making use of copyrighted works during the periods covered by the license may now,
or in the future, make initial or supplementary payments. Part 254 therefore adopts Part 306 of the former Tribunal's
rules, with only one minor technical change.

D. Part 257_Filing of Claims to Satellite Carrier Royalty Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 257 implements exactly the same requirements for 17 U.S.C. 119 satellite carrier royalty claims that Part 252
adopts for cable claims. Like those for cable, claims in these cases must be filed during the month of July, and may be
filed singly or jointly. Section 257.6 makes it clear that, although cable and satellite have the same filing period,
separate claims must be filed by a party seeking both cable and satellite royalty fees for the same calendar year. Any
single claim which attempts to file for both royalty funds will be dismissed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parts 258 and 259 govern the adjustment of royalty fees for the satellite carrier compulsory license and the filing
of digital audio claims, respectively. These two parts adopt Parts 310 and 311 of the former Tribunal's rules with
only minor technical changes.

Procedure for closed meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Meetings may be closed, or information withheld from the public, only by a recorded vote of a majority of arbitrators
of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Each question, either to close a meeting or to withhold information, must
be voted on separately, unless a series of meetings is involved, in which case the Panel may vote to keep the discussions
closed for 30 days, starting from the first meetings. If the panel feels that information about a closed meeting must
be withheld, the decision to do so must also be the subject of a recorded vote.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Before a discussion to close a meeting or withhold information, the chairperson of a CARP must certify that such
an action is permissible, and the chairperson shall cite the appropriate exemption under &sect;251.13. This certification
shall be included in the announcement of the meeting and be maintained as part of the record of proceedings of the Panel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Following such a vote, the following information shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Such transcripts or minutes shall be kept by the Copyright Office for at least 2 years, or for at least 1 year after
the conclusion of the proceedings, whichever is later. Any portion of transcripts of meetings which the chairperson
of a CARP does not feel is exempt from disclosure under &sect;251.13 will ordinarily be available to the public within
20 working days of the meeting. Transcripts or minutes of closed meetings will be reviewed by the chairperson at the
end of the proceedings of the Panel and, if at that time he or she determines that they should be disclosed, he or she will
resubmit the question to the Panel to gain authorization for their disclosure.

This subpart governs the proceedings of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels for the adjustment of royalty rates
and distribution of royalty fees convened under 17 U.S.C. 803. This subpart does not apply to other arbitration proceedings
specified by 17 U.S.C., or to actions or rulemakings of the Librarian of Congress or the Register of Copyrights, except

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The formal hearings that will be conducted under the rules of this subpart are rate adjustment hearings and royalty
fee distribution hearings. All parties intending to participate in a hearing of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty
Panel must file a notice of their intention. A CARP may also, on its own motion or on the petition of an interested party,
hold other proceedings it considers necessary to the exercise of its functions, subject to the provisions of &sect;251.7.
All such proceedings will be governed by the rules of this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) During the time periods provided in &sect;251.45(a) and &sect;251.63, any party to the proceeding may petition
the Librarian of Congress to have the determination of the controversy rendered strictly on the submission of written
pleadings. Replies to such petitions may be filed within 14 days. The Librarian, upon recommendation of the Register
of Copyright, shall rule on the petition prior to the declaration of a controversy and initiation of a proceeding.

For purposes of an individual proceeding, the provisions of this subpart may be suspended or waived, in whole or in
part, by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel upon a showing of good cause, subject to the provisions of &sect;251.7.
Such suspension or waiver shall apply only to the proceeding of the CARP taking that action, and shall not be binding
on any other Panel or proceeding. Where procedures have not been specifically prescribed in this subpart, and subject
to &sect;251.7, the Panel shall follow procedures consistent with 5 U.S.C. chapter 5, subchapter II.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The proceedings of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel for rate adjustment, royalty fee distribution, or arbitration
conducted under 17 U.S.C. 1010 shall begin with the filing of written direct cases of the parties who have filed a notice
of intent to participate in the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The written direct case shall include all testimony, including each witness's background and qualifications,
along with all the exhibits to be presented in the direct case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each party may designate a portion of past records, including records of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal, that
it wants included in its direct case. Complete testimony of each witness whose testimony is designated (i.e., direct,
cross and redirect) must be referenced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) In the case of a royalty fee distribution proceeding, each party must state in the written direct case its percentage
or dollar claim to the fund. In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, each part must state its requested rate. No
party will be precluded from revising its claim or its requested rate at any time during the proceeding up to the filing
of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (e) No evidence, including exhibits, may be submitted in the written direct case without a sponsoring witness, except
where the Panel has taken official notice, or in the case of incorporation by reference of past records, or for good
cause shown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (f) Written rebuttal cases of the parties shall be filed at a time designated by a CARP upon conclusion of the hearing
of the direct case in the same form and manner as the direct case, except that the claim or the requested rate shall not
have to be included if it has not changed from the direct case.

of the Register of Copyrights, shall rule on the motion or objection prior to the declaration of a controversy and initiation
of an arbitration proceeding.

(2) After the filing of the written cases, any party may file with a CARP objections to any portion of another party's
written case on any proper ground including, without limitation, relevance, competency, and failure to provide
underlying documents. If an objection is apparent from the face of a written case, that objection must be raised or
the party may thereafter be precluded from raising such an objection.

(a) At the opening of a hearing conducted by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, the chairperson shall announce
the subject under consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Only the arbitrators of a CARP, or counsel as provided in this chapter, shall question witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Subject to the vote of the CARP, the chairperson shall have responsibility for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Setting the order of presentation of evidence and appearance of witnesses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Administering oaths and affirmations to all witnesses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Announcing the Panel's ruling on objections and motions and all rulings with respect to introducing or excluding
documentary or other evidence. In all cases, whether there are an even or odd number of arbitrators sitting at the hearing,
it takes a majority vote to grant a motion or sustain an objection. A split vote will result in the denial of the motion
or the overruling of the objection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Regulating the course of the proceedings and the decorum of the parties and their counsel, and insuring that the
proceedings are fair and impartial; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Announcing the schedule of subsequent hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each arbitrator may examine any witness or call upon any party for the production of additional evidence at any
time. Further examination, cross-examination, or redirect examination by counsel relevant to the inquiry initiated
by an arbitrator may be allowed by a Panel, but only to the limited extent that it is directly responsive to the inquiry
of the arbitrator.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Witnesses shall first be examined by their attorney and by opposing attorneys for their competency to support
their written testimony and exhibits (voir dire).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Witnesses may then summarize, highlight or read their testimony. However, witnesses may not materially supplement
or alter their written testimony except to correct it, unless the Panel expands the witness' testimony to complete
the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Parties are entitled to raise objections to evidence on any proper ground during the course of the hearing, including
an objection that an opposing party has not furnished nonprivileged underlying documents. However, they may not
raise objections that were apparent from the face of a written case and could have been raised before the hearing without
leave from the Panel. See &sect;251.45(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) All written testimony and exhibits will be received into the record, except any to which the Panel sustains an objection;
no separate motion will be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) If the Panel rejects or excludes testimony and an offer of proof is made, the offer of proof shall consist of a statement
of the substance of the evidence which it is contended would have been adduced. In the case of documentary or written
evidence, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of proof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Panel shall discourage the presentation of cumulative evidence, and may limit the number of witnesses that
may be heard on behalf of any one party on any one issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Parties are entitled to conduct cross-examination and redirect examination. Cross-examination is limited
to matters raised on direct examination. Redirect examination is limited to matters raised on cross-examination.
The Panel, however, may limit cross-examination and redirect examination if in its judgment this evidence or examination
would be cumulative or cause undue delay. Conversely, this subsection does not restrict the discretion of the Panel
to expand the scope of cross-examination or redirect examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Documents that have not been exchanged in advance may be shown to a witness on cross-examination. However, copies
of such documents must be distributed to the Panel and to other participants or their counsel at hearing before being
shown to the witness at the time of cross-examination, unless the Panel directs otherwise. If the document is not,
or will not be, supported by a witness for the cross-examining party, that document can be used solely to impeach the
witness's direct testimony and cannot itself be relied upon in findings of fact as rebutting the witness' direct testimony.
However, upon leave from the Panel, the document may be admitted as evidence without a sponsoring witness if official
notice is proper, or if, in the Panel's view, the cross-examined witness is the proper sponsoring witness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) A CARP will encourage individuals or groups with the same or similar interests in a proceeding to select a single
representative to conduct their examination and cross-examination for them. However, if there is no agreement on
the selection of a representative, each individual or group will be allowed to conduct its own examination and cross-examination,
but only on issues affecting its particular interests, provided that the questioning is not repetitious or cumulative
of the questioning of their parties within the group.

Admissibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In any public hearing before a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, evidence that is not unduly repetitious or cumulative
and is relevant and material shall be admissible. The testimony of any witness will not be considered evidence in a
proceeding unless the witness has been sworn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Documentary evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evidence that is submitted in the form of documents or detailed data and information shall be presented as exhibits.
Relevant and material matter embraced in a document containing other matter not material or relevant or not intended
as evidence must be plainly designated as the matter offered in evidence, and the immaterial or irrelevant parts shall
be marked clearly so as to show they are not intended as evidence. In cases where a document in which material and relevant
matter occurs is of such bulk that it would unnecessarily encumber the record, it may be marked for identification
and the relevant and material parts, once properly authenticated, may be read into the record. If the Panel desires,
a true copy of the material and relevant matter may be presented in extract form, and submitted as evidence. Anyone
presenting documents as evidence must present copies to all other participants at the hearing or their attorneys,
and afford them an opportunity to examine the documents in their entirety and offer into evidence any other portion
that may be considered material and relevant.

Documents filed with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or Copyright Office. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the matter offered in evidence is contained in documents already on file with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel

If a public document such as an official report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic data, is offered
in evidence either in whole or in part, and if the document has been issued by an Executive Department, a legislative
agency or committee, or a Federal administrative agency (Government-owned corporations included), and is proved
by the party offering it to be reasonably available to the public, the document need not be produced physically, but
may be offered instead by identifying the document and signaling the relevant parts.

To close the record of hearing, the chairperson of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel shall make an announcement
that the taking of testimony has concluded. In its discretion the Panel may close the record as of a future specified

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''),
as amended, requires that the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP'') include
a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,
or contaminants throughout the United States. The National Priorities List (``NPL'') constitutes this list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') proposes to add new sites to the NPL. This 16th proposed revision to
the NPL includes 16 sites in the General Superfund Section and 10 in the Federal Facilities Section. The identification
of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to
assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what
CERCLA-financed remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. This action does not affect the 1,192 sites currently
listed on the NPL (1,069 in the General Superfund Section and 123 in the Federal Facilities Section). However, it does
increase the number of proposed sites to 97 (67 in the General Superfund Section and 30 in the Federal Facilities Section).
Final and proposed sites now total 1,289.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C.
9601&hyph;9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act'') in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA
was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law No. 99&hyph;499,
100 stat. 1613 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To implement CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180),
pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines
and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,
or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases
or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action.'' As defined in CERCLA
section 101(24), remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involves response actions that are consistent
with a permanent remedy for a release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mechanisms for determining priorities for possible remedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under
CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') and financed by other persons are included in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)
(55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high
on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which is appendix A of 40 CFR part 300. On December 14, 1990 (55 FR 51532), EPA
promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The revised HRS evaluates
four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate
the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants to pose a threat to human
health or the environment. Those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless
of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable,
the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest
danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed whether
or not they score above 28.50, if all of the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a
health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority than to use its removal authority
to respond to the release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these criteria, and pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA promulgates a list
of national priorities among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants
throughout the United States. That list, which is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL'').
CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.''
The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably
as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised
at least annually. A site may undergo CERCLA-financed remedial action only after it is placed on the NPL, as provided
in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then,
most recently on October 14, 1992 (57 FR 47180). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPL includes two sections, one of sites being evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''),
and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive
Order 12580 and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying out most response actions at facilities
under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible for preparing an HRS score and determining
if the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly
less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section includes those facilities at which EPA is not the
lead agency.

Deletions/Cleanups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP
in 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 56 sites from the General Superfund
Section of the NPL, most recently the Suffern Village Well Field, Village of Suffern, New York (58 FR 30989, May 28,
1993), Pesticide Lab, Yakima, Washington (58 FR 46087, September 1, 1993), LaBounty Site, Charles City, Iowa (58
FR 50218, October 6, 1993), Aidex Corporation, Council Bluffs, Iowa (58 FR 54297, October 21, 1993), Hydro-Flex Inc.,
Topeka, KS (58 FR 59369, November 9, 1993) and Plymouth Harbor/Cannon Engineering Corp., Plymouth, Massachusetts
(58 FR 61029, November 19, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also has developed an NPL construction completion list (``CCL'') to simplify its system of categorizing sites
and to better communicate the successful completion of cleanup activities (58 FR 12142, March 2, 1993). Sites qualify
for the CCL when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any necessary physical construction is complete, whether or not final cleanup levels or other requirements have
been achieved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA has determined that the response action should be limited to measures that do not involve construction (e.g.,
institutional controls); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The site qualifies for deletion from the NPL. Inclusion of a site on the CCL has no legal significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 55 sites that have been deleted from the NPL because they have been cleaned up (the Waste Research
and Reclamation site was deleted based on deferral to another program and is not considered cleaned up), an additional
162 sites are also in the NPL CCL, all but one from the General Superfund Section. Thus, as of October 1993, the CCL consists
of 217 sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleanups at sites on the NPL do not reflect the total picture of Superfund accomplishments. As of September 30, 1993,
EPA had conducted 591 removal actions at NPL sites, and 1,734 removal actions at non-NPL sites. Information on removals
is available from the Superfund hotline.

Pursuant to the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c), this document proposes to add 26 sites to the NPL. The General Superfund Section
includes 1,069 sites, and the Federal Facilities Section includes 123 sites, for a total of 1,192 sites on the NPL.
Final and proposed sites now total 1,289. These numbers reflect EPA's decision to voluntarily remove the Hexcel Corporation
site, in Livermore, CA, from the NPL.

With the exception of Raymark Industries, Inc. (Stratford, Connecticut), Lower Ecorse Creek Dump (Wyandotte, Michigan),
and Tennessee Products (Chanttanooga, Tennessee) which are sites being proposed based on the ATSDR health advisory
criteria, and Boomsnub/Airco (Vancouver, Washington) which has been designated as a State top priority, the Headquarters
docket for this rule contains HRS score sheets for each proposed site; a Documentation Record for each site describing
the information used to compute the score; pertinent information for any site affected by particular statutory requirements
or EPA listing policies; and a list of documents referenced in the Documentation Record. Each Regional docket for
this rule, except for the three ATSDR health advisory sites and the State top priority mentioned above, contains all
of the information in the Headquarters docket for sites in that Region, plus the actual reference documents containing
the data principally relied upon and cited by EPA in calculating or evaluating the HRS scores for sites in that Region.
These reference documents are available only in the Regional dockets. For the three sites proposed on the basis of
health advisory criteria, both the Headquarters and Regional dockets contain the public health advisories issued
by ATSDR, and EPA memoranda supporting the findings that in each case the release poses a significant threat to public
health and that it would be more cost-effective to use remedial rather than removal authorities at the site. For the
site that has been designated a top priority by the State, both the Headquarters and Regional dockets contain supporting
documentation. Interested parties may view documents, by appointment only, in the Headquarters or the appropriate
Regional docket or copies may be requested from the Headquarters or appropriate Regional docket. An informal written
request, rather than a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act, should be the ordinary procedure for obtaining
copies of any of these documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considers all comments received during the comment period. During the comment period, comments are placed in
the Headquarters docket and are available to the public on an ``as received'' basis. A complete set of comments will
be available for viewing in the Regional docket approximately one week after the formal comment period closes. Comments
received after the comment period closes will be available in the Headquarters docket and in the Regional docket on
an ``as received'' basis.

during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In past rules, EPA has attempted to respond to late comments, or when that was not practicable, to read all late comments
and address those that brought to the Agency's attention a fundamental error in the scoring of a site. (See, most recently,
57 FR 4824 (February 7, 1992)). Although EPA intends to pursue the same policy with sites in this rule, EPA can guarantee
that it will consider only those comments postmarked by the close of the formal comment period. EPA cannot delay a final
listing decision solely to accommodate consideration of late comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain instances, interested parties have written to EPA concerning sites which were not at that time proposed
to the NPL. If those sites are later proposed to the NPL, parties should review their earlier concerns and, if still
appropriate, resubmit those concerns for consideration during the formal comment period. Site-specific correspondence
received prior to the period of formal proposal and comment will not generally be included in the docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96&hyph;848,
96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)) states the primary purpose of the NPL:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities
and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or site on the list does
not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities of its owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake
any action, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent government action in the form of remedial actions
or enforcement actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriate procedural
safeguards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management tool. The identification
of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to
assess the nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine
what CERCLA remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites that EPA
believes warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may, to the extent potentially responsible parties
are identifiable at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA-financed
remedial action.

Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After initial discovery of a site at which a release or threatened release may exist, EPA begins a series of increasingly
complex evaluations. The first step, the Preliminary Assessment (``PA''), is a low-cost review of existing information
to determine if the site poses a threat to public health or the environment. If the site presents a serious imminent
threat, EPA may take immediate removal action. If the PA shows that the site presents a threat but not an imminent threat,
EPA will generally perform a more extensive study called the Site Inspection (``SI''). The SI involves collecting
additional information to better understand the extent of the problem at the site, screen out sites that will not qualify
for the NPL, and obtain data necessary to calculate an HRS score for sites which warrant placement on the NPL and further
study. EPA may perform removal actions at any time during the process. To date EPA has completed approximately 35,000
PAs and approximately 17,000 SIs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990) limits expenditure of the Trust Fund for remedial actions
to sites on the NPL. However, EPA may take enforcement actions under CERCLA or other applicable statutes against responsible
parties regardless of whether the site is on the NPL, although, as a practical matter, the focus of EPA's CERCLA enforcement
actions has been and will continue to be on NPL sites. Similarly, in the case of CERCLA removal actions, EPA has the authority
to act at any site, whether listed or not, that meets the criteria of the NCP in 40 CFR 300.415(b)(2) (55 FR 8842, March
8, 1990). EPA's policy is to pursue cleanup of NPL sites using all the appropriate response and/or enforcement actions
available to the Agency, including authorities other than CERCLA. The Agency will decide on a site-by-site basis
whether to take enforcement or other action under CERCLA or other authorities prior to undertaking response action,
proceed directly with Trust Fund-financed response actions and seek to recover response costs after cleanup, or
do both. To the extent feasible, once sites are on the NPL, EPA will determine high-priority candidates for CERCLA-financed
response action and/or enforcement action through both State and Federal initiatives. EPA will take into account
which approach is more likely to accomplish cleanup of the site most expeditiously while using CERCLA's limited resources
as efficiently as possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the ranking of sites by HRS scores is considered, it does not, by itself, determine the sequence in which EPA
funds remedial response actions, since the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient to determine
either the extent of contamination or the appropriate response for a particular site (40 CFR 300.425(b)(2), 55 FR
8845, March 8, 1990). Additionally, resource constraints may preclude EPA from evaluating all HRS pathways; only
those presenting significant risk or sufficient to make a site eligible for the NPL may be evaluated. Moreover, the
sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency's attention first, so that addressing sites strictly
on the basis of ranking would in some cases require stopping work at sites where it was already underway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More detailed studies of a site are undertaken in the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (``RI/FS'') that
typically follows listing. The purpose of the RI/FS is to assess site conditions and evaluate alternatives to the
extent necessary to select a remedy (40 CFR 300.430(a)(2) (55 FR 8846, March 8, 1990)). It takes into account the amount
of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants released into the environment, the risk to affected populations
and environment, the cost to remediate contamination at the site, and the response actions that have been taken by
potentially responsible parties or others. Decisions on the type and extent of response action to be taken at these
sites are made in accordance with 40 CFR 300.415 (55 FR 8842, March 8, 1990) and 40 CFR 300.430 (55 FR 8846, March 8, 1990).
After conducting these additional studies, EPA may conclude that initiating a CERCLA remedial action using the Trust
Fund at some sites on the NPL is not appropriate because of more pressing needs at other sites, or because a private party
cleanup is already underway pursuant to an enforcement action. Given the limited resources available in the Trust
Fund, the Agency must carefully balance the relative needs for response at the numerous sites it has studied. It is
also possible that EPA will conclude after further analysis that the site does not warrant remedial action.

 for placement on the NPL (or even sites that have not been proposed for placement on the NPL) pursuant to the Agency's
removal authority under CERCLA, as outlined in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.415. Although an RI/FS generally is conducted
at a site after it has been placed on the NPL, in a number of circumstances the Agency elects to conduct an RI/FS at a site
proposed for placement on the NPL in preparation for a possible Trust Fund-financed remedial action, such as when
the Agency believes that a delay may create unnecessary risks to public health or the environment. In addition, the
Agency may conduct an RI/FS to assist in determining whether to conduct a removal or enforcement action at a site.

The purpose of the NPL is merely to identify releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that are priorities
for further evaluation. The Agency believes that it would be neither feasible nor consistent with this limited purpose
for the NPL to attempt to describe releases in precise geographical terms. The term ``facility'' is broadly defined
in CERCLA to include any area where a hazardous substance has ``come to be located'' (CERCLA section 101(9)), and the
listing process is not intended to define or reflect boundaries of such facilities or releases. Site names are provided
for general identification purposes only. Knowledge of the geographic extent of sites will be refined as more information
is developed during the RI/FS and even during implementation of the remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the NPL does not assign liability or define the geographic extent of a release, a listing need not be amended
if further research into the contamination at a site reveals new information as to its extent. This is further explained
in preambles to past NPL rules, most recently February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5598).

Sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) of CERCLA authorize the Fund to reimburse certain parties for necessary costs of
performing a response action. As is described in more detail at 58 FR 5460 (January 21, 1993), 40 CFR part 307, there
are two major limitations placed on the payment of claims for response actions. First, only private parties, certain
potentially responsible parties (including States and political subdivisions), and certain foreign entities
are eligible to file such claims. Second, all response actions under sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) must receive
prior approval, or ``preauthorization,'' from EPA.

III. Contents of This Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Table 1 identifies the 16 NPL sites in the General Superfund Section and Table 2 identifies the 10 NPL sites in the Federal
Facilities Section being proposed in this rule. Both tables follow this preamble. With the exception of Raymark Industries,
Inc. (Stratford, Connecticut), Lower Ecorse Creek Dump (Wyandotte, Michigan), and Tennessee Products (Chattanooga,
Tennessee) which are sites being proposed based on ATSDR health advisory criteria, and Boomsnub/Airco (Vancouver,
Washington) which has been designated as a State top priority, all sites are proposed based on HRS scores of 28.50 or
above. The sites in Table 1 are listed alphabetically by State, for ease of identification, with group number identified
to provide an indication of relative ranking. To determine group number, sites on the NPL are placed in groups of 50;
for example, a site in Group 4 of this proposal has a score that falls within the range of scores covered by the fourth
group of 50 sites on the General Superfund Section of the NPL. Sites in the Federal Facilities Section are also presented
by group number based on groups of 50 sites in the General Superfund Section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among'' the known releases or threatened releases
of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain
enumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to
use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for possible
remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA has chosen not to place certain types of sites
on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later determines that sites not
listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may place them on the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The listing policies and statutory requirements of relevance to this proposed rule cover sites subject to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'') (42 U.S.C. 6901&hyph;6991i) and Federal facility sites. These policies
and requirements are explained below and have been explained in greater detail in previous rulemakings (56 FR 5598,
February 11, 1991).

Releases From Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's policy is that non-Federal sites subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities will not, in general,
be placed on the NPL. However, EPA will list certain categories of RCRA sites subject to Subtitle C corrective action
authorities, as well as other sites subject to those authorities, if the Agency concludes that doing so best furthers
the aims of the NPL/RCRA policy and the CERCLA program. EPA has explained these policies in detail in the past (51 FR
21054, June 10, 1986; 53 FR 23978, June 24, 1988; 54 FR 41000, October 4, 1989; 56 FR 5602, February 11, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with EPA's NPL/RCRA policy, EPA is proposing to add one site to the General Superfund Section of the NPL
that may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities, the Raymark Industries, Inc. site in Stratford,
Connecticut, which is being proposed based on ATSDR health advisory criteria. Material has been placed in the public
docket establishing that the facility operated as a hazardous waste generator and land disposal facility. Raymark
Industries, Inc. is a RCRA Subtitle C regulated facility which has initiated bankruptcy proceedings. Listing of
the Raymark Industries, Inc. site on the NPL under these circumstances is consistent with EPA's NPL/RCRA deferral
policy.

Releases From Federal Facility Sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 13, 1989 (54 FR 10520), the Agency announced a policy for placing Federal facility sites on the NPL if they meet
the eligibility criteria (e.g., an HRS score of 28.50 or greater), even if the Federal facility also is subject to the
corrective action authorities of RCRA Subtitle C. In that way, those sites could be cleaned up under CERCLA, if appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to add ten sites to the Federal Facilities Section of the NPL.

Raymark Industries, Inc. in Stratford, Connecticut, Lower Ecorse Creek Dump in Wyandotte, Michigan, and Tennessee
Products in Chattanooga, Tennessee, are being proposed for the NPL on the basis of section 425(c)(3) of the NCP, 40

Raymark Industries, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Raymark Industries, Inc. site includes the Raymark Industries, Inc. facility and other locations where Raymark
Industries, Inc. facility waste has come to be located and that EPA determines pose a significant threat to public
health. The Raymark Industries, Inc. facility comprises about 500,000 square feet of office, storage and production
space on 33.4 acres next to Interstate Route 95. A public recreation park containing a baseball diamond and recreation
field is located immediately northwest of the site. The facility began operations at this location in 1919 and primarily
manufactured asbestos brake linings and other automotive asbestos products until operations ceased in 1989. The
facility operated as a hazardous waste generator and land disposal facility. The hazardous waste produced on-site
consisted primarily of lead-asbestos dust, metals and solvents. From 1919 to July 1984, Raymark Industries, Inc.
used a system of lagoons to attempt to capture the waste lead and asbestos dust produced by its manufacturing process.
Over this 65 year period, these lagoon systems were located throughout the western and central areas of the facility.
As the lagoons filled with sludge they were covered with asphalt and often built upon. Dredged materials were also
landfilled at other locations, including the adjacent ballfield. Interim actions intended to stabilize waste have
been conducted at the Raymark Industries, Inc. facility and the ballfield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An intensive surficial sampling program of the other locations where waste from Raymark Industries, Inc. is known
or suspected to have been received and used as fill was instituted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection and EPA in April 1993. Based upon the analytical results of this activity, which indicated concentrations
of lead, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), ATSDR issued a public health advisory on May 26, 1993 for
``Raymark Industries/Stratford Asbestos Sites''. The advisory recommended dissociation of the public from areas
where exposure to Raymark Industries, Inc. waste at levels of health concern can occur. The presence of dioxin in Raymark
Industries, Inc. waste has subsequently been confirmed. The advisory was based on the concern that people could be
exposed to site-related contaminants through inhalation, direct dermal contact, ingestion of waste present in
the soil, and consumption of potentially contaminated area seafood.

The results from samples collected to determine the lateral extent of contamination at known disposal locations
has served as the basis for supplemental ATSDR site-specific Health Consultations. ATSDR recommended immediate
response actions based upon the finding of imminent health threats. Sampling to determine the vertical extent of
contamination at these disposal areas is presently being conducted to expedite complete site characterization.
Site characterization and initiation of mitigation actions at known locations and at newly discovered sites are
being prioritized for early action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's assessment is that the site poses a significant threat to human health and anticipates that it will be more cost-effective
to use remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the site. This finding is set out in a memorandum
dated November 3, 1993, from Merrill S. Hohman, Region 1 Waste Management Division Director, to Larry Reed, Hazardous
Site Evaluation Division Director. This memorandum and the ATSDR advisory are available in the Superfund docket
for this proposed rule. Based on this information, and the references in support of proposal, EPA believes that the
Raymark Industries, Inc. site is appropriate for the NPL pursuant to 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3).

Lower Ecorse Creek Dump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site is located in Wyandotte, Wayne County, Michigan. The site consists of the residence
at 470 North Drive and three neighboring parcels of land. The site occupies a level area with the back of the lots abutting
the Ecorse River. During the period between 1945 and 1955, and prior to the house at 470 North Drive being built, the
low lying swampy area of the creek was filled with material from local industries. Some of the fill material contained
what has been confirmed as ferric ferrocyanide, commonly referred to as ``Prussian Blue''. The blue soil was also
found across the street at 471 North Drive, approximately two feet below the surface and the owner of the residence
at 469 North Drive also reported that he found the blue soil in his yard. In addition, there are two vacant lots east of
470 North Drive where Prussian Blue is exposed. Neighborhood children have used portions of these lots as a go-cart
track and wearing of the topsoil by the go-carts has exposed the Prussian Blue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA was contacted by the Wayne County Health Department on October 25, 1989. EPA tasked its Technical Assistance
Team (TAT) on October 27, 1989, to conduct a site investigation and sampling. Sampling results were provided to ATSDR
for review and assessment. ATSDR's review on November 22, 1989, concluded that ``The levels of cyanide found in the
soil do present an urgent public health threat. Steps to eliminate any direct contact with the contaminated soil need
to be taken immediately.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following ATSDR's determination that the presence of cyanide-contaminated wastes in an unrestricted residential
area presented an immediate and significant public health threat, EPA's Emergency Response Branch initiated removal
activities. On December 4, 1989, work commenced to cover the contaminated areas with six inches of clean topsoil and
fill in areas of the driveway and sidewalk which had been previously excavated by the property owner. This action eliminated
physical contact with Prussian Blue and related cyanide compounds which had spread throughout the area. The initial
action was completed in the summer of 1990 with the establishment of a vegetative cover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Final ATSDR Health Advisory which was released on August 13, 1993, recommended the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Immediately dissociate the affected residents from cyanide contamination, which is at levels of health concern
in residential subsurface soils; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Implement permanent measures to remediate the contamination as appropriate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider including the Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site on the EPA National Priorities List or, using other statutory
or regulatory authorities as appropriate, take other steps to characterize the site and take necessary action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional recommendations by ATSDR include conducting a door-to-door well survey and well sampling to determine
the extent and level of any groundwater contamination. ATSDR also suggests restricting digging into contaminated
subsurface soil to prevent human contact with contaminated soils and released cyanide gas.

EPA's assessment is that the site poses a significant threat to human health and anticipates that it will be more cost-effective
to use remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the site considering the costs and time involved
in an extensive groundwater study and potential groundwater remediation. This finding is set out in a memorandum
dated August 30, 1993, from William E. Muno, Region 5 Waste Management Division Director, to Larry Reed, Hazardous
Site Evaluation Division Director. This memorandum and the ATSDR advisory are available in the Superfund docket
for this proposed rule. Based on this information, and the references in support of proposal, EPA believes that the
Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site is appropriate for the NPL pursuant to 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tennessee Products site, is an aggregation of Southern Coke Corporation (Southern Coke), Chattanooga Creek
Tar Deposit Site and Hamill Road Dump No. 2. The site is located in a heavily populated, low-income, urban and industrial
area in the Chattanooga Creek (the creek) basin in Chattanooga, Hamilton County, Tennessee. The site consists of
the former Tennessee Products coke plant and its associated uncontrolled coal-tar dumping grounds in Chattanooga
Creek and its floodplain. Uncontrolled dumping of coal-tar wastes has contaminated the facility, groundwater resources
underlying the facility, and surface water resources downstream of the facility including wetlands and fisheries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former Tennessee Products coke plant (a.k.a. Southern Coke) is located at 4800 Central Avenue, south of Hamill/Hooker
Road and approximately one mile west of the creek. The coal-tar wastes are located along an approximate 2.5 mile section
of the creek extending from just upstream of Hamill Road bridge to the creek's confluence with Dobbs Branch. The coal-tar
deposits are the result of dumping coal-tar wastes directly into the creek and onto the floodplain within the immediate
vicinity of the creek channel. The largest coal-tar deposits have been found in the creek bed and along its banks within
a 1 mile segment of the creek between Hamill Road and 38th Street. Analyses for polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) as well as visual inspection of sediment cores confirm that coal-tar has heavily contaminated this segment
of the creek plus an additional 1.5 miles of the creek downstream from this segment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATSDR issued a Public Health Advisory for the Tennessee Products Site on August 20, 1993, based on the chemical and
physical hazard presented by the coal-tar deposits at the site. The Advisory recommends the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Dissociate residents from the coal-tar deposits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Continue site characterization to address the potential for migration of contaminants; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider the Tennessee Products Site for inclusion on the NPL; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) As appropriate, consider other coal-tar contaminated sites along the creek for inclusion on the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have been conducted on Chattanooga Creek on several occasions by EPA and other agencies since 1973. Several
of these studies indicate that coal-tar constituents have contaminated the creek and its sediments. The latest of
these studies, conducted in 1992 by EPA, has revealed the extent of the coal-tar dumping along the creek. This new information,
in combination with historical file information, supports the aggregation of the above mentioned sites. The aggregation
criteria is discussed in a memo to the file, from Loften Carr, Site Assessment Manager, EPA Region 4, dated June 8, 1993,
which is included in the nomination package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historical sampling and aerial photographic evidence indicate that the tar was dumped into the creek, on the banks
and in areas near the creek over several years during the 1940s and 1950s. During World War II, the U.S. Government purchased
the Tennessee Products facility and operated it for the war effort. The facility was sold back to the company after
the end of the war. Due to increased coke production during the war, a substantial increase in waste generated by Tennessee
Products may have strained waste handling procedures practiced by Tennessee Products before 1941. Documentation
of the disposal practices of Tennessee Products during this time period is not available; however, Tennessee Products
maintained a private sewer line which discharged directly into the creek.

This action was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR
51735, October 4, 1993) and Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987). No changes were made in response to
OMB.

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impacts of this action on small entities, or certify
that the action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By small entities, the
Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this rule proposes to revise the NCP, it is not a typical regulatory change since it does not automatically impose
costs. As stated above, proposing sites to the NPL does not in itself require any action by any party, nor does it determine
the liability of any party for the cost of cleanup at the site. Further, no identifiable groups are affected as a whole.
As a consequence, impacts on any group are hard to predict. A site's proposed inclusion on the NPL could increase the
likelihood of adverse impacts on responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs), but at this time EPA cannot identify
the potentially affected businesses or estimate the number of small businesses that might also be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does expect that placing the sites in this proposed rule on the NPL could significantly affect certain industries,
or firms within industries, that have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problems. However,
EPA does not expect the listing of these sites to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, economic impacts would occur only through enforcement and cost-recovery actions, which EPA takes at
its discretion on a site-by-site basis. EPA considers many factors when determining enforcement actions, including
not only the firm's contribution to the problem, but also its ability to pay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizations would be determined on a similar
case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, I hereby certify that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, this proposed regulation does not require a regulatory flexibility
analysis.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 22, 1985 the Coast Guard published an interim final rule (IFR) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 33923) which established structural and performance standards and procedures for approval of hybrid inflatable
personal flotation devices (PFD). This IFR allowed the approval of several hybrid PFD's but not enough devices were
made and sold to make a significant difference in the number of lives saved by this superior performing and more comfortable
PFD. The changes proposed are designed to make hybrid PFD's more affordable and attractive to recreational boaters.
The changes include lowering manufacturing costs by reducing the amount of repetitive testing required. Increases
in buoyancy are proposed to compensate for removing of the Type V criteria of being ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN'' to allow
approval of hybrids a Type I, II, and III. Types I, II, and III are proposed in addition to the existing Type V category.
This SNPRM also proposes approval of hybrids for youths and small children. These proposals are in hopes that hybrid
PFD's will be more widely used and potentially save more lives.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 29, 1985 (50 FR 21878). Corrections to the NPRM were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 18, 1985 (50 FR 25274). The comment period on that proposal ended on July 15, 1985.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed requirements for both hybrid PFD's and inflatable lifejackets. An interim final rule promulgating
hybrid PFD requirements was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 22, 1985 (50 FR 33923). Corrections to this rule were published on February 4, 1986 (51 FR 4349). Comments
that addressed concerns relating to the hybrid PFD requirements were analyzed and discussed in the August 22, 1985
publication.

Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes changes to the requirements for approving hybrid inflatable PFD's and for the carriage of hybrid
PFD's on commercial vessels. The requirements are self-explanatory and have been included in a list which cites each
specific section number for ease of presentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adopted, the changes proposed by this SNPRM may be incorporated by reference in the regulation by citing an updated
revision to Underwriters Laboratories Standard 1517, Hybrid Personal Flotation Devices.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Primarily these revisions are based on the U.S. Coast Guard's experience in evaluating for approval four models of
hybrids by four different manufacturers. Also considered are the discussions and comments at the 1991 and 1992 meetings
of the Industry Advisory Council (IAC) of Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and the November 11, 1991 National Boating
Safety Advisory Council (NBSAC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This SNPRM proposes approval of hybrid inflatable PFD's for youths and small children. The rule changes would allow
approval of recreational hybrid inflatable PFD's for weight ranges down to 14 kg (30 lb) and commercial hybrid inflatable
PFDs's for persons weighing over 23 kg (50 lb). It is the Coast Guard's position that the required amount of inherent
buoyancy and provision for automatic inflation mechanisms on all hybrids for small children, between 14&hyph;23
kg (30&hyph;50 lb), justifies approval of hybrids in these weight ranges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the requirements in the SNPRM are adopted hybrid PFD's will be approved in ten recreational and four commercial
Type and size categories. Several tables have been added to improve understanding of the various categories. Comments
are requested on the clarity and reader comprehensibility of the proposed requirements for the various Types in this
format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments/revisions are divided into seven areas as follows:

Changes To Make Use of Hybrids More Attractive
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of changes are proposed to make hybrid inflatable PFD's more attractive to recreational boaters and manufacturers.
The intent of the interim final rule was to provide regulations which ensure introduction of hybrid PFD's with little
or no increased risk due to failure of the inflation system. When placed into practice the rules proved too burdensome
to attract many recreational boaters to buy the PFD's and for manufacturers to produce them. As a result production
and use of hybrid PFD's is very limited. To date two manufacturers have actually obtained approval, another is pending
approval, and only one is currently producing. Demand from consumers for hybrid PFD's has been minimal. A market analysis
to determine what advantages or disadvantages consumers may see in hybird PFD's has not been conducted. Information
which may provide insight into this specific area of concern is solicited by the Coast Guard and comments from interested
parties are encouraged.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard's efforts to encourage production and use of hybrid PFD's is based upon comments obtained from the
manufacturers of hybrid PFD's during the 1991 and 1992 Underwriters Laboratories Industry Advisory Council and
1991 National Boating Safety Advisory Council. In this light, the Coast Guard proposes to change the following sections
to make hybrids more appealing to boaters and to reduce the regulatory burden placed upon manufacturers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 160.077&hyph;1&blank;Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Discussions at the 1991 Underwriters Laboratory Industry Advisory Conference indicated that consumers are
discouraged from purchasing hybrid PFD's because the REQUIRED TO BE WORN limitation causes legal questions in the
users mind and leaves little flexibility in use of the devices. Also, in May 1992 NBSAC recommended carriage of hybrid
PFD's be allowed without being ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.'' To encourage consumers to purchase_and ultimately wear_hybrid
PFD's the Scope will be revised to indicate that hybrid PFD's approved as Type I, II, or III devices do not have the restriction
of being REQUIRED TO BE WORN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Under the interim final rule a hybrid PFD is approved only for adults. The Coast Guard proposed to amend this paragraph
to include hybrid inflatable PFD's for small children weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb), and for youths weighing
23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90 lb). Current regulations require hybrid PFD's with Type I and II performance to have automatic
inflation mechanisms. Hybrid PFD's for use by small children weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb) would be approved
a Type I or II only. Hybrid PFD's approved for use by youths would be aprpoved as Types I, II, III, and V. Hybrid PFD's for
infants, persons weighing less than 14 kg are not proposed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 160.077&hyph;3&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(j) The USCG is proposing adoption of standards for approval of hybrid inflatable PFD's for youths, weighing 23&hyph;40
kg (50&hyph;90 lb), and small children, weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb). Under the proposal this paragraph
will be revised to redefine ``Reference Vest'' to include models CKM&hyph;1, child medium; and model CKS&hyph;2,
child small, meeting subpart 160.047 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 160.077&hyph;5&blank;Required to be Worn
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c)(1) Recreational hybrid PFD's approved as Type I, II, or III will meet carriage requirements without being worn.
Therefore, this paragraph will be changed to indicate that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only Type V 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
recreational hybrid PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) Type I, II, or III hybrid PFD's will not be bound to Type V restrictions. In keeping with the change to &sect;160.077&hyph;1(b)
and (d) this paragraph will be revised to indicate that hybrid PFD's may be approved as Types I, II, III, or V for persons
in various weight ranges over 23 kg (50 lb.) and as Types I and II for persons weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb).
Type V is not a performance Type. Type V approval means the device is limited to special uses or conditions. Type V hybrid
PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN`` because they have reduced inherent buoyancy. Type V hybrid PFD's will be required
to have Type I, II, or III performance when inflated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The proposed change to hybrid PFD Types approved, discussed in &sect;160.077&hyph;7(a) of this section, authorizes
hybrid PFD's to be approved as Type I, II, III, or V for persons weighing over 23 kg (50 lb) and Types I and II for persons
weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb). To be consistent with that change, this paragraph will be revised to indicate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b)(4) There have been no field complaints concerning failure of the inflation chamber on hybrid inflatable PFD's.
Studies conducted by the USCG Auxiliary (INFLATABLE PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE STUDY, Report No. CG&hyph;M&hyph;5&hyph;81)
and The Boat/U.S. Foundation for Boating Safety (``INFLATABLE PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE STUDY: An Examination
of Inflatable PFD Performance and Reliability in Public Use'' dated March 11, 1993) have provided additional information
on fully inflatable PFD's which leads the USCG to conclude that one inflation chamber can provide reliability equivalent
to dual chambers in hybrid PFD's. Therefore, the required number of inflation chambers on commercial hybrid PFD's
has been reduced from two to one. However, if the device is marked as a ``lifejacket'' meeting the Safety of Life at Sea
(SOLAS) requirements, two inflation chambers must still be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(8) Adults have a wide range of chest sizes. To provide all passengers with a suitable size PFD, the Coast Guard proposes
to add a requirement that adult commercial hybrid PFD's to be universally sized.(b)(9) Operators of commercial vessels
may be required to have PFD's with approved PFD lights attached. The USCG proposes to drop the requirement for commercial
hybrid PFD's to be provided with an approved PFD light at time of manufacture as discussed in &sect;160.077&hyph;13(d).
Instead, a requirement will be added to provide all commercial hybrid PFD's with a PFD light attachment at time of manufacture.
This change is intended to provide vessel operators with an option to attach a PFD light, relieve manufacturers of
this requirement, and avoid potential damage to the inflation chamber due to improper light attachment in the field.

Section 160.077&hyph;23&blank;Over-pressure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h)(4) The inflation chambers on hybrid PFD's sometimes fail to hold the required pressure during the over-pressure
test although they remain serviceable. The loss of pressure is often attributed to the stretching of the inflation
chamber material, thus increasing the volume of the chamber and reducing the static pressure reading. This paragraph
revision is proposed to allow prestressing of the inflation chamber.

(b) through (e) It is anticipated that the designs for Type I, II, III, or V Recreational hybrid PFDs will be different.
Therefore, paragraph (b) will be revised and several new paragraphs added to require that each Type I, II, III, or V
Recreational Hybrid PFD be provided with an owner's manual appropriate to that type PFD. The proposed method of change
is to adopt revisions to Underwriters Laboratories ``Standards for Safety'', UL 1517, section 40, ``Owners Manual,''
if the necessary revisions can be made in a timely manner. In this SNPRM, the test of the proposed changes is published
in its entirety where the current text of UL 1517 is not applicable to Type I, II, and III hybrids. Text of this SNPRM would
be used in the final rule if UL 1517 is not revised at that time. Former paragraph (c) is redesignated (f), which is discussed
later in this preamble. The new paragraph (c) addresses the manual for Type I, II, or III recreational hybrids PFDs
which do not have to be worn to meet carriage requirements. The requirements for Type V recreational hybrid PFD owner's

(a)(1) There has been some confusion concerning the number of inflation medium cartridges which should be provided
with the hybrid PFD at the time of sale. This paragraph has been changed to indicate that when hybrid PFD's with a manual

only two spare cartridges need to be included. When hybrid PFD's are sold without an inflation medium cartridge loaded
into the inflation mechanism they must be provided with at least three cartridges.

Changes To Decrease Repetitive Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the required tests are repetitive and increase the cost of producing hybrid PFD's. Elimination of repetitious
testing should reduce manufacturing costs which may in turn encourage increased production. With the intent to encourage
greater production through lower production costs the following changes are proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b)(1)(i) Situations have occurred where extremely small lots (less than 50) of hybrid PFD's have been manufactured.
Requirements for testing each lot by both the manufacturer and laboratory inspector increase the individual cost
of hybrid PFD's produced in such small numbers. Reduction of repetitive testing is proposed by revising this paragraph
to combine the manufacturer's and laboratory inspector's tests when five consecutive lots do not exceed a total of
250 devices. This revision would reduce repetitive testing and decrease production costs without compromising
the safety of approved devices.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b)(2)(ii) Historically the number of hybrid PFD's produced has been nominal. In some calendar quarters very small
lots have been produced. The requirement for an independent laboratory inspection every quarter increases production
costs when small lots are produced. Reduction of independent laboratory inspections is proposed by changing this
paragraph to require one inspection annually when not more than five lots, with no more than 1000 devices per lot, are
produced per calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2)(iv) This paragraph will be revised to show reference to paragraph (b)(2)(v) which provides an exception to
the number of required records examinations, and test performance observations when not more than five lots are produced
during any calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2)(v) For the same reasons stated in the proposed changes to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, this paragraph
will be added to clarify that the number of required records examinations and test performance observations will
be changed to one annually when not more than five lots are produced per calendar year.

(d)(4) As per the reasons stated in proposed changes to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, this paragraph will
be revised to indicate that when the total production for any five consecutive lots does not exceed 250, the manufacturer's
and inspector's testing and inspection, can be combined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(5) Lots containing small numbers of hybrid PFD's are often produced. Requirements for individual tests and inspections
by both the manufacturer and the independent laboratory increase production costs when small lots are produced.
Reduction of repetitive test and inspections is proposed by authorizing the manufacturer's and inspector's tests
to be run on the same sample at the same time when the total production for any five consecutive lots does not exceed 250.TABLE

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To compensate for removing the REQUIRED TO BE WORN statement the Coast Guard is proposing to add additional inherent
buoyancy for recreational Type I, II, and III hybrid PFD's. Deliberations from the 1991 and 1992 Underwriters Laboratories
Industry Advisory Council meeting and the 1991 National Boating Safety Advisory Council concerning the amount of
additional buoyancy to add to adult hybrid PFD's were considered. The options considered and discussed at those meetings
included increasing the additional buoyancy to 40 N (9 lb) or 45 N (10 lb) in Type V hybrid for adults, weighing over 40
kg (90 lb). The design variations of either are not significant in affecting wear and comfort. The Coast Guard proposes
the 45 N (10 lb) option in order to provide a minimum buoyancy closer to the International Standards Organization (ISO)
proposed minimum standard of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
50 N.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this paragraph the Coast Guard is also proposing buoyancy specifications for recreational hybrid PFD's for persons
weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb) and 23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90 lb). The USCG is not proposing to approve recreational
hybrid inflatable PFD's for infants, weighing less than 14 kg (30 lb).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Coast Guard is proposing to increase the total required buoyancy when inflated for Type I recreational
hybrids for adults. The total buoyancy will be increased to 130 N (30 lb), in lieu of the 100 N (22 lb) inflated buoyancy
requirement for adult Type II, III, or V hybrids. This proposal is based on the Coast Guard's determination that this
buoyancy is the minimum amount necessary to provide performance as required by SOLAS 74/83. Depending on the PFD's
design buoyancy distribution, more buoyancy may be required. Although recreational devices are not required to
meet the requirements of SOLAS 74/83, the greater performance is consistent with the Type I classification and can
be obtained at nominal cost.

(b)(10) In lieu of the Type V requirement, the Coast Guard proposes to increase the minimum inherent and minimum total
buoyancies for adult Type I commercial hybrids. This proposed paragraph revision requires the minimum inherent
buoyancy for adult Type I commercial hybrids to be 70 N (15.5 lb), increased from 45 N (10 lb). The Coast Guard proposes
to increase the amount of total buoyancy for commercial Type I hybrids to 130 N (30 lb) in lieu of the 100 N (22 lb) total
buoyancy requirement for Type V hybrids.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition the Coast Guard proposes to increase the required inherent buoyancy in adult type V commercial hybrid
inflatable PFD's. To compensate for the loss of an extra inflation chamber, as discussed under ``

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is nonsignificant under Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). A Regulatory Evaluation
was originally placed in the rulemaking docket in 1985, reviewed in May 1991 with regard to inflatable lifejackets,
and reconsidered in April 1993, concerning hybrid PFD's in association with this SNPRM. The Regulatory Evaluation,
in spite of its age, was found still viable. The information obtained from the original study of inflatable lifejackets
has not changed significantly in light of a comparable two and a half year investigation conducted by the Boat/U.S.
Foundation for Boating Safety completed in March 1993. The annual number of casualties and drownings involving recreational
boating accidents has not changed significantly since these figures were gathered. Further, the Coast Guard is proposing
to improve the limited performance of devices already approved under the current regulations by requiring new Type
I, II, or III hybrid devices to have increased inherent buoyancy. This Regulatory Evaluation is available in the docket
for inspection or copying at the location indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
addresses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation provides an explanation of the estimated costs of these proposed regulations. There will no increase
in costs to any sector under these proposed changes since hybrid PFD's are only being approved as an option to existing
approved devices. The total approval costs per design are expected to be approximately $12,000 for hybrid inflatable
PFD's. Costs to approve other types of PFD's are approximately $6,000. The additional cost to approve hybrid PFD's
could easily be absorbed in the cost of the units produced. The cost increase per device would be small considering
the number of devices produced under authorization of each approval certificate. The Coast Guard anticipates that,
within the first year after issuing the final rules, one or two designs will be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production inspection costs imposed by these regulations will be approximately $1,000 for the largest size lot of
inflatable lifejackets permitted. This cost is similar to that incurred for other types of approved PFD's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The retail cost, per device, is expected to be $80&hyph;$200 for hybrid PFD's. Currently approved PFD's range in price
from $7&hyph;$200. Type I devices that could be replaced by hybrid PFD's have an average cost of about $40.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations provide an alternative to users for whom limited stowage space or other operational considerations
make the carriage of conventional inherently buoyant PFD's impractical or inadvisable. For these users, the optional
carriage of hybrid PFD's will meet their specific operational needs and will therefore justify the higher cost relative
to inherently buoyant PFD's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations will have little or no effect on federal, state, or local governments except in their capacities
as consumers of PFD's. Coast Guard steps to implement these proposed changes will be done within the scope of ongoing
marine safety activities, and there will be no need for additional federal budget commitments.

Small Entities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the information in the evaluation this proposal, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. If you feel that your business qualifies as a small entity and would suffer
significant, negative economic impact, please submit a comment explaining why your business qualifies as a small
entity and to what degree the proposed regulations would economically affect your business. Cost data submitted
will be thoroughly evaluated before publication of the final rule.

Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each
proposed rule which contains a collection of information requirement to determine whether the practical value of
the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection of information requirements include reporting,
recordkeeping, notification, and other similar requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal requires separate PFD manuals for each hybrid PFD Type which may increase paperwork burdens. However,
the Coast Guard has determined that this additional load will be balanced be decreasing the frequency of currently
approved collection of information requirements. The current requirements will be reduced by decreasing the number
of required inspections and tests.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking revises established safety
standards for hybrid inflatable personal flotation devices (PFD). The authority to regulate concerning PFD's is
committed to the Coast Guard by statute. Furthermore, since PFD's are manufactured and used in the national marketplace,
safety standards for PFD's should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. Therefore, if
this rule becomes final, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt State action addressing the same subject matter.

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. These
proposed rules are expected to have no significant effect on the environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination
statement has been prepared and has been placed in the rulemaking docket.

Type I_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type I PFD has the greatest required inherent buoyancy and turns most unconscious persons in the water from a face
down position to a vertical and slightly backward position, therefore, greatly increasing one's chances of survival.
The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters, especially for cruising on waters where there is a probability of delayed
rescue, such as large bodies of water where it is not likely that a significant number of boats will be in close proximity.
This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water. It is reversible and available in only two sizes_Adult
(over 40 kg (90lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb)) which are universal sizes (designed for all persons in the appropriate
category).

Type II_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type II PFD turns most wearers to a vertical and slightly backward position in the water. The turning action is not
as pronounced as with a Type I and the device will not turn as many persons under the same conditions as the Type I. The
Type II PFD is usually more comfortable to wear than the Type I. This Type PFD is normally sized for ease of emergency
donning and is available in the following sizes: Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)), Medium Child (23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90
lb)), and two categories of Small Child (less than 23 kg (50 lb) or less than 14 kg (30 lb). Additionally, some models
are sized by chest sizes. You may prefer to use the Type II where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where
it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing and other water activities.

Type III_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Type III PFD allows the wearer to assume a back of vertical position, and the device will maintain the wearer in that
position and have no tendency to turn the wearer face down. It is not designed to turn the wearer face up. A Type III is
generally more comfortable than a Type II, comes in a variety of styles which should be matched to the individual use,
and is often the best choice for water sports, such as skiing, hunting, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. This Type
PFD normally comes in many chest sizes and weight ranges; however, some universal sizes are available. You may also
prefer to use the Type III where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons
to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities.

Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A Type I, II, or III Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has a minimal amount of buoyancy
when deflated and significantly increased buoyancy when inflated (See accompanying table for actual buoyancy for
your Type of hybrid). When inflated it turns the wearer with the action of a Type I, II, or III PFD as indicated on its label.
This type of PFD provides an extra degree of comfort to the boater who will accept the responsibility for care of the
device and in-water trials to check its performance. The buoyancy provided by this PFD when not inflated will not float
approximately 90 percent of the boating public. Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with
enough inflation to float the wearer. It is suitable for use where there is or is not a probability of quick rescue depending
on the performance type marked on it. Type I hybrids are suitable where rescue may be slow coming, while Types II and
III are good only when there is a chance of fast rescue. Type I hybrids are approved in three weight ranges, adult, for
persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); youth, for persons weighing 23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90); and small child, for
persons weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb). Type II hybrid PFDs are approved in the same size ranges as Type I hybrids
but may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes. Type III hybrids are only approved in adult
and youth sizes but may also be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.''

Type IV_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type IV PFD is normally thrown or tossed to a person who has fallen overbroad and is intended to be grasped and held by
the person until rescued. While the Type IV is acceptable in place of a wearable device in certain instances, this type
is suitable only where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons to be
engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities. It is not recommended for use by non-swimmers and children.

Type V (General)_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type V PFD is a PFD approved for restricted uses or activities such as board sailing, or commercial white water rafting.
These PFDs are not usually suitable for other boating activities. The label on the PFD indicates whether a particular
design of Type V PFD can be used in a specific application, what restrictions or limitations apply, and its performance
type.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Type V Hybrid_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type V Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has a minimum deflated buoyancy and
significantly more buoyancy when inflated. In order for the device to be acceptable for use on recreational boats,
it must be worn except when the boat is not underway or when the user is below deck. When inflated it turns the wearer similar
to the action provided by a Type I, II, or III PFD (the type of performance is indicated on the label). This type of PFD
provides an extra degree of comfort to the boater who will wear a PFD by having a reducd amount of inherent buoyancy.
However, the user must accept the responsibility for care of the device and in-water trials to check its performance.
The buoyancy provided by this PFD when it is not inflated will float approximately 70 percent of the boating public.
Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough inflation to float the wearer. It is suitable
for use where there is or is not a probability of quick rescue depending on the performance type marked on it. This type
of PFD is approved in two sizes, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); and youth, for persons weighing 23&hyph;40
kg (50&hyph;90 lb), and may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.

This PFD has limited inherent buoyancy which means YOU MAY HAVE TO INFLATE IT TO FLOAT, and the inflatable portion requires
maintenance. In the event of an accident or fall overboard, the chance of any PFD aiding in your survival are greatly
increased if it is worn. Wearing this PFD makes its limitation much less significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is only one way to find out if you will float without inflation. That is to try this PFD in the water as explained
in [insert reference to the section of the manual that discusses how to test the PFD]. If you have not tested this device
in accordance with these guidelines, the Coast Guard does not recommend it use.

Why Do You Need a PFD?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A PFD provides buoyancy to help keep your head above water and to help you stay face up. The average in-water-weight
of an adult is only about 5 to 10 pounds. The buoyancy provided by most PFDs will support that weight in water. However,
the hybrid Type I, II, or III PFD may be an exception. The uninflated buoyancy provided by this PFD may only float 90 percent
of the boating public. This is because the inherent buoyancy has been reduced to make it more comfortable to wear. So,
you may not float adequately without inflating the device. Once the device is inflated you will have a minimum of 22
lb of buoyancy for adult sizes, which is more than enough to float everyone. (See table above [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
below
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
] for the actual minimum buoyancy for different Types of hybrids.) Your body weight alone does not determine your in-water-weight.
Since there is no simple method of determining your weight in water, you should try the device in the water in both it's
deflated and inflated condition.

Wear Your PFD

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Your PFD won't help you if you don't have it on. It is well-known that most boating accidents occur on calm water during
a clear sunny day. It is also true that in approximately 80 percent of all boating accident fatalities, the victim did
not use a PFD. Don't wait until it's too late. Non-swimmers and children especially should wear their PFD at all times
when on or near the water. Hybrid Type I, II, III or V PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless inflated enough
to float the wearer.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on Incoming Publications in order to
require that inmates in medium security, high security, and administrative institutions may receive softcover
publications only from the publisher, book club, or bookstore. Current regulations allow for these items to be received
from any source. The proposed amendment also allows for the Warden to make an exception to this requirement and to the
existing similar requirement for hardcover publications and newspapers. This change is being proposed in order
to simplify security procedures designed to prevent the introduction of contraband into Bureau institutions. Provisions
in the Bureau's regulations on Inmate Legal Activities which restate the Bureau's policy on receipt of incoming publications
would be modified accordingly as a conforming amendment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on Incoming Publications. A final rule on this subject
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38260) and was amended December 7, 1982 (47 FR 55129) and January 3, 1985 (50 FR 410). A conforming
amendment would be made to the Bureau's regulations on Inmate Legal Activities. A final rule on this subject was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38263) and was amended December 4, 1981 (46 FR 59509) and July 23, 1990 (55 FR 29992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 540.71 allow an inmate to receive paperback books and magazines from any source. This
proposed amendment would require that at medium security, high security, and administrative institutions all softcover
publications may be received only from the publisher, book club, or book store. This would simplify Bureau procedures
designed to prevent the introduction of contraband into Bureau institutions and would allow for more efficient use
of Bureau staff and resources. In addition, this amendment would allow the Warden to make an exception when a publication
is no longer available from the publisher, book club, or bookstore. In such cases, the Warden may require that the inmate
provide written documentation that the publication is no longer available from these sources. The approval or disapproval
of any request is to be documented in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau regulations on Inmate Legal Activities restate in &sect;543.11(d) the policy on receipt of incoming publications.
As a conforming amendment, &sect;543.11(d) is also revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12886,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing
to the Bureau of Prisons, 320 First Street, NW., HOLC Room 754, Washington, DC 20534. Comments received during the
comment period will be considered before final action is taken. All comments received remain on file for public inspection
at the above address. The proposed rule may be changed in light of the comments received. No oral hearings are contemplated.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations for Institutional Eligibility under the Higher Education Act of
1965, as amended (HEA), and the regulations for Eligibility of Foreign Medical Schools under the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program (GSLP) to reflect changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The Secretary proposes
to remove the latter regulations from title 34 of the Code of Regulations, revise them, and add them to the former regulations,
as a new subpart E. The proposed regulations would revise the procedures and criteria under which a foreign institution
establishes eligibility to apply to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs if the institution
is comparable to an eligible institution of higher education located in the United States.

Negotiated Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 492 of the HEA contains procedural requirements that the Secretary is to follow in developing proposed regulations
required for changes made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325) to parts B, G, and H of title
IV of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 492(a) required the Secretary to convene regional meetings to gain public input on the content of proposed
regulations. Participants at those meetings were to include individuals and representatives of the groups involved
in the student financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the HEA, such as students, legal assistance
organizations that represent students, institutions of higher education, guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agencies. During
the meetings, the Secretary was to provide for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning
the implementation of the amendments made by Public Law 102&hyph;325 to parts B, G, and H, and was to take information
received at the meetings into account in the development of proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the regional meetings, the Secretary was to draft and submit regulations implementing the amendments
made to parts B, G, and H to a negotiated rulemaking process. Participants in the negotiations process were to be chosen
by the Secretary from individuals nominated by groups participating in the regional meetings and were to reflect
the diversity and sizes of organizations providing financial aid services to both local areas and national markets.

In accordance with these requirements, the Secretary convened four regional meetings to discuss issues raised by
the 1992 Amendments to the Higher Education Act, including the eligibility of foreign institutions to apply to participate
in the FFEL programs. The primary issues considered in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings were: the general criteria needed for the Secretary to determine the eligibility of institutions outside
the United States, how the Secretary should determine whether a foreign institution is comparable to an eligible
institution of higher education in the United States, and the appropriate method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating examination ``pass rates'' of students or graduates of foreign graduate medical schools. (These pass
rates are among a number of statutory requirements for determining the eligibility of foreign graduate medical schools.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings were held in New York, New York; San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri,
during the month of September 1992. Participants in the meetings were invited to nominate individuals to serve as
negotiators in the negotiated rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking into account views expressed at the regional meetings, the Department prepared draft proposed regulations
on the 1992 Amendments. The draft regulations were negotiated during the negotiated rulemaking sessions. The negotiators
reached general agreement on the content of the draft regulations relating to the eligibility of foreign institutions
to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the significant changes made by these proposed regulations to current regulations follows.

Summary of Proposed Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.51 (current &sect;601.1) Purpose and scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to revise the purpose and scope of proposed subpart E to remove the provisions that exempt from
these regulations medical schools in Canada or other foreign countries, if those schools are accredited by a nationally
recognized accrediting agency that accredits medical schools in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. This change is necessary because of the statutory change to section 481 of the HEA that requires every foreign
institution to be subject to all of the applicable criteria for determining the eligibility of foreign institutions.
Accreditation by a nationally recognized accrediting agency is still among the criteria in proposed &sect;600.55(a)(4)(ii)
for a public or private nonprofit foreign medical school to be eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs
(see the discussion under that section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.52 (current &sect;601.2) Definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would define a foreign institution as one that is not located in a State, and would revise the definition
of a foreign graduate medical school to require medical schools in Canada to be subject to proposed subpart E of 34 CFR
part 600. These changes reflect statutory changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also would define a secondary school as one that provides secondary education under the laws of the country
in which the school is located. This definition is needed for purposes of establishing compliance with criteria in
&sect;600.54 governing a foreign institution's admission policies and level of educational program offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.53 (current &sect;601.3) Requesting an eligibility determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to require a foreign institution to provide, release, or authorize the release to the Secretary
of the information that would be required in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart. The failure to provide that information would render the institution ineligible to participate in the FFEL
programs. These provisions restate the statutory requirement in section 481(a)(2)(C) of the HEA. With regard to
the provision of performance data that would be required in &sect;600.55 on examinations administered by the Educational
Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), the ECFMG initially informed the Secretary that it would study
the issue. Subsequently, the ECFMG indicated that it is unwilling to furnish this data directly to the Secretary.
Consequently, the Secretary proposes to require applicant institutions to furnish the data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the Secretary to comply with the statutory mandate to consider the pass rates on those exams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to require a foreign institution seeking initial or continued eligibility to apply for
a determination of that eligibility on a form prescribed by the Secretary, rather than permitting a student to apply
on behalf of the institution, as is currently the case. This change is necessary because of the statutory change requiring
an institution to furnish applicable information. However, a student would still be able to inform the Secretary
of his or her desire to seek an FFEL program loan for attendance at a foreign institution. The Secretary would then contact
the institution and supply the institution with application forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.54 Criteria for determining whether a foreign institution is eligible to apply to participate
in the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would contain the criteria that the Secretary would use to determine whether a foreign institution is
eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. To be eligible, a foreign institution would have to admit as
regular students only persons who have a credential for completion of secondary school or the recognized equivalent
of that credential. The institution would have to be legally authorized to provide a postsecondary educational program.
The institution would have to provide an eligible educational program that leads to a legally authorized degree equivalent
to an associate, bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree awarded in the United States, would have to be at least
a two-academic-year program acceptable for full credit toward the equivalent of a bachelor's degree awarded in the
United States, or would have to be equivalent to at least a one-academic-year training program in the United States
that leads to a certificate, degree, or other recognized educational credential and prepares students for gainful
employment in a recognized occupation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the criteria of this section would be parallel to those required of institutions of higher education, the
Secretary proposes to adopt the criteria for purposes of determining that a foreign institution is comparable to
an institution of higher education in the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.55 (current &sect;601.4) Additional criteria for determining whether a foreign graduate medical
school is eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the criteria in current &sect;601.4 a requirement for a foreign graduate medical
school to employ as faculty members only those with academic credentials equivalent to credentials required of faculty
members teaching the same or similar courses in the United States. The Secretary considers this requirement necessary
for determining the comparability of foreign graduate medical schools to medical schools in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to replace the current requirement in &sect;601.4(e) concerning the pass rate of students
and graduates of foreign graduate medical schools on ECFMG examinations with new requirements. The new requirements
are mandated by the changes to section 481(a)(2) of the HEA. Under those statutory changes, for the year preceding
the year in which any of a foreign graduate medical school's students seeks a loan under the FFEL programs, generally
at least 60 percent of the school's enrolled students and 60 percent of its graduates must have been neither citizens
nor nationals of the United States nor eligible noncitizens for purposes of the title IV, HEA programs. Further, for
the year preceding the year in which any of the school's students seeks a loan under the FFEL programs, generally at
least 60 percent of the school's students or graduates taking ECFMG examinations must have received a passing score
on those examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary, in implementing these requirements, proposes several clarifications to ensure the statistical
accuracy and uniformity of a foreign graduate medical school's calculations. For purposes of the calculation concerning
the citizenship of the school's students and graduates, the school would count only those enrolled students who are
full-time regular students. The Secretary believes that it is necessary to restrict this calculation to full-time
regular students to prevent institutions from enrolling a significant number of part-time students who are not seeking
a degree or certificate in order to obtain the required percentage. The school would count as graduates only those
from its most recent graduating class during the academic year preceding the year for which the calculation is performed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the calculation concerning the pass rate of the school's students and graduates, the school would
count all enrolled students, regardless of their enrollment status or their regular student status. The Secretary
believes that it is appropriate to count all enrolled students or graduates in the pass rate calculations in order
to obtain a larger sample, thereby ensuring statistical accuracy and validity. A second reason to include all enrolled
students in the pass rate calculation is that the statute requires the Secretary to consider the pass rate on the examinations
administered by the ECFMG as a measure of comparability to medical schools located in the United States. Performance
on the examinations administered by the ECFMG reflects both the quality of the education at the foreign medical school
and the knowledge of the individual student who takes the examination. Thus, it is appropriate to include the scores
of all students in this calculation to fully reflect the comparability of the institution and its students and graduates
to medical schools located in the United States. The Secretary also notes that the statute did not expressly exclude
any students from calculation of the pass rate. The school would count as graduates those persons who graduated from
the school during the three years preceding the year for which the calculation is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ECFMG examinations are administered separately in two steps: Step 1 includes basic medical sciences and Step
2 includes the clinical sciences. A person may take each step in different years. In addition, the ECFMG administers
an English test for purposes of satisfying the requirement for demonstrating English language competency to obtain
ECFMG certification. Therefore, the Secretary would require the school's calculation for any year to include any
student or graduate who took any step of the ECFMG examinations, including the English test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 481(a)(2) of the HEA exempts from both of the above calculations a foreign graduate medical school whose clinical
program has been approved by a State as of January 1, 1992. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would include this exemption, but would further require the school's clinical program to maintain current
State approval. The Secretary believes that this additional requirement is necessary to establish that a school
that does not meet the applicable minimum percentages at least has a clinical program comparable to one provided by
an eligible institution of higher education in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also would require a foreign graduate medical school to be accredited by an accrediting body legally
authorized to evaluate the quality of graduate medical school educational programs and facilities in the school's
country. The accreditation standards used by that accrediting body would have to be evaluated by an advisory panel
of medical experts appointed by the Secretary and that panel would have to determine if those standards are comparable
to those used for accrediting medical schools in the United States. A public or nonprofit school that is not accredited
would have to be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency designated by the Secretary. (Currently,
the Secretary recognizes the Liaison Committee on Medical Education for the accreditation of programs leading to
the M.D. degree.) These accreditation requirements are mandated by the changes to section 481(a)(2) of the HEA.

Proposed &sect;600.56 (current &sect;&sect;601.6 and 601.7)&blank;Duration of eligibility determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to provide for the expiration of a foreign institution's eligibility after four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, unless the Secretary specifies a shorter period of eligibility. Currently, a foreign institution's eligibility
generally expires after two years. The Secretary proposes this change to allow for treatment of foreign institutions
consistent with that for institutions in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to provide for the continued eligibility of a foreign graduate medical school to be contingent
upon the school's annual submission of the information in &sect;600.55 concerning the school's enrollment and pass
rate on ECFMG examinations. Currently, a foreign graduate medical school's eligibility is not terminated solely
because of a failure to maintain the specified pass rate. The Secretary proposes to make this change to conform to changes
made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to provide for the continued eligibility of an otherwise eligible student for loans under
the FFEL programs for up to an academic year after the academic year in which a foreign institution loses eligibility,
if the student received an FFEL program loan for attendance at the institution while the institution was eligible.
This change would merely reflect statutory changes made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992.

 The Secretary proposes to remove this section, which governed the eligibility of certain students for loans under
the FFEL programs before the publication date of the current regulations (February 25, 1983). This section is no longer
needed.

The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small entities affected by these regulations are small foreign institutions. However, the regulations would
not have a significant economic impact on the small institutions affected because the regulations would not impose
excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal
burdens necessary to implement statutory requirements.

Section &sect;600.53 contains information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of this section to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations affect businesses or other for-profit entities and nonprofit institutions that participate
in the FFEL programs. The Secretary needs to collect this information to enable the Secretary to enforce the statutory
provisions for determining the eligibility of foreign institutions to apply to participate in the FFEL programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average three hours per response
for 1,100 institutions, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 203 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended, directs the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to ``carry
out a program to encourage the development, maintenance and expansion of commercial export markets for agricultural
commodities through cost-share assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign market development
program.'' Assistance under this program may be provided in the form of funds of, or commodities owned by, the CCC,
as determined appropriate by the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MPP will be implemented in accordance with the regulations set forth in 7 CFR part 1485, subpart B, (56 FR 40745), August
16, 1991, as revised by the interim rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60549). The Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), who is Vice President
of CCC, is authorized to enter into agreements with nonprofit trade associations, regional associations of state
departments of agriculture, state groups, and U.S. private firms and cooperatives to provide cost-share assistance
to carry-out approved export promotion activities. Eligibility for promotional support will be limited to those
agricultural commodities or products which are at least 50 percent U.S. origin by weight, excluding added water.
Except for activities conducted by small-sized entities operating through state groups, promotional activities
will only be undertaken to counter or offset the adverse effects of a subsidy, import quota, or other unfair trade practice
of a foreign country, through cost-share assistance, in order to encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion
of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and products. Assistance may be provided for brand
promotion activities when such activities are determined by the Administrator, FAS, to be an effective means of carrying
out the purposes of the MPP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be considered by CCC, applicants must fully comply with the procedures specified in 7 CFR part 1485. Criteria for
the allocation of CCC resources in the MPP are set forth in 7 CFR 1485.15.

The applicant must provide the information required by 7 CFR part 1485 and may include any other factors the applicant

An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing
Corporation, U.S.A. (KMM), operator of FTZ Subzone 59A, at the KMM manufacturing facilities, Lincoln, Nebraska,
requesting authority to manufacture utility work trucks under zone procedures. The application was submitted pursuant
to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the
Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on January 10, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subzone 59A was approved by the FTZ Board in 1980 with activity granted for the manufacture of motorcycles, jet skis,
and four wheel all terrain vehicles (Board Order 163, 45 FR 58637, 9&hyph;4&hyph;80). An application for expansion
of the subzone is currently pending (Doc. 56&hyph;93, 58 FR 63335, 12&hyph;1&hyph;93). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KMM is now requesting subzone authority for the manufacture of certain off-road, gasoline engine utility work trucks
(called ``Mules'') (payload capacity up to 1,200 pounds) for the U.S. market and export. Foreign-sourced components
and subassemblies comprise approximately 40 percent of the finished vehicles' material value and include: engines,
transmissions, calipers, wheels, and tires (duty rate range: free&hyph;15.4%). All steel mill products will be
sourced domestically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zone procedures would exempt KMM from Customs duty payments on the foreign components used in export production.
On its domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales, the company would be able to choose the duty rate that applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the finished work trucks (HTSUS
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 8709.19.0030, duty free) for the foreign components noted above. The application indicates that the savings from
zone procedures would help improve KMM's international competitiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the
application and report to the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is on March
21, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(c), the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review
of exports to the United States for the period June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992 (57 FR 32521) on July 22, 1992, and for
the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993 (58 FR 39007) on July 21, 1993. On December 22, 1993, Magyar Gordulocsapagy
Muvek (MGM) and the Timken Company, the Petitioner, jointly asked the Department to terminate these reviews, stating
that both parties sought to conserve resources, and MGM withdrew its requests for reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), ``the Secretary may permit a party that requests a review under paragraph
(a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than ninety days after the date of publication of notice of initiation
of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides that it is reasonable to
do so.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the circumstances in which no interested party objects to the request for termination, we believe that it is
reasonable to extend the ninety-day time limit governing the withdrawal of requests for administrative reviews.
Thus, in view of MGM's and Timken's request of December 22, 1993, the Department is terminating these reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These terminations are in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 9, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final results of administrative reviews of the antidumping finding on tapered roller bearings, four inches or
less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan, and the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings
and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, from Japan. The reviews of the finding covered the periods from August
1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1992. The reviews of the order covered
the periods from October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent to the publication of the final results, the Department discovered that it had made a ministerial error
affecting the margins for Nachi-Fujikoshi. The Department also discovered ministerial errors affecting the margins
for NSK Ltd., Koyo Seiko, and NTN Corporation; however, since appeals have already been filed by these parties, we
are precluded from correcting these errors at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have corrected the error affecting Nachi by assigning to Nachi in the A&hyph;588&hyph;604 reviews of both periods
the proper rate to be used as best information available (BIA), 40.37 percent.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 9, 1993, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final results of its 1990&hyph;91 and 1991&hyph;92 administrative review of the antidumpting finding on tapered
roller bearings, four inches or less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan, and the antidumping
duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, from Japan (58 FR 64720). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the final results, the Department discovered that it had made a ministerial error
affecting Nachi. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 353.28(d) of the Department's regulations defines a ``ministerial error'' as ``an error in addition, subtraction,
or other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any
other type of unintentional error which the Secretary considers ministerial'' (19 CFR 353.28(d)). Although Nachi
submitted comments on November 1, 1993, concerning the rate it should receive as BIA in the A&hyph;588&hyph;604 reviews,
the Department inadvertently failed to address these comments in the final results. Nachi pointed out that the rate
of 45.95 percent, which the Department assigned to Nachi in the final results, is a rate from a previous review of the
order which was later amended to correct clerical errors. We agree with Nachi, and have assigned, as BIA, a rate of 40.37
percent to Nachi in both reviews of the A&hyph;588&hyph;604 case.

Amended Final Results of Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of this correction, we have determined that the rate for Nachi is 40.37 percent for tapered roller bearings
and components thereof (A&hyph;588&hyph;604) for the periods October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October
1, 1991 through September 30, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between the United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated
above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the following cash deposit requirements are amended as follows: A&hyph;588&hyph;604: Nachi 40.37
percent. All other cash deposit requirements remain unchanged from the notice of December 9, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until the publication of the final results of the next administrative
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to the final results of administrative reviews and this notice are in accordance with section 751(f)
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and section 353.28(c) of the Department's regulations (19
CFR 353.28(c)).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Commerce is charged with the responsibility of discharging the obligations of the United States
under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946. This authority has been delegated to the
Under Secretary of NOAA. The U.S. Commissioner to the IWC has primary responsibility for the preparation and negotiation
of U.S. positions on international issues concerning whaling and for all matters involving the IWC. He is staffed
by the Department of Commerce, and assisted by the Department of State, the Department of the Interior, the Marine
Mammal Commission, and other interested agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year, NOAA conducts a series of meetings and other actions to prepare for the annual meeting of the IWC, which is
usually held in the spring or summer. The major purpose of the preparatory meetings is to provide for input in the development
of policy by members of the public and non-governmental organizations interested in whale conservation. NOAA believes
that this participation is important for the effective development and implementation of U.S. policy concerning
whaling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person with an identifiable interest in United States whale conservation policy may participate in the meetings,
but NOAA reserves the authority to inquire about the interest of any person who appears at a meeting and to determine
the appropriateness of that person's participation. Foreign nationals and persons who represent foreign governments
may not attend. These stringent measures are necessary to promote the candid exchange of information. Such measures
are a necessary basis for the relatively open process of preparing for IWC meetings that characterizes current practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tentative schedule of meetings and deadlines, including those of the IWC and deadlines for the preparation of
position papers during 1994 is as follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At its 1993 Annual Meeting, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) unanimously
recommended that the Commission adopt a specific Revised Management Procedure (RMP), including a method for calculating
catch quotas for commercial whaling_the ``catch limit algorithn'' (CLA). As part of the U.S. evaluation of the proposed
procedure, NMFS conducted an independent scientific peer review of the RMP and its CLA during October 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This review assessed the performance and applicability of the RMP as a management tool by considering the rationale
used to develop the RMP, the simulation trials conducted by the IWC's Scientific Committee, and the structure and
content of the various components of the RMP as a means of addressing the stated goals of the IWC. In addition, the review
addressed the data requirements for a monitoring program to assess the performance of the RMP, as was discussed by
the IWC at its 1993 Annual Meeting in Kyoto, Japan. The review did not address any other questions related to commercial
whaling or whaling policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel concluded that the Catch Limit Algorithm (CLA) appears to be robust and conservative in meeting the stated
goals of the Commission in so far as the simulation trials that have been made to date are concerned. In the Panel's opinion,
the testing procedure used is a valid one and the set of statistical standards used was adequate. The Panel concluded
that, provided the required protocol of implementation trials and reviews is followed, the CLA could safely be used
for a short period of time, after which a thorough review would be needed. However, the Panel also agreed that the range
of simulation trials that have been made to date is not yet sufficiently extensive, in several regards, so as to gain
its full confidence. It therefore recommended that additional robustness trials be made as part of the implementation
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the results of the peer review, the preliminary view of the National Marine Fisheries Services is that it would
seem reasonable from a scientific point of view for the IWC to adopt the RMP in principle, but that no quotas should be
calculated until the additional implementation trials called for by the peer review panel are completed.

NTIS invites representatives of federal agencies to attend an open briefing and discussion covering the procedures,
definitions, roles, and benefits of a newly published regulation covering the transfer of Federal scientific, technical,
and engineering information (STEI). The briefing will be held at the Department of Commerce, Herbert C. Hoover Building,
room 4830, on January 26, 1994, 2 to 4 p.m.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 108 of the American Technology Preeminence Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;245) requires all federal agencies to transfer
Government-financed STEI to the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). The final rule establishing procedures
to be used was published in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Vol. 15, No. 1, January 3, 1994, pp 6&hyph;12) as 15 CFR part 1180. The procedures become effective on February 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Act is to promote the national economic competitiveness of the United States and to help U.S. industries
speed the development of new products and processes. Centralized availability of Government-sponsored STEI to
industry, as well as to other users, is an important means toward this end. NTIS was created for this purpose in 1950.
Until now, the transfer of federal STEI products to NTIS was voluntary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent policy statements have stressed the need for better dissemination of Government information, including
the President's report on Technology for America's Economic Growth and the June 1993 release of OMB Circular A&hyph;130.
The latter makes dissemination of information a responsibility of each Government agency. The procedures established
in the new regulation can aid Federal agencies to meet their obligations under these policies as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting is open to all Federal employees, but attendance is limited to 75 persons. Persons interested in attending
should contact Mr. Walter L. Finch, Associate Director for Business Development, NTIS, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,
VA 22161 (telephone: 703&hyph;487&hyph;4674). Additional briefings will be scheduled if needed.

of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following: (1) Type
of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection;
(4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance is established under section 491 of the Higher Education
Act of 1965 as amended by Public Law 100&hyph;50 (20 U.S.C. 1098). The Advisory Committee is established to provide
advice and counsel to the Congress and the Secretary of Education on student financial aid matters, including providing
technical expertise with regard to systems of need analysis and application forms, making recommendations that
will result in the maintenance of access to postsecondary education for low- and middle-income students, conducting
a study of institutional lending in the Stafford Student Loan Program, and assisting with activities related to reauthorization
of the Higher Education Act of 1965. As a result of the passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, the Congress
has directed the Advisory Committee to assist with a series of special assessments and conduct an in-depth study of
student loan simplification. Also, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 directed the Advisory Committee
to conduct an evaluation of the Direct Lending and FFEL programs and submit a report to Congress and the Secretary of
Education on an annual basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed agenda includes: (a) A discussion on evaluating the Direct Lending and FFEL programs; (b) an update on
the delivery system; (c) an update on other ED initiatives; and (d) an Advisory Committee regulatory update and planning
session for the upcoming year's agenda.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Advisory Committee will meet in Washington, DC on January 31, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on February 1, from
8:30 a.m. to 12 noon. The meeting will be closed to the public from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. to elect a new chairman and discuss
other personnel matters. The ensuing discussions will relate to internal personnel rules and practices of an agency
and will disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy if conducted in open session. Such matters are protected by exemptions (2) and (6) of Section 552(b)(c)
of title 5 U.S.C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the activities at the closed session and related matters which are informative to the public consistent
with the policy of title 5 U.S.C. 552(b) will be available to the public within fourteen days of the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records are kept of all Committee proceedings, and are available for public inspection at the Office of the Advisory
Committee on Student Financial Assistance, room 4600, 7th and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC from the hours of 9 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m., weekdays, except federal holidays.

Take notice that on January 7, 1994 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) tendered for filing as part
of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute Original Sheet No. 2490, to be effective January 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that the filing is being made in compliance with the Commission's December 29, 1993 letter order in this
proceeding. On December 1, 1993, TGPL submitted tariff sheets establishing a new Rate Schedule NS and associated
Form of Service Agreement, to make unbundled sales under its Order No. 636 blanket sales certificate. The December
29 letter order accepted such tariff sheets, subject to modification, to become effective on January 1, 1994. One
of the potential points of delivery described in Rate Schedule NS, as filed, was ``any point on another interstate
or intrastate pipeline''. In the December 29 letter order, the Commission found that this language ``could be interpreted
to permit (TGPL) to transport its sales gas through its system and make the sale after a delivery to a downstream LDC
or other pipeline.'' The Commission further found that ``such an interpretation, whether intentional or not, would
be inconsistent with Order No. 636.'' The December 29 letter order, therefore, required TGPL to modify Section 4 of
Rate Schedule NS to add to the point of sale definition, part (b), the language ``prior to entry into Seller's pipeline
system.'' TGPL states that Substitute Original Sheet No. 249&hyph;O reflects such modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that it is serving copies of the filing on its customers, State Commissions and other interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825

The FDIC is submitting for OMB review changes to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)

The revisions to the Call Reports that are the subject of this request were approved by the FFIEC on December 16, 1993,
and are scheduled to take effect as of March 31, 1994. Unless otherwise indicated, these Call Report changes apply
to all four sets of report forms (FFIEC 031, 032, 033, and 034). Nonetheless, as is customary for Call Report changes,
banks will be advised that they may provide reasonable estimates for any of the new items in their March 31, 1994, Call

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Revisions to the reporting of securities in the following Call Report schedules to reflect the effect of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities''
(FASB 115), which banks must adopt for Call Report purposes for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In the body of Schedule RC&hyph;B, ``Securities,'' the amortized cost and fair value for each type of held-to-maturity
securities would be reported separately from the amortized cost and fair value for each type of available-for-sale
securities. On the FFIEC 031 report forms only, the breakdown of securities (not held in trading accounts) in domestic
offices by type of security would be moved from the body of Schedule RC&hyph;B to Schedule RC&hyph;H, ``Selected Balance
Sheet Items for Domestic Offices.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the Memoranda section of Schedule RC&hyph;B, Memorandum items 3, ``Taxable securities issued by states and
political subdivisions in the U.S.,'' and 5, ``Debt securities held for sale,'' would be deleted. A new Memorandum
item would be added for the amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities sold or transferred during the calendar
year-to-date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) On Schedule RC, ``Balance Sheet,'' item 2, ``Securities,'' would be split into separate items for ``Available-for-sale
securities'' and ``Held-to-maturity securities,'' while item 26.b would be recaptioned as ``Net unrealized holding
gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) On Schedule RI, ``Income Statement,'' item 6, ``Gains (losses) on securities not held in trading accounts,''
would be split into separate items for realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity
securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) On Schedule RI&hyph;A, ``Changes in Equity Capital,'' item 11 would be recaptioned as ``Change in net unrealized
holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On Schedule RC&hyph;M, ``Memoranda,'' new items would be added for the amount of mutual funds (segregated into
four categories) and annuities sold during the quarter by the reporting bank and by third parties with whom the bank
has a contractual sales arrangement. In Schedule RI, ``Income Statement,'' a Memorandum item would be added for fee
income from the sale and servicing of mutual funds and annuities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On Schedule RC, ``Balance Sheet,'' item 16 for ``Other borrowed money'' would be split into separate subitems
for amounts with an original maturity of one year or less and for amounts with an original maturity of more than one year.
In addition, a new category of liabilities, ``Trading liabilities,'' would begin to be reported on Schedule RC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On Schedule RC&hyph;O, ``Other Data for Deposit Insurance Assessments,'' a new item would be added for ``Benefit-Responsive
`Depository Institution Investment Contracts'.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On the FFIEC 031 and 032 report forms only:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Schedule RC&hyph;D would be revised to cover both trading assets and liabilities, including new items for three
categories of mortgage-backed securities, trading assets in foreign offices (on the FFIEC 031 report forms), revaluation
gains (broken down between domestic offices and foreign offices on the FFIEC 031) and revaluation losses on interest
rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity and equity contracts, and liability for short positions. In addition
to the banks with $1 billion or more in total assets that are currently required to complete Schedule RC&hyph;D, those
banks with $2 billion or more in par/notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity
and equity contracts (and less than $1 billion in total assets) will be required to complete the schedule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Schedule RC&hyph;N, which collects past due and nonaccrual data, would see the addition of new items for interest
rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity and equity contracts that are past due 30 through 89 days or past due
90 days or more. Banks would report the book value of amounts carried as assets on the balance sheet for such past due
contracts as well as the replacement cost of those past due contracts with a positive replacement cost. Consistent
with the existing treatment of Schedule RC&hyph;N data, individual bank information on contracts past due 30 through
89 days would be treated as confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) On Schedule RC&hyph;C, part I, ``Loans and Leases,'' a single total would be reported for ``Obligations (other
than securities and leases) of states and political subdivisions in the U.S.'' and the separate items for taxable
and tax-exempt obligations would be eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Memorandum items 1 and 2 on Schedule RC&hyph;L, ``Off-Balance Sheet Items,'' which collect data on certain loan
sales and purchases during the quarter would be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the general Call Report instruction precluding assets and liabilities from being offset or otherwise
netted unless specifically required by the instructions would be modified to allow on-balance sheet amounts associated
with conditional and exchange contracts (e.g., forwards, interest rate swaps, and options) to be offset in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39. This would be an interim treatment pending clarification
of an interpretive issue under Interpretation No. 39.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The drug export provisions in section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 382) provide
that FDA may approve applications for the export of drugs that are not currently approved in the United States. Section
802(b)(3)(B) of the act sets forth the requirements that must be met in an application for approval. Section 802(b)(3)(C)
of the act requires that the agency review the application within 30 days of its filing to determine whether the requirements
of section 802(b)(3)(B) have been satisfied. Section 802(b)(3)(A) of the act requires that the agency publish a notice
in the Federal Register within 10 days of the filing of an application for export to facilitate public participation
in its review of the application. To meet this requirement, the agency is providing notice that Merck Research Laboratories,
Division of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ 07065, has filed an application requesting approval for the export of
the bulk animal drug substance abamectin to the Netherlands where it will be further exported to Australia or New Zealand
either as the bulk material or as the formulated injectable product. The drug is administered to cattle for control
of certain internal and external parasites. The application was received and filed in the Center for Veterinary Medicine
on December 30, 1993, which shall be considered the filing date for purposes of the act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Title 43, CFR 8340 and in conformance with principles established by the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, the logging roads mentioned above are gated and closed to all motorized vehicle traffic. Careful
review and analysis in cooperation with the Idaho Fish and Game Department, country governments, and the public has
determined that unrestricted use of these roads by motorized vehicle traffic will significantly reduce habitat
effectiveness for upland and big game in already heavily roaded areas. All road closure(s) contained herein serve
to mitigate impacts resulting from salvage timber sales. Copies of maps indicating these road closures are posted
at the Deep Creek and Pocatello Resource Area Offices of the Idaho Bureau of Land Management. These closures are not
restricted to authorized Bureau of Land Management personnel and permitees or Idaho Fish and Game Department personnel.
This closure applies to approximately 15 miles of logging road constructed on four separate timber salvage sales.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic leasing policies for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Areas were established a little more
than a decade ago. Since that time, many of the conditions facing the OCS program have changed, and MMS and the Department
of the Interior are re-evaluating leasing policies for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico sales remaining under
the Comprehensive OCS Natural Gas and Oil Resource Management Program for 1992&hyph;1997. Comments will be considered
for sales to be held subsequent to Sale 147, which is planned for Spring 1994, and will be factored into studies to determine
the effectiveness of the existing system of leasing and what alternatives are most appropriate. Neither MMS nor the
Department of the Interior has preferred alternatives, and no decisions have been made to change the existing leasing
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several parties have requested that the comment period be extended by 60 days. Upon consideration of these requests,
MMS has decided that an extension of 30 days, to a total of 92 days, is appropriate. This Call for Public Comment is only
part of a continuing opportunity for correspondence and dialog between MMS and interested parties, and it should
be noted that the decision process for individual sales explicitly includes consideration of comments from outside
parties.

RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) has filed a notice of exemption to acquire control, through stock purchase, of South
Central Tennessee Railroad Company (SCTR), a class III rail carrier which operates over approximately 50 miles of
rail line in the vicinity 40 miles west of Nashville, TN, extending from Colesburg Yard, TN (at milepost 2.9) where
it interchanges with CSX Transportation, to Hohenwald, TN (at milepost 52.1).

RailAmerica indicates that: (1) The lines operated by SCTR do not connect with any rail lines operated by HESR or SGVY,
or its corporate family; (2) the involved transaction is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would
connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve
a class I carrier. The transaction is therefore exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See
49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). The purpose of the transaction is to preserve rail service on a light density rail line. RailAmerica
anticipates that it will be able to attract more rail service to the line than is presently being provided by offering
lower costs, more frequent service, and an increased car supply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civ. A. No. HAR&hyph;89&hyph;2869, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint filed by the United States in October 1989 seeks to recover past, unreimbursed costs under Section 107
of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9607, incurred
by the United States in connection with response actions taken at the Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone Superfund Site
(``Site'') located in Elkton, Maryland. Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone Company, (``Maryland Sand Company'') the
owner and operator of the Site, was sued along with four other defendants. The proposed decree represents a partial
settlement of this case, resolving only the United States' claims for past response costs against the Maryland Sand
Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this consent decree, the Maryland Sand Company will pay the United States $25,000 in partial reimbursement
of the United States' unrecovered past response costs. The settlement is based on a demonstration by Maryland Sand
Company of its inability to reimburse the United States for any additional response costs. Under the terms of the decree,
Maryland Sand Company will also provide the United States and its representatives, including the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, access to the Site for purposes of conducting and overseeing CERCLA response activities. The
United States has specifically reserved its right to seek further relief from Maryland Sand Company on claims for
future response costs, and for claims for natural resource damages, criminal liability and other claims that are
outside of the scope of the complaint filed in this case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed consent decree for a period of thirty days
from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O. Box 7611, Ben Franklin Station, Washington,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)&hyph;(h), that a proposed
Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States of America 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Baroid Corporation; Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc.; DB Stratabit (USA) Inc.; and Dresser Industries Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint of the United States in this case alleges that the merger of Dresser Industries, Inc. (``Dresser'')
and Baroid Corporation (``Baroid'') may substantially lessen competition in the United States in the manufacture
and sale of drilling fluids and in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in violation of section 7 of the Clayton
Act. Both products are used to drill oil and gas wells. Drilling fluids, a mixture of natural and synthetic chemical
compounds, are used at petrocarbon drilling sites to improve the function of the drill bit and other drilling tools
in the well, including cooling and lubricating the drill bit and controlling downhole pressures. Diamond drill bits
cut through rock and other formations during drilling operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dresser, through its 64% partnership interest in M&hyph;I Drilling Fluids Co., and Baroid, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc., are two of the three major U.S. producers of drilling fluids. In addition,
Dresser's Security Division and Baroid's wholly-owned subsidiary, DB Stratabit (USA) Inc., manufacture diamond
drill bits for sale in the United States. They are two of the five major competitors in the U.S. diamond drill bit market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest all of their direct and indirect ownership and control
of either Dresser's or Baroid's drilling fluid business by June 1, 1994. In addition, Defendants must, by July 1, 1994,
divest Baroid's diamond bit business, which includes a manufacturing facility, certain equipment, a nonexclusive
license of patents and other intellectual property to manufacture and sell steel-bodied diamond drill bits worldwide,
except in the People's Republic of China, and a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell matrix diamond bits in
the United States. If defendants do not complete the respective divestitures by the allotted time, a trustee or trustees
will be appointed to conduct either or both of the divestitures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Divestiture of Drilling Fluid Business
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Defendants are hereby ordered and directed to divest all of their direct and indirect ownership and control of the
drilling fluid business to a purchaser prior to June 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture prior to June 1, 1994, plaintiff may, in its sole discretion,
extend this time period for an additional period of time not to exceed one month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Defendants agree to take all reasonable steps to accomplish quickly said divestiture. In carrying out their obligation
to divest the drilling fluid business, defendants may divest these operations alone, or may divest along with these
operations any other assets of Baroid or Dresser. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, the defendants promptly shall make known in the
United States and in other major countries, by usual and customary means, the availability of the drilling fluid business,
for sale as an ongoing business. The defendants shall notify any person making an inquiry regarding the possible purchase
of this operation that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person with a copy of the
Final Judgment. The defendants shall also offer to furnish to all bona fide prospective purchasers of the drilling
fluid business, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all pertinent information regarding the drilling
fluid business, except information subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege. Defendants
shall make available such information to the plaintiff at the same time that such information is made available to
any other person. Defendants shall permit prospective purchasers of the drilling fluid business to have access to
personnel at the drilling fluid business and to make such inspection of physical facilities and any and all financial,
operational, or other documents and information as may be relevant to the sale of the drilling fluid business. Defendants
shall not be required to permit prospective purchasers to have access to any documents or information relevant to
the drilling fluid business, except to the extent included in the drilling fluid business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Divestiture required by section IV of the Final Judgment shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy plaintiff,
in its sole discretion, that the drilling fluid business can and will be operated by the purchaser as a viable, ongoing
business engaged in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States. Divestiture shall be made to
a purchaser for whom it is demonstrated to plaintiff's satisfaction that (1) the purchase is for the purpose of competing
effectively in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States, and (2) the purchaser has the managerial,
operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. The defendants shall not sell the drilling fluid business to Baker Hughes, Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., or Anchor Drilling
Fluids, or any of their affiliates of subsidiaries during the life of this decree. The purchaser of the divested drilling
fluid business shall not sell the drilling fluid business to, or combine that business with the drilling fluid operations
of, Dresser Industries, Inc., Baker Hughes, Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., or Anchor Drilling Fluids, or any of their affiliates

Divestiture of Baroid's Diamond Bit Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Defendants are hereby ordered and directed to divest to a purchaser prior to July 1, 1994 all of their direct and indirect
ownership and control of Baroid's diamond bit business. The obligation to divest shall be satisfied if, by July 1,
1994, defendants enter into a binding contract for sale of Baroid's diamond bit business to a purchaser according
to terms approved by plaintiff that is contingent only upon compliance with the terms of this Final Judgment and that
specifies a prompt and reasonable closing date no later than September 1, 1994, and if sale is completed pursuant to
the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture prior to July 1, 1994, plaintiff may, in its sole discretion,
extend this time period for an additional period of time not to exceed three months, if defendants request such an extension
and demonstrate to plaintiff's satisfaction that they are then engaged in negotiations with a prospective purchaser
that are likely to result in the required divestiture but that the divestiture cannot be completed prior to July 1,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Defendants agree to take all reasonable steps to accomplish quickly said divestiture. In carrying out their obligation
to divest Baroid's diamond bit business, defendants may divest these operations alone, or may divest along with these
operations any other assets of Baroid or Dresser. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, the defendants promptly shall make known in the
United States and in other major countries, by usual and customary means, the availability of Baroid's diamond bit
business, for sale as an ongoing business. The defendants shall notify any person making an inquiry regarding the
possible purchase of this operation that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person
with a copy of the Final Judgment. The defendants shall also offer to furnish to all bona fide prospective purchasers
of Baroid's diamond bit business, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all pertinent information
regarding Baroid's diamond bit business, except information subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney
work product privilege. Defendants shall make available such information to the plaintiff at the same time that such
information is made available to any other person. Defendants shall permit prospective purchasers of Baroid's diamond
bit business to have access to personnel at Baroid's diamond bit business and to make such inspection of physical facilities
and any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information as may be relevant to the sale of Baroid's
diamond bit business. Defendants shall not be required to permit prospective purchasers to have access to any documents
or information relevant to Dresser's diamond bit business, except to the extent included in Baroid's diamond bit
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Divestiture required by section V of the Final Judgment shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy plaintiff,
in its sole discretion, that Baroid's diamond bit business can and will be operated by the purchaser as a viable, ongoing
business engaged in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in the United States. Divestiture shall be made
to a purchaser for whom it is demonstrated to plaintiff's satisfaction that (1) the purchase is for the purpose of competing
effectively in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in the United States, including the ability to conduct
research, development, and testing of diamond bits, and (2) the purchaser has the managerial, operational, and financial
capability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. The defendants shall not sell Baroid's diamond bit business to Baker Hughes, Inc., Camco International, Inc.,
Smith International, Inc., or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries during the life of this decree. The purchaser
of Baroid's diamond bit business shall not sell that business to, or combine that business with the diamond drill bit
operations of, Dresser Industries, Inc., Baker Hughes, Inc., Camco, Inc., Smith International, Inc., or any of their
affiliates or subsidiaries during the life of this decree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Except to the extent otherwise approved by plaintiff, Baroid's diamond bit business divested pursuant to this
Final Judgment shall be divested free and clear of all mortgages, encumbrances and liens to Baroid or Dresser.

B. If defendants have not accomplished the divestiture required by section IV of this Final Judgment at the expiration

fluid business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. After the trustee's appointment has become effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the drilling

to the provisions of section VIII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court shall deem appropriate.
Defendants shall not object to a sale of the drilling fluids business by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's
malfeasance. Any such objection by defendants must be conveyed in writing to plaintiff and the trustee within fifteen
(15) days after the trustee has notified defendants of the proposed sale in accordance with section VIII of this Final
Judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, shall receive compensation based on a fee arrangement
providing an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished,
and shall serve on such other terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe; provided, however, that the trustee
shall receive no compensation, no incur any costs or expenses, prior to the effective date of his or her appointment.
The trustee shall account for all monies derived from a sale of the drilling fluid business and all costs and expenses
incurred in connection therewith. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its
services, all remaining monies shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture of
the drilling fluid business and shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture.
The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the drilling fluid
business, and defendants shall develop such financial or other information relevant to the drilling fluid business.

each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The
Court shall thereafter enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediately following entry of a binding contract, contingent upon compliance with the terms of this Final Judgment,
to effect any proposed divestiture pursuant to sections IV, V, VI, or VII of this Final Judgment, defendants or the
trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture, shall notify plaintiff of the proposed divestiture.
If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the
proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who
offered to, or expressed an interest in or desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the business that is the subject
of the binding contract, together with full details of same. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt by plaintiff of such
notice, plaintiff may request additional information concerning the proposed divestiture and the proposed purchaser.
Defendants and/or the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within twenty (20) days of the
receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice
or within twenty (20) days after plaintiff has been provided the additional information requested (including any
additional information requested of persons other than defendants or the trustee), whichever is later, plaintiff
shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the
proposed divestiture. If plaintiff provides written notice to defendants and/or the trustee that it does not object,
then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under the
provisions in sections VI(C) and VII(C). Absent written notice that the plaintiff does not object to the proposed
purchaser, a divestiture proposed under Section IV shall not be consummated. Upon objection by plaintiff, a divestiture
proposed under section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by plaintiff, or by defendants under the proviso
in sections VI(C) and VII(C), a divestiture proposed under section VI or VII shall not be consummated unless approved
by the Court.

A. The defendants shall take all steps necessary to assure that DBS and Baroid Drilling will be maintained as separate
and independent, economically viable, ongoing businesses with their assets (including proprietary technology,
management, operations, and books and records) separate, distinct and apart from those of Dresser. The defendants
shall use all reasonable efforts on behalf of DBS to maintain and increase sales of diamond drill bits, continue its
current plans for research, development, and testing of diamond drill bits, and otherwise maintain the business
as a viable and active competitor in the United States. The defendants shall use all reasonable efforts on behalf of
Baroid Drilling and M&hyph;I Drilling Fluids Co. to maintain and increase sales of drilling fluids, continue current
plans for research, development, and testing of drilling fluids, and otherwise maintain the businesses as viable
and active competitors in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The defendants shall not sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or pledge as collateral for loans
(except such loans as are currently outstanding or replacements of substitutes therefore), assets required to be
divested pursuant to sections IV, V, VI, or VII except that any component of such assets as is replaced in the ordinary
course of business with a newly purchased component may be sold or otherwise disposed of, provided the newly purchased
component is so identified as a replacement component for one to be divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The defendants shall provide capital and provide and maintain sufficient working capital to maintain DBS, including
Baroid's diamond bit business; Baroid Drilling; and M&hyph;I Drilling Fluids Co. as viable, ongoing businesses

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The defendants shall preserve the assets required to be divested pursuant to section IV, V, VI, and VII, except those
replaced with newly acquired assets in the ordinary course of business, in a state or repair equal to their state of
repair as of the date of this Final Judgment, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Defendants shall preserve the documents,
books and records of DBS and Baroid's diamond bit business until the date of divestiture of Baroid's diamond bit business,
and shall preserve the documents, books and records of Baroid Drilling and M&hyph;I Drilling Fluids Co. until the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Except in the ordinary course of business, or as is otherwise consistent with the requirements of section XII, the
defendants shall refrain from terminating or altering one or more current employment, salary, or benefit agreements
for one or more executive, managerial, sales, marketing, engineering, or other technical personnel of DBS, Baroid
Drilling or 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
M&hyph;I Drilling Fluids Co., and shall refrain from transferring any employee so employed without the prior approval
of plaintiff.

A. Defendants are hereby enjoined and restrained until one year following the date of divestiture from employment
of, or making offers of employment to, any person, who currently is an executive, managerial, sales, marketing, engineering,
research and development, or other technical employee of Baroid in the United States, the preponderance of whose
duties relate to Baroid's diamond bit business (``Baroid diamond bit employees''.) This provision, however, does
not apply to any employee who is terminated or not hired by the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business. Defendants
shall encourage and facilitate employment of such employees by the purchaser, and shall remove any impediments that
exist which may deter such employees from accepting employment with the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business,
including, but not limited to, the payment of all bonuses to which such employees would otherwise have been entitled
had they remained in the employment of Baroid until the end of fiscal year 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business shall also have the right to hire any person who is currently a sales,
marketing or research and development employee of Baroid, the preponderance of whose duties do not relate to Baroid's
diamond bit business. Such offers of employment and acceptances thereof, contingent upon the consummation of the
purchase of Baroid's diamond bit business, may be made prior to the consummation of the divestiture. Defendants shall
provide any prospective purchaser with cooperation and assistance in its efforts to determine which, if any, such
Baroid employees it seeks to hire. Such cooperation and assistance shall include making available for consultation
purposes to any prospective purchasers of Baroid's diamond bit business all Baroid diamond bit employees, and providing
information sufficient to enable a prospective purchaser to assess the relative performance of all Baroid sales,
marketing and research and development employees. The defendants may, prior to the time the appointment of the trustee
becomes effective pursuant to section VII, take any lawful steps they deem appropriate to retain the services of any
Baroid employees the preponderance of whose duties do not relate to Baroid's diamond bit business.

Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 23, 1993, the United States filed a Complaint alleging that the proposed merger of Dresser Industries,
Inc. (``Dresser'') and Baroid Corporation (``Baroid'') would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18).
The Complaint alleges that the effect of the merger may be substantially to lessen competition in the manufacture
and sale in the United States of drilling fluids, which Dresser, through its 64 percent partnership interest in M&hyph;I
Drilling Fluids, Co. (``M&hyph;I''), and Baroid, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Baroid Drilling Fluids,
Inc. (``Baroid Drilling''), produce and sell. The Complaint also alleges that the effect of the merger may be substantially
to lessen competition in the manufacture and sale in the United States of diamond drill bits, which both Dresser's
Security Division (``Security'') and Baroid's wholly owned subsidiary DB Stratabit (USA) Inc. (``DBS'') manufacture
and sell. Both drilling fluids and diamond drill bits are used by energy exploration and development companies to
drill oil and gas wells. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, a permanent injunction preventing defendants from,
in any manner, combining their drilling fluid and diamond drill bit businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 23, 1993, the United States and defendants filed a stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a
proposed Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the merger. Under the proposed Final
Judgment, as explained more fully below, defendants would be required to sell, by June 1, 1994, either Baroid Drilling
or Dresser's interest in M&hyph;I. By July 1, 1994, defendants would also have to divest Baroid's domestic diamond
drill bit business, including a manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas, as well as licenses for DBS patents and technology
to make and sell DBS diamond drill bits domestically and to a significant extent throughout the world. If defendants
should fail to complete either or both of the divestitures, a trustee appointed by the Court would be empowered to complete
them.

Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 7, 1993, Dresser and Baroid entered into a purchase agreement under which the two companies would merge
and Baroid would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dresser. This acquisition would, if unchallenged, effectively
merge all of the businesses of Dresser and Baroid, including their drilling fluid and diamond drill bit businesses.
The purchase price is approximately $900 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dresser and Baroid are both large, diversified oil field service companies that provide a wide variety of products
and services necessary to explore for and develop oil and gas reserves. Dresser reported total 1992 sales of about
$3.8 billion; Baroid's total 1992 sales were approximately $614.4 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that there are two markets in which Dresser and Baroid are significant competitors. Those two
markets are the manufacture and sale in the United States of drilling fluids and the manufacture and sale in the United
States of diamond drill bits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both products are used by drilling operators to drill for oil and gas. Wells are drilled using a drill pipe (or ``drill
string''), which is a heavy-walled pipe assembled end-to-end from thirty- to forty-foot sections. The drill string
is suspended from the mast of a drilling rig and lowered gradually as the earth is penetrated. As the drill string is
rotated, the earth is cut by a drill bit,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which is attached to the end of the drill string or to a motor that is attached to the end of the drill string. Drilling
fluid is pumped under pressure through the drill string to the drill bit at the end of the string. Drilling fluid, a mixture
of natural and synthetic chemical compounds (principally barite and bentonite), improves the performance and durability
of the drill string and the tools in the hole by, for example, cooling and lubricating the drill bit and controlling
downhole pressure.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two types of drill bits: tricone drill bits and diamond drill bits. Tricone bits consist of three steel cones
that rotate as the bit turns. Diamond drill bits have no moving parts but contain cutting elements made of natural or
synthetic diamond embedded in the bottom and sides of a steel or matrix body. The kind of drill bits used in a particular
drilling operation depends upon the depth of the well, the direction of the drilling, the type of formation through
which the drill bit must cut, and the type of drilling fluid used. Diamond drill bits provide higher penetration rates,
better durability, and require the drill string to be pulled out of the well hole fewer times than tricone bits. Diamond
bits typically cost between three and eight times as much as tricone bits. Where daily drilling costs are high and the
geological conditions are suitable, customers prefer to use diamond bits over tricone bits in order to reduce drilling
time and, thereby, lower overall costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both drilling fluids and diamond drill bits are critical products for oil and gas exploration and development. The
use of an incorrectly formulated drilling fluid can result in a costly, dangerous hole blow-out or the immobilization
of the drill string. The percentage of total drilling costs accounted for by drilling fluids can be as high as 10 percent.
The percentage of total drilling costs accounted for by drill bits is less, usually no more than 5 percent, but the cost
of a bit failure can be very high. Valuable drilling time is lost because the entire drill string must be pulled out of
the hole, disassembled, a new bit attached, and the drill string reassembled and run back into the hole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M&hyph;I is a vertically integrated company with mining operations, manufacturing plants, research and engineering
facilities, distribution facilities and sales and service centers located throughout the world. M&hyph;I's worldwide,
net sales of drilling fluids for fiscal year 1992 and $383.6 million. Its domestic sales were approximately $110 million.
Baroid Drilling produces and sells drilling fluids through a distribution network consisting of approximately
150 onshore and offshore stockpoints and over 50 field laboratories. In 1992, Baroid Drilling's worldwide, net sales
were $331.5 million, and its domestic sales were approximately $100 million.

Dresser's Security Division has a diamond drill bit manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. Dresser's total 1992
worldwide sales of diamond drill bits were about $10.4 million and its U.S. sales of that product were about $4.7 million.
Baroid produces diamond drill bits at manufacturing facilities located in Houston, Texas, Brussels, Belgium, and
Leduc, Alberta, Canada. Baroid's 1992 worldwide sales of diamond drill bits were approximately $40 million, and
its domestic sales were about $3.6 million. Baroid's domestic diamond drill bit operations are handled through its
DBS subsidiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids is a relevant product market for antitrust
purposes. A small, significant nontransitory price increase would not cause customers to use another product instead
of drilling fluid. The United States is a relevant geographic market for the drilling fluid market within the meaning
of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Complaint states that this market is highly concentrated and would become substantially
more concentrated as a result of the merger of Baroid and Dresser. Three companies dominate the drilling fluid business
in the United States, including M&hyph;I and Baroid Drilling. Based on 1992 sales data, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
M&hyph;I was the largest firm in the drilling fluid market, accounting for about 29 percent of sales, while Baroid
Drilling, the second largest firm, accounted for about 22 percent. The merger of Dresser and Baroid would increase
the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index by about 1200 points to a post-acquisition level of more than 2800 points. The merger
of Dresser and Baroid will diminish competition in the drilling fluid market by enabling the remaining competitors
more likely, more successfully, and more completely to engage in coordinated interaction that harms customers.
The increase in concentration will result in higher prices for drilling fluids, which will increase the costs of oil
and gas exploration and development in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successful new entry into the United States drilling fluid market is difficult and time-consuming. Moreover, the
expansion of fringe firms would be insufficient to counteract or deter a small but significant nontransitory price
increase. To gain a significant market share, a firm must have an adequate, reliable, and independent source of barite
and bentonite and a significant research and development capability. Because the costs to the customer of product
failure are so high, the firm must also have a reputation for providing a reliable product and dependable service.
The establishment of such a reputation takes years and requires a significant investment of resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint also alleges that the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits is a relevant product market for antitrust
purposes. A small, significant nontransitory increase in the price of diamond drill bits would not cause customers
to use another product. The United States is a relevant geographic market for this product market within the meaning
of section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Complaint states that this market is concentrated, with five companies, including
Dresser and Baroid, accounting for approximately 90 percent of all diamond drill bit sales in the United States. These
five companies have established reputations for providing dependable diamond drill bits for almost all types of
drilling operations, backed by extensive product research, development, and testing. For a significant number
of drilling projects, only these five companies have the product quality, performance record, and engineering support
required to be considered by customers as a supplier of diamond drill bits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States diamond drill bit market would become significantly more concentrated as a result of the merger
of Dresser and Baroid. Based on 1992 sales data, Dresser was the third largest firm in the diamond drill bit market,
accounting for about 13 percent of sales, while Baroid, the fifth largest firm, accounted for about 10 percent. The
merger of Dresser and Baroid would result in a competitor having almost 25 percent of U.S. diamond drill bit sales,
and would increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman index by more than 250 points to a post-acquisition level of more than
2300. As a result of the acquisition, four firms would account for approximately 90 percent of sales. The merger of
Dresser and Baroid will diminish competition in the United States diamond drill bit market by enabling the remaining
competitors more likely, more successfully, and more completely to engage in coordinated interaction that harms
customers. This increase in concentration would result in higher prices for diamond drill bits, which will increase
the cost of oil and gas exploration and development in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entry into the United States market for diamond drill bits is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. To enter
the diamond drill bit market and gain a significant market share, a firm must build a manufacturing and research and
development facility, develop diamond bits, and establish a reputation for the efficiency, durability, and reliability
of its product under actual drilling conditions in a wide variety of different geographic and geological conditions.
Because the performance of a bit is critical to assuring the lowest possible drilling costs, and the risk of financial
loss due to bit failure is substantial, customers are generally very reluctant to purchase bits from a new supplier
that lacks a proven performance record. It would take several years and significant investment for a new supplier
to establish a performance record and obtain the sales that are necessary to support the substantial engineering,
technical services, and research and development capabilities possessed by the five major competitors in this market.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States brought this action because the effect of the proposed merger of Dresser and Baroid may be substantially
to lessen competition, in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, in the United States for the manufacture and sale
of drilling fluids and the manufacture and sale of diamond bits. The risk to competition posed by this transaction,
however, would be substantially eliminated were defendants to divest either Baroid Drilling or Dresser's interest
in M&hyph;I, and Baroid's diamond bit business, as defined in the proposed Final Judgment, to a purchaser or purchasers
that would operate the businesses as active, independent, and financially viable United States competitors in the
respective product markets. To this end, the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment are designed to accomplish
the sale of a drilling fluid business as well as the sale of Baroid's diamond bit business and to prevent the anticompetitive
effects of the proposed acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest the ``drilling fluid business'' by June 1,
1994, to a purchaser that has the intent and capability to compete promptly and effectively in the manufacture and
sale of drilling fluids in the United States. The ``drilling fluid business'' is defined in the proposed Final Judgment
as either Dresser's 64 percent interest in M&hyph;I, or all assets of Baroid Drilling and any other assets that Baroid
owns or has an interest in that are used to research, develop, test, produce, manufacture, service or market, domestically
or internationally, drilling fluids. If the divestiture has not occurred by June 1, 1994, the United States may, in
its sole discretion, extent the time period up to one month. The proposed Final Judgment prohibits the sale by the defendants
of the drilling fluid business to their major competitors in the drilling fluid market: Baker Hughes, Inc., Schlumberger
Ltd., and Anchor Drilling Fluids. This prohibition lasts for the life of the decree. The purchaser of the drilling
fluid business is also prohibited from combining that business with the drilling operations of any of those three
companies or Dresser. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest ``Baroid's diamond bit business'' by July
1, 1994, to a purchaser that has the intent and capability to compete promptly and effectively in the manufacture and
sale of diamond bits in the United States. ``Baroid's diamond bit business'' is defined in the proposed Final Judgment
as the assets owned or controlled by Baroid that are or have been used in the United States to research, develop, test,
manufacture, service or market its diamond drill bits. The assets to be divested include Baroid's diamond bit manufacturing
facility in Houston, Texas, all equipment in that plant, and all equipment owned or controlled by Baroid that was used
to manufacture matrix diamond bits.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Baroid's diamond bit business also includes a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell matrix diamond bits in
the United States and a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell steel-bodied diamond bits anywhere in the world,
except The People's Republic of China, using all patents and other intellectual property owned or controlled by Baroid.
These licenses will allow the purchaser to be an effective competitor in the United States diamond drill bit market.
The business divested will additionally include research and development equipment in the Houston plant and access
for two years to certain pieces of research and development equipment in Baroid's Belgium facility, as well as data
from almost all research and development projects relating to matrix or steel-bodied drill bits undertaken by Baroid
up to and including the date of the divestiture. Research and development of diamond drill bits includes, but is not
limited to, engineering support relating to the analysis and testing of a diamond drill bit's design, application,
and components in order to enhance the bit's performance or to create a new diamond bit. In addition, Baroid's diamond
bit business includes all data recording diamond bit performance in Baroid's possession at the date of divestiture.
The purchaser also has the right for two years to market its diamond bits as being manufactured pursuant to a license
from DBS but will not have the right to use the trade names of ``Stratabit,'' ``DB Stratabit, Inc.,'' ``Diamont Boart,''
``DBS,'' or any derivative thereof. The licenses granted need not be transferable, and thus remain with the original
purchaser in perpetuity unless transferred in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of Baroid's diamond
bit business.

There are two basic designs of diamond drill bits: Matrix diamond bits and steel-bodied diamond bits. Baroid currently
manufactures only steel-bodied diamond bits, at the Houston facility. In the past it also manufactured matrix diamond
bits at the plant. Some equipment that was used for manufacturing matrix diamond bits is in storage.

The divestiture requirement will be satisfied if the defendants have entered a binding contract to sell Baroid's
diamond bit business by July 1, 1994, as long as the divestiture will be completed by September 1, 1994. Also, if the
defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture by July 1, but demonstrate to the United States' satisfaction
that they are then engaged in negotiations with a prospective purchaser that are likely to result in the required divestiture,
the United States may extend the time period for divestiture up to three more months. The defendants are prohibited
by the proposed Final Judgment from selling Baroid's diamond bit business to their major competitors in the diamond
drill bit market: Baker Hughes, Inc., Smith International, Inc., and Camco International, Inc. That prohibition
lasts for the life of the decree. The purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business is also prohibited from combining
that business with the diamond drill bit operations of any of those companies or Dresser for the life of the decree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed Final Judgment, defendants must take all reasonable steps necessary to accomplish both divestitures
quickly, and shall cooperate with bona fide prospective purchasers by supplying all information relevant to the
proposed sale. Should defendants fail to complete the divestitures by the specified deadlines to purchasers approved
by the United States, the proposed Final Judgment provides for the appointment by the Court of a trustee or trustees
to accomplish either or both of the divestitures. Section VI relates to the selection and appointment of a trustee
to sell the drilling fluid business, and section VII relates to the selection and appointment of a trustee to sell Baroid's
diamond bit business. Following the trustee's appointment, only to trustee will have the right to sell the assets
to be divested, and defendants will be required to pay for all of the trustee's sale-related expenses. Should the trustee
not accomplish the divestiture it is empowered to make within six months of appointment, the trustee and the parties
will make recommendations to the Court, which shall enter such orders as it deems appropriate to carry out the purpose
of the trust, which may include extending the trust or the term of the trustee's appointment. If a trustee is appointed
to sell Baroid's diamond bit business, that business will include a license to manufacture and sell Baroid's steel-bodied
diamond bits anywhere in the world, including The People's Republic of China.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VIII of the proposed Final Judgment requires that the defendants or the trustee, whoever is responsible for
accomplishing the divestiture at the time, notify the United States when a binding contract has been entered so that
the United States has an opportunity to evaluate the purchaser. This section gives the United States the right to obtain
information about the perspective purchaser. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the
proposed purchaser of the drilling fluid business, a divestiture of that business under section IV cannot be consummated.
Upon the United States' objection to the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business under section V, the transaction
cannot be consummated. Should the United States object to a sale of either business by the trustee, the divestiture
cannot be consummated unless approved by the Court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IX of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to submit monthly reports to the United States regarding
its efforts to divest the drilling fluid business and Baroid's diamond bit business, including the status of discussions
or negotiations with any person. Section X states that defendants may finance part of all of either divestiture with
the prior consent of the United States. Under section XI of the proposed Final Judgment, defendants must take certain
steps to ensure that, until the required divestiture has been completed, Baroid Drilling and DBS will be held separate
and apart from Dresser and that both businesses, as well as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
M&hyph;I, will be maintained as viable competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Final Judgment also contains provisions designed to ensure that the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit
business will have the opportunity to hire a work force sufficient to maintain that business as an effective competitor
in the United States. Under section XII of the proposed Final Judgment, defendants are required to encourage and facilitate
employment by the purchaser of all Baroid employees in the United States, the preponderance of whose duties relate
to Baroid's diamond bit business, and will be prohibited from employing these individuals for one year after the divestiture
unless those individuals are terminated or not hired by the purchaser. In addition, defendants are required to assist
the purchaser so that the purchaser may determine if it would like to hire other Baroid sales, marketing and research
and development employees, the preponderance or whose duties do not relate to Baroid's diamond drill bit business.
This assistance consists of providing information and consultation regarding the employees' relative job duties
and performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section XV provides that the proposed Final Judgment will expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry by
the Court.

Section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15) provides that any person who has just been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered, as
well as costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist
the bringing of any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of section 5(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.

Procedure Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States and defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after
compliance with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent. The APPA
conditions entry upon the Court's determination that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which
any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who
wishes to comment should do so within 60 days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the

Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Final Judgment requires that either Dresser's interest in M&hyph;I or Baroid Drilling, and Baroid's
diamond bit business be sold to a purchaser or purchasers that would use the respective businesses promptly to become
viable competitors in both of the product markets alleged in the Complaint. Thus, compliance with the proposed Final
Judgment and the completion of the divestitures required by the Judgment would resolve the competitive concerns
raised by the proposed transaction, and assure that the respective businesses would remain independent and active
competitors to Dresser's drilling fluid and diamond bit businesses in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Litigation is, of course, always an alternative to a consent decree in a section 7 case. The United States rejected
this alternative because the divestitures required under the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the merger
of Dresser and Baroid from having a significant anticompetitive effect in either of the two relevant product markets
alleged, and will provide substantially all of the relief requested in the Complaint. The United States believes
that in the hands of appropriate purchasers, the drilling fluid business that is divested and Baroid's diamond bit
business will likely maintain their respective competitive roles in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States is satisfied that the proposed Final Judgment fully resolves the anticompetitive effects of the
proposed merger alleged in the Complaint. Although the proposed Final Judgment may not be entered until the criteria
established by the APPA (115 U.S.C. 15 (b)&hyph;(h)) have been satisfied, the public will benefit immediately from
the safeguards in the proposed Final Judgment because the defendants have stipulated to comply with the terms of the
Judgment pending its entry by the Court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their participants and beneficiaries; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

General Information

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act&blank;&blank;
and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact
that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction
is in fact a prohibited transaction; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

Proposed Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the sale for cash of certain limited partnership units (the Units) from the Plan to
Cascade West Sportswear, Inc. (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the following
conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The fair market value of the Units is established by an appraiser independent of the Plan and the Employer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Employer pays the greater of $131,560 or the current fair market value of the Units plus an ``opportunity loss''
of no less than $171,000; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The sale is a one-time transaction for cash; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan pays no commissions or other expenses in relation to the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Facts and Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Employer is engaged in the business of outerwear garment manufacturing. Eric Hilf, a 50-percent shareholder
of the Employer, is the trustee of the Plan. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which had approximately 119 participants
and total assets of $221,364 as of December 31, 1992. The board of directors of the Employer voted in 1992 to terminate
the Plan. The last contribution to the Plan was made for the Plan year ended December 31, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In July 1980 the Plan acquired the Units which represented a 28.6 percent interest in the Good Sam Investors limited
partnership (the Partnership). Following its formation, the Partnership acquired an undeveloped parcel of real
estate (the Property) near downtown Puyallup, Washington. The Plan initially paid $51,667 for the Units. Since the
purchase of the Units, the Plan has contributed additional amounts to the Partnership for its share of the carrying
costs of the Property. The Plan also borrowed money from an unrelated commercial bank to pay off the Plan's share of
the original seller-financed acquisition of the Property by the Partnership. The Partnership has made a distribution
to the Plan totaling $49,028. Net of such distributions, the total amount expended by the Plan in regard to acquiring
and holding the Units (including the above $51,667) was $239,730 as of December 31, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Plan acquired the Units because they originally appeared to represent a good investment. The applicant represents
that neither the Employer nor any of its officers has invested separately in the Partnership. The other investors
in the Units are unrelated parties. The Property is not adjacent to any property owned by the Employer and has not been
used by the Employer or any other party in interest with respect to the Plan since the time of the purchase of the Units.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several business and residential developments in the area near the Property were underway at the time the Partnership
was formed. The Partnership consulted with real estate and engineering firms during the early 1980s to determine
the requirements to make the Property salable at an attractive price. However, the City of Puyallup later withdrew
a determination statement which would have permitted development of the Property. In 1986 the Partnership sold a
portion of the Property to an unrelated party for $180,000, resulting in the above mentioned distribution of $49,028
to the Plan. Since then the Partnership has listed the Property on three occasions with three different real estate
brokers but has been unable to sell the Property. A significant portion of the Property has now been classified as wetlands
and cannot be developed without substantial additional expense. Plan fiduciaries have concluded that the Property
could not be sold to an unrelated party without a substantial price concession or considerable additional expense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department expresses no opinion as to whether plan fiduciaries violated any of the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of part 4 of title I of the Act in acquiring and holding the Units. Section 404(a)(1) of the Act requires,
among other things, that a plan fiduciary must act prudently and that plan investments must be properly diversified.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The Plan obtained an appraisal on the Property dated March 12, 1993, from Roger D. Ockfen, MAI (Ockfen), a real estate
appraiser located in Tacoma, Washington. The applicant represents that Ockfen is independent of the Plan and the
Employer. Placing emphasis on the comparable sales approach to value, Ockfen estimated the fair market value of the
usable land area of the Property as of February 18, 1993, to be approximately $460,000. Based on this amount, the value
of the Units representing the Plan's 28.6 percent interest in the Partnership totaled $131,560. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The applicant represents that there is no market for the Units and that they are not expected to appreciate in value.
However, the Plan cannot make liquidating distributions to its participants without first selling the Units. Accordingly,
the Plan proposes to sell the Units to the Employer. The Employer will pay the Plan the greater of $131,560 or the fair
market value of the Units as of the date of sale, based on an updated independent appraisal of the Property, in addition
to an ``opportunity loss'' of approximately $171,000. The ``opportunity loss'' amount, to be adjusted at the time
of sale, was calculated assuming a six percent annual rate of return on the Plan's investment in the Partnership since
the initial time of that investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total payments to the Plan will thus exceed the Plan's original acquisition and subsequent net carrying costs
of the Units (which totaled $239,730 at the end of 1992). The sale of the Units will be a one-time transaction for cash
and the Plan will pay no commissions or fees in regard to the transaction. The applicant represents that any amounts
received by the Plan as a result of the proposed transaction which are in excess of the fair market value of the Units
will be treated as a contribution to the Plan. However, such contribution will not exceed the limitations of section
415 of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) The fair market value of the Units will be established by an appraiser independent of
the Employer; (2) the Employer will pay the greater of $131,560 or the fair market value of the Units on the date of sale
plus an ``opportunity loss'' of approximately $171,000; (3) the sale will be a one-time transaction for cash; and
(4) the transaction will remove from the Plan an investment which is not liquid and which is not expected to appreciate
in value.

The Department of the Treasury has determined that, if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and
its sponsoring employer (or affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less or receiving more than fair
market value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring employer to the plan and thus must
be examined under the applicable provisions of the Code, including sections 401(a)(4), 404 and 415.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

will not exceed twenty-five percent of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the New Loan; (c) the
New Loan is secured by a first lien interest on certain equipment (the Equipment), which has been appraised by a qualified,

1. The Plan is a defined contribution plan sponsored by the Employer, who is engaged in the business of precision and
general metal fabrication. As of December 31, 1992, the Plan had total assets of $1,942,187 and eighteen participants.
The trustee of the Plan is Robert Linton, the sole shareholder of the Employer. Mr. Linton has the sole investment discretion
with respect to the Plan assets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On January 26, 1988, the Department granted Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 88&hyph;12 at 53 FR 2103. PTE
88&hyph;12 permitted the Plan to lend $240,000 to the Employer (the Original Loan). The Original Loan, made on March
1, 1988, has a ten year term and carries interest at the rate of one and one-half percentage points over the prime rate
of Rainier National Bank of Seattle, Washington. It has been amortized in equal monthly installments of principal
and interest. The Original Loan is secured by certain other equipment (the Other Equipment) of the Employer. The Original
Loan is being monitored by Sidney J. Starr, CPA (Mr. Starr) of Kirkland, Washington, who is serving on behalf of the
Plan as the independent, qualified fiduciary. As of October 1, 1993, the remaining principal balance due under the
Original Loan was $136,062. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Employer requests an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Plan to lend $485,000 to the
Employer under the terms and conditions described herein. The Employer represents that a portion of the New Loan proceeds
will be used to repay the outstanding balance on the Original Loan. The remaining balance of the New Loan proceeds will
be used to finance a portion of the $582,400 purchase price of a new 60

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; Shear Genius Punching/Shearing Cell (the Cell) manufactured by E.W. Bliss Company. The Cell will be utilized
by the Employer in its manufacturing operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The New Loan will be in the principal amount of $485,000. The applicant states that at no time will the amount of the
New Loan represent more than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. The New Loan will be secured by a first
lien interest on the Equipment, which consists of two pieces of unencumbered machinery owned by the Employer. UCC&hyph;1
Filing Statements and a Security Agreement will be filed with the Secretary of State of Washington to reflect the Plan's
security interest in the Equipment. In addition, the Employer will insure the Equipment against casualty loss and
will designate the Plan as the loss payee of such insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The New Loan will have a ten year term and will be evidenced by a promissory note (the Note). The Note will require the
Employer to make equal monthly installments of principal and interest amortized over the ten year period. Interest
will accrue on the New Loan at the rate of one and one-half percentage points above the prime rate of CityBank (CityBank)
of Lynnwood, Washington, an unrelated entity. The interest rate will be adjusted quarterly by the Plan's independent
fiduciary in accordance with the prime rate offered by CityBank. The Plan will not incur any fees, commission, or other
expenses in connection with the New Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated July 12, 1993, the Employer received a loan commitment in the amount of $485,000 from CityBank. The
terms offered by CityBank are the same as the terms of the Loan, including the quarterly adjustment of the interest
rate to one and one-half percentage points above the prime rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Equipment consists of a Finn-Power FMC Line and a Bliss 500 ton press. Based upon appraisals performed by Jim
Birdsall and Theodore Egleston (the Appraisals), the total fair market value of the Equipment is $1,228,000, which
is in excess of 200 percent of the amount of the New Loan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jim Birdsall, the president of Nor Star Machine Tools, Inc. located in Bellevue, Washington, appraised the Finn-Power
FMC Line. Mr. Birdsall represents that he has experience with Finn-Power presses and the present market for this type
of equipment. Mr. Birdsall represents that both he and Nor Star Machine Tools, Inc. are unrelated to and independent
of the Employer. In an appraisal report dated June 4, 1993, Mr. Birdsall placed the fair market value of the Finn-Power
FMC Line at $792,000, approximately eighty percent of its acquisition price of $990,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a subsequent letter dated December 3, 1993, Mr. Birdsall describes certain factors he considered in determining
the fair market value. Mr. Birdsall states that the twenty percent discount of the acquisition price is attributable
to two years of equal amounts of depreciation on the Finn-Power FMC Line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Theodore Egleston, a national sales manager for E.W. Bliss Company located in Hastings, Michigan, appraised the
Bliss 500 ton press. Mr. Egelston states that he has twenty-five years of experience in appraising used Bliss equipment
for insurance companies and lending institutions. Mr. Egelston represents that he is unrelated to and independent
of the Employer. In appraisal reports dated July 12, 1993 and December 3, 1993, Mr. Egleston placed the fair market
value of the Bliss 500 ton press at $436,000, or eighty-four percent of its $520,000 acquisition price. Mr. Egelston's
valuation takes into consideration six years of equal amounts of depreciation on the Bliss 500 ton press's acquisition
price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Mr. Starr will serve as the qualified, independent fiduciary for the Plan with respect to the New Loan. Mr. Starr
represents that he has extensive experience in business and loan transactions. Mr. Starr represents that he is unrelated
to and independent of the Employer and its affiliates, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Linton. Mr. Starr states that he understands and acknowledges his duties, responsibilities, and liabilities
in acting as a fiduciary with respect to the Plan, based upon consultation with counsel experienced with the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Starr represents that all payments under the Original Loan have been paid in a timely manner and that there have
been no delinquencies. Mr. Starr also states that the collateral to loan ratio under the Original Loan has always been
maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Starr has reviewed the terms of the New Loan and all of the documents and relevant information in connection with
the New Loan, including the Appraisals. Mr. Starr states that the terms of the New Loan compare favorably with the terms
of similar transaction between unrelated parties and would be an arm's-length transaction as evidenced by the terms
offered by CityBank (see Item 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 above). In addition, Mr. Starr adds that the Loan will be secured by a first lien interest on the Equipment, which has
been valued in excess of 200 percent of the New Loan amount. Mr. Starr acknowledges his responsibility to quarterly
review the Loan and make the necessary adjustments to the interest rate based upon the prime rate of CityBank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Starr has reviewed the current investment portfolio of the Plan and considered the diversification of the Plans
assets as well as the liquidity needs of the Plan. Based on this analysis, Mr. Starr believes that the proposed transaction
would be in the best interest of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries as an investment for the Plan's portfolio.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Starr states that the New Loan would be an appropriate and desirable investment for the plan, based on the New Loan's
rate of return, the collateral securing the New Loan, the character and diversification of the Plan's other assets,
and the projected liquidity needs of the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Starr has reviewed the financial condition of the Employer in order to establish its ability to repay the New Loan.
In this regard, Mr. Starr states that he has examined the most recent financial statements from the Employee and its
credit history. Mr. Starr concludes that the Employer is credit-worthy and, based upon its current ratio and current
assets to debt ratio, is financially capable of making the monthly payments required by the New Loan without such payments
having an adverse impact on its cash flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Starr represents that he will monitor the New Loan through its entire duration and will take any appropriate action
necessary to protect the interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries, include a foreclosure on the
Equipment in event of default. Mr. Starr will monitor the condition and adequacy of the Equipment as collateral for
the Plan to ensure that the New Loan remains secured by collateral worth at least 200 percent of the New Loan at all times.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Starr will monitor the Plan's assets to ensure that the amount of the Plan's assets will at all times remain less
than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. Mr. Starr will require the Employer to provide additional payments
on the New Loan to the Plan, if necessary, to reduce the principal amount of the New Loan to maintain an appropriate ratio
between the outstanding principal balance of the New Loan and the Plan's total assets. Mr. Starr has acknowledged
his responsibility to monitor compliance of all parties with terms and conditions of the proposed exemption, including
the twenty-five percent limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The terms of the New Loan will be at least as favorable to the Plan as those
obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the New Loan will not exceed twenty-five percent
of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the New Loan; (c) the New Loan will be secured by a first lien
interest on the Equipment, which has been appraised by a qualified, independent appraiser to ensure that the fair
market value of the Property is at least 200 percent of the amount of the New Loan; (d) the fair market value of the Equipment
will remain at least equal to 200 percent of the outstanding balance of the New Loan throughout the duration of the New
Loan; (e) Mr. Starr, as independent, qualified fiduciary for the Plan, will determine that the New Loan is in the best
interests of the Plan and protective of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries; and (f) Mr. Starr will monitor
compliance by the Employer with the terms and conditions of the New Loan and the exemption throughout the duration
of the transaction, taking any action necessary to safeguard the Plan's interest, including foreclosure on the Equipment
in the event of default.

The Employer and sponsor of the Plan is an Iowa corporation, with offices in Harlan, Iowa. The Employer is engaged in
the manufacture of mill supplies and trencher parts. Todd Plumb is the sole shareholder of the common stock of the Employer.
Since 1990, Todd Plumb has served as the sole trustee for the Plan. Prior to that time, the trustees of the Plan were the
Southgate Trust Company, Todd Plumb, and Max Plumb. Further, the GICs were held on behalf of the Plan in the past by Southgate
Trust and are now held by First Trust MidAmerica. Norwest Bank Iowa, N.A., located in Des Moines, Iowa is currently
acting as administrator of the Plan and will assume the duties of trustee of the Plan, as soon as this proposed exemption
is granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. It is represented that since 1983, the Plan held participation interests in a fund which provided debt financing
to a series of separate trusts (the Trusts) which engaged in commercial real estate development. In addition, since
1984, the Plan also held equity participation interests in such Trusts. In October 1985, all of the Trusts were merged
into the Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII in which the Plan retained ownership interests. Subsequently, on December
15, 1988, Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII was converted into a Master Mortgage Investment Fund, Inc., a real estate
investment trust (the REIT). The Plan acquired the Assets through certain transfers of the Plan's holdings in Master
Mortgage Fund Trust VII to the REIT.

 The Department notes that the decisions of the fiduciaries on behalf of the Plan, in connection with the acquisition
and holding of the Assets are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of part 4, subpart B, of title
I. The Department expresses no opinion, herein, as to whether any of the relevant provisions of part 4, subpart B, of
title I have been violated regarding the Plan's investment in and subsequent holding of the Assets, and no exemption
from such provisions is proposed herein. In this regard, the Department is expressing no views with respect to the
establishment, administration, or operation of the REIT, nor has any relief been requested in that regard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption consist of the Plan's holdings of participation interests
in three funds (the Funds). One of the Funds holds the Preferred Stock of the REIT (the Preferred Fund), another holds
Common Stock of the REIT (the Common Fund), and the third fund (the Secured Note I Fund; formerly the Guaranteed Plus
Fund) holds notes of the REIT collateralized by mortgages. The REIT, a Delaware corporation, has offices in Overland
Park, Kansas. The investors in the REIT include the Plan and other qualified retirement plans. The REIT was organized
for the primary purpose of realizing income from investing in and originating short-term loans, junior real estate
mortgage loans, wrap around mortgage loans, first mortgage loans with and without participation features, construction
loans and pre-development loans to real estate developers, secured by income producing real property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REIT completed its initial one-year public offering on November 18, 1989, selling a total of 2,756,474 shares
of preferred stock (the Preferred Stock) and 841,542 shares of common stock (the Common Stock) for subscriptions
in the amount of $35,980,160. As of December 31, 1990, the REIT had 2,491,522 shares of Preferred Stock and 1,308,669
shares of Common Stock outstanding. It is represented that the change in outstanding stock of the REIT reflects shares
issued under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the conversion of Preferred Stock to Common Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. It is represented that between 1984 and 1990, the rate of return received by the Plan on its interest in these Assets
or in the Trusts fluctuated from a high of 15.8% in 1984 to a low of 5.8% in 1990. During the period between 1983 to 1991,
the percentage of the Plan's portfolio involved with these Assets or with the Trusts varied from a low of 8.66% in 1983,
to a high of 63% in October 1991. Through its investment in the Preferred Fund, the Plan owns approximately 43,848 shares
of Preferred Stock of the REIT, as of December 31, 1992. Likewise, through its investment in the Common Fund, the Plan
owns approximately 211 shares of Common Stock of the REIT, as of the same date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Secured Note I Fund was established on January 31, 1988, by Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII for the purpose of providing
secured debt financing to the related Trusts. After the REIT was established in 1989, the Secured Note I Fund offered
a $10,000,000 line of credit to the REIT. Under this line of credit, as of December 31, 1990, the Secured Note I Fund had
extended $8,344,522 to the REIT, payable on January 31, 1991. Due to the inability of the REIT to repay this debt on January
31, 1991, the Secured Note I Fund again extended credit to the REIT, in the form of two notes (the Notes) in the amounts,
respectively, of $1,677,044 and $6,805,340 and extended the date of repayment under the terms of these Notes to January
310, 1992, which in turn was extended to January 31, 1993. It is represented that as of September 7, 1993, the Notes had
not been repaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notes bear interest at nine percent (9%) per annum adjusted from time to time in accordance with certain interest
rates charged by the Merchants Bank of Kansas City and are collateralized by the assets of the REIT, primarily mortgages
which are subordinated to unrelated third party notes. The total outstanding balance of these Notes, as of September
30, 1991, was $8,862,016. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan acquired a participation interest in the Secured Note I Fund as a result of a transfer of funds from the Master
Mortgage Fund VII at the end of 1989, and another such transfer from the Preferred Fund at the beginning of 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On April 17, 1992, the Board of Directors of the REIT unanimously approved the filing by the REIT for financial reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Since that time the REIT has been operating as debtor-in-possession
under the protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. On its balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 1992, the
REIT lists total assets of $23,321,456 and total liabilities of $18,814,132. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Employer has proposed to purchase the Plan's interests in the Preferred Fund, the Common Fund, and the Secured
Note I Fund. It is represented that there is no market for the Assets and that the income potential and the market value
of such Assets has declined. Further, Todd Plumb, as trustee for the Plan, has been repeatedly unsuccessful in attempting
to sell such Assets to a third party purchaser or in having the Assets redeemed by the REIT. For this reason, the applicant
believes it will be in the best interest of the Plan to invest the proceeds of the Asset sales to the Employer in other
securities, the return rate of which will significantly exceed the rate of earnings on the Assets. It is represented
that, if such Assets were retained in the Plan, there may not be sufficient liquidity in the Plan to pay cash to beneficiaries
or to participants withdrawing from the Plan. In this regard, the sales of the Assets to the Employer will avoid an in-kind
distribution of an undivided interest in the Assets to the participants and beneficiaries which would have no immediate
value and little long term value. The Assets are valued at a book value to the Plan of $683,384, as of June 30, 1993. In
accordance with this value, as of September 30, 1993, the Assets represented approximately 44% of the assets of the
Plan. The applicant represents that the book value is approximately the amount invested by the Plan in the Assets.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Employer proposes, over a period of two (2) years, to purchase annually a portion of such Assets at a price each year
of $341,692. This amount is one half of the book value of the Assets, as of June 30, 1993. It has been represented that
immediately following the execution of the first sale of the Assets to the Employer, the book value of the Assets remaining
in the Plan will constitute no more than 22.06% of the assets held at that time by the Plan, without taking into consideration
in determining the value of the Plan's assets either projected contributions by the Employer or by its employees or
anticipated income to the Plan from other assets. The Employer has agreed to pay the costs of the exemption application,
including providing notice to all interested persons. Further, it is represented that the Plan will incur no fees,
commissions, or expenses as a result of the sales of the Assets to the Employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In an appraisal, dated September 7, 1993, Cyril Ann Mandelbaum, CPA (Ms. Mandelbaum) estimated the fair market
value of the Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption. Ms. Mandelbaum represents that she is qualified
to appraise the Assets in that she is a certified public accountant and a member of the American Society of Appraisers.
Further, Ms. Mandelbaum represents her independence in that she does not have any present or contemplated future
interest in the Assets or any other interest which might tend to prevent her from making a fair and unbiased appraisal
of such Assets. According to Ms. Mandelbaum, the estimated value of the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock is $1.19
and $1.18 per share, respectively. Taking into consideration a 28% discount for the minority interest held by the
Plan in the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock and a discount of 35% for the lack of marketability of such stock, Ms.
Mandelbaum reached a value for the Plan's interest in both the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock at between zero
and $.53 per share. With respect to the value of the Secured Note I Fund, Ms. Mandelbaum indicates that there is little
likelihood of Notes issued by the Secured Note I Fund ever being paid. Accordingly, in the opinion of Ms. Mandelbaum
the Plan's interest in the Secured Note I Fund is assumed to be worthless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In summary, the applicant, represents that the proposed transactions meet the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Plan will be able to invest the proceeds from such sales in more profitable assets; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Plan will receive no less than fair market value of such Assets on the date of each sale and in the aggregate the
Plan will receive no less than $683,384 for the sale of all of the Assets to the Employer;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Treasury has determined that if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and
its sponsoring employer (or affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less than or receiving more than
fair market value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring employer to the plan and therefore
must be examined under applicable provisions of the Code, including section 401(a)(4), 404, and 415.

The applicant represents that to the extent the Plan will receive greater than the fair market value for the Assets,
the limitations, as set forth in section 415 of the Code, if applicable, will not be exceeded. It is further represented
that the allocation of any gain on the sale of the shares will not violate the discrimination provisions of sections
404 and 401(a)(4) of the Code. Inasmuch as interpretations of sections 401, 404 and 415 of the Code are within the jurisdiction
of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department expresses no opinion with respect to the applicant's representations
of compliance. However, the Department does note that the applicant also represents that the sale of the Assets is
being completed solely to prevent an investment loss which might result to the Plan by virtue of the Plan's holding
of the Assets and to avoid, without admitting, any possible fiduciary liability with respect to the holding of the
Assets by the Plan.

Summary of Facts and Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan with 35 participants and total assets of approximately $6,492,809 as of December
1, 1993. The Plan is maintained by the Employer, which is a South Dakota general partnership engaged in the practice
of law in Rapid City, South Dakota. Investment discretion over the assets of the Plan is exercised by the Plan's three
named fiduciaries: Thomas H. Foye, Charles L. Riter, and Patrick K. Duffy, each of whom is a partner in the Employer.
The Plan's assets are held in trust by the Norwest Bank South Dakota, N.A. (the Trustee), which was formerly named Norwest
Capital Management and Trust Company. The Trustee represents that aside from its function as Trustee, it is independent
of the Employer, although the Employer has deposits in, and a current installment loan with, the Trustee's commercial
department totalling substantially less than one percent of the total deposits and total loans of its commercial
department. Additionally, the Trustee states that the Employer performs professional services for the Trustee,
and that total fees paid by the Trustee to the Employer for such services constitute less than one percent of the Employer's
gross income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Among the assets of the Plan is the Property, a parcel of improved real property which constitutes the Employer's
principal place of business. The Property is located in downtown Rapid City, South Dakota and is improved with a two-story
brick office building (the Building) containing approximately 9,600 square feet of office space. The Employer has
leased the Property from the Plan under a triple net lease (the Prior Lease) with a term of ten years commencing January
1, 1984 and ending December 31, 1993. The Employer's lease of the Property from the Plan under the Prior Lease was exempt
from the prohibitions of section 406 of the Act and section 4975(c) of the Code by virtue of an individual administrative
exemption, Prohibited Transaction Exemption 83&hyph;172 (PTE 83&hyph;172, 48 FR 48880, October 21, 1983).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interests of the Plan for all purposes under the Prior Lease were represented by the Trustee, which served to monitor,
on behalf of the Plan, the performance of the Employer under the Prior Lease, and to represent the Plan in the enforcement
of its terms and conditions. The Trustee represents that the Employer occupied the Property in compliance with all
terms and conditions of the Prior Lease for its duration. The Prior Lease expired on December 31, 1993.

A proposed amendment to the Prior Lease was the subject of an additional individual administrative exemption, PTE
86&hyph;113 (51 FR 32556, September 12, 1986), involving the proposed construction of an addition to the Building
and its proposed purchase by the Plan. The Employer represents that the subject amendment to the Prior Lease was never
consummated because the Employer chose not to construct the addition to the Building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Because the Plan's lease of the Property to the Employer continues to constitute a favorable Plan investment, providing
the Plan with a good rate of return under protective arrangements, and because it continues to constitute an advantageous
arrangement for the Employer, the Trustee and the Employer desired that the Plan continue leasing the Property to
the Employer after December 31, 1993, under substantially the same conditions as those of the Prior Lease. Accordingly,
the Trustee and the Employer have agreed to a new lease (the New Lease), effective January 1, 1994, which provides for
the Plan's continued lease of the Property to the Employer, and they are requesting an exemption for the New Lease under
the terms and conditions described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The New Lease is a triple net lease for a term of ten years commencing January 1, 1994 and ending December 31, 2003.
The interests of the Plan under the New Lease for all purposes are represented by the Trustee. The annual rental under
the New Lease is payable in equal monthly installments. Initial rental under the New Lease is $6,000 per month, which
is the fair market rental value of the Property as of the commencement of the New Lease, as determined by Richard Kahler
(Kahler), a professional real property appraiser in Rapid City, South Dakota. The amount of annual rental paid under
the New Lease will be reevaluated every year by the Trustee, and will be increased in accordance with any increases
in the Property's fair market rental value, as determined by the Trustee. In no event will the annual rental be decreased
under the New Lease. On the fifth anniversary of the New Lease, the Trustee will provide for a new appraisal of the Property
and its fair market rental value by an independent professional real estate appraiser of the Trustee's choice. The
New Lease requires the Employer to pay all repair and maintenance costs of the Property except with respect to necessary
major capital improvements to the Building, its roof, or its electrical, heating, cooling or plumbing systems in
excess of $5,000 in any calendar year. Any such excess over $5,000 will be the responsibility of the Plan. The New Lease
requires the Employer to pay all real estate taxes on the Property and to carry fire, extended coverage, and public
liability insurance on the Property in amounts acceptable to the Trustee with the Plan as the named insured. Under
the New Lease the Employer will indemnify and hold the Plan harmless from all penalties, claims demands, liabilities,
expenses and losses of any nature arising from the Employer's use of the Property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Trustee, which represents the Plan for all purposes under the New Lease, will monitor on behalf of the Plan the
Employer's performance under the New Lease and will represent the Plan in the enforcement of its terms and conditions.
The Trustee represents that it has reviewed and evaluated the Plan's continued lease of the Property to the Employer
under the New Lease and has determined that it is in the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the
Plan. Specifically, the Trustee states that the Employer has proven to be a successful, reliable tenant of the Property
and that the Property constitutes the best and most highly productive of all Plan asset investments. The Property
was appraised for its fair market value as of December 1, 1993 by Kahler, who represents that as of that date the Property
had a fair market value of $607,500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicants represent that the subject transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (1) The New Lease is a triple net lease requiring the Employer to pay costs of repair
and maintenance and all taxes and insurance on the Property; (2) The interests of the Plan under the New Lease are represented
by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor and enforce the Employer's performance under the New
Lease; (3) The New Lease ensures that the rental payments will remain no less than the fair market rental value of the
Property for the duration of the New Lease; and (4) The Trustee has reviewed the Plan's continued lease of the Property
to the Employer under the New Lease and has determined that it is a highly desirable investment for the Plan.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission).
Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section
2710(d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to
publish, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, approved class III gaming ordinances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming
activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key
employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a
notice of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B).
Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests
can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St. NW., suite 250, Washington, DC 20036.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;4 and NPF&hyph;7 issued to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of the North Anna Power Station, Units 1 and 2 (NA&hyph;1&amp;2) located in Louisa County, Virginia.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would revise the limitations on concentrations of radioactive material released in liquid effluents
and the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in gaseous effluents, and reflect
the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302. These changes are in response to the
new 10 CFR part 20. The review of an additional item, to revise the definition of ``UNRESTRICTED AREA'', was not completed
and consequently is not included in the amendment. It will be addressed by separate correspondence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, Appendix
I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision does not change the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS)
as a dose rate to the maximally exposed number of the public. Therefore, there will be no increase in the types or amounts
of effluents that may be released offsite, nor an increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures.
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated
with the proposed changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wih regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
impacts associated with the proposed changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission's staff has concluded that there is no significant environmental impact associated with the
proposed changes to the TS, any alternative to the amendments will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This
would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in connection with the Final Environmental
Statement related to the operation of NA&hyph;1&amp;2, dated April 1973.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff consulted with the State of Virginia regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=41 g=1 f=1 -->

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;458]</RINDOCK>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee) for operation of the River Bend Station
located in St. Francisville, LA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would grant one-time extensions for certain technical specification (TS) surveillances
which are currently required to be performed beginning February 16, 1994. The licensee is requesting extension of
the surveillance intervals because the current operating cycle has been extended, impacting the required completion
dates for these surveillances. Performance of these surveillances within the required intervals would require
that the plant be placed in an undesirable operating configuration, or would necessitate a plant shutdown. The surveillances
for which extensions have been requested will be performed during the fifth refueling outage, scheduled to begin
on April 16, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The licensee's amendment request
dated December 8, 1993, contains a detailed list of the specific surveillances for which it is requesting extensions.
For the purposes of addressing the no significant hazards consideration determination, the staff has categorized
the surveillances by groups in the following discussion. The licensee's determination of no significant hazards
is summarized below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change would not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first group of surveillances includes calibration, logic system functional testing (LSFT), and response time
testing of reactor protection system (RPS), isolation actuation system, and emergency core cooling system (ECCS)
instrumentation; and calibration of control rod block, remote shutdown and accident monitoring, and feedwater
system/main turbine trip system instrumentation. The licensee identified vendor and topical reports which support
longer surveillance intervals for certain instruments and elimination of surveillance tests from TS for other instruments.
The licensee also stated that observed drift characteristics, as well as the presence of redundant and diverse channels
for most of the affected instrumentation, support extension of these surveillance intervals. The affected surveillances
are associated with equipment that is also subject to channel checks and/or functional tests which will continue
to be performed during the extension period and should ensure that these systems will perform as designed. Based on
the above, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur
as a result of extending the surveillance intervals by the relatively short time periods requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next group of surveillances concern demonstration of automatic isolation of reactor water cleanup (RWCU) system
containment isolation valves on receipt of an isolation test signal. Due to redundancy provided in the design of the
penetrations, periodic testing of the containment isolation system performed during power operation, and the short
period of time for which the interval extension is requested, no significant increase in the probability or consequences
of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending this surveillance interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third group of surveillances concern inspection, service tests, and performance tests of dc batteries; and load
tests of the battery chargers. Due to the fact that the testing history for the batteries and chargers has been good,
the (nominally) weekly pilot cell data has indicated no degradation, and the short period of time the interval is being
extended, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur
as a result of extending these surveillance intervals.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fourth group of surveillances concern calibration of RPS electrical protection assembles (EPAs). Based on the
inherent lack of drift of the EPAs and the accuracy of the system logic, no significant increase in the probability
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending these surveillance intervals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee also proposed reestablishment of the baseline for the ``N times 18 months'' cumulative surveillance
interval for response time testing by extending the cumulative surveillance interval to coincide with the individual
extensions discussed above. Extension of the cumulative interval would not be for more than the individual extensions
requested. Due to the fact that the individual extensions have been shown to present no significant increase in risk
as discussed above, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident
would occur as a result of extending the cumulative surveillance interval for response time testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extension of the surveillance intervals will not result in any changes in plant configuration or operation. Therefore,
the extensions will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated or analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons cited in Criterion 1 above, the proposed changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin
of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P&hyph;223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing

<DOCTITLE>North Atlantic Energy Service Corp.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;86, issued to North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (the licensee), for operation of the
Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would change the Seabrook Station, Unit 1 (Seabrook) Technical Specifications (TS) to permit
operation of the Seabrook core with an expanded axial flux difference (AFD) band from that currently permitted. Operation
with the expanded AFD band is supported by continuous monitoring of core power distribution using the fixed incore
detector system. Other TS changes allow for fuel design enhancements. The changes to the TS include modification
to a number of safety analysis input parameters and assumptions as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed licensee amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Exeter Public Library, 47 Front Street, Exeter, New Hampshire
03833. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

This notice is to inform the public that the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is terminating
Byproduct Material License Number 31&hyph;26394&hyph;01 issued to Old Vic, Inc. (formerly Victoreen Incorporated)
in Cleveland, Ohio. Victoreen Incorporated (Victoreen) used radioactive materials, at its Woodland Avenue facility,
for conducting research, instrument calibration, and manufacturing of electronic components, from 1965 until
1987. Victoreen began decommissioning the facility in October 1988. To clarify ownership of the facility and the
responsibility for decommissioning, on March 30, 1992, the Commission issued a license to Old Vic, Inc., and terminated
Victoreen's license. The Old Vic, Inc., site on Woodland Avenue is listed on the Commission's Site Decommissioning
Management Plan. In November 1993, Old Vic, Inc., completed the decommissioning. Based on the remedial actions taken
by the licensee, the Commission's staff's review of the licensee's termination surveys, and the results of the Commission's
confirmatory surveys, the Commission concludes that decommissioning activities are complete and the site is suitable
for unrestricted use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This termination will be reopened only if additional contamination, or noncompliance with the decommissioning
plan, is found indicating a significant threat to public health and safety. Noncompliance would occur if the licensee
had not complied with an approved decommissioning plan or had provided false information.

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;59 issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee) for operation of the James
A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant located in Oswego County, New York. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would add Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) and Surveillance Requirements to Tables
3.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler Protected Areas'', and 4.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler System Tests'' and clarify
the associated Bases to reflect the installation of a new full area fire suppression system in the east and west cable
tunnels. This new full area fire suppression system was installed because the previous sprinkler system did not provide
coverage to some cable trays and the sprinkler head orientation did not provide full coverage of the cable trays where
it was installed. The proposed amendment would also correct other portions of Tables 3.12.1 and 4.12.1 for consistency
with changes made to reflect the east and west cable tunnel modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes revise the Technical Specifications to incorporate a modification to the James A. FitzPatrick
Fire Protection System and to make existing Technical Specifications consistent with the specifications proposed
for the modification. The modification will improve the ability of the plant's fire protection system to detect and
suppress fires. The modified system has been designed, analyzed and constructed in accordance with fire protection
system requirements. These changes to the Technical Specifications assure that the modified system is operable
by periodic surveillance and that required actions are taken if it is not available. The surveillance requirements
meet or exceed past requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only potential for a new or different type of accident arises from different failure mechanisms of the system.
An analysis of flooding has demonstrated that there are no associated failures of shutdown equipment. The new system
has been designed and constructed so that there is no damage to safety related equipment due to missiles or water spray.
The modification to the first protection system provides additional protection for possible fires in the east and
west cable tunnels through increased spray coverage. There are no changes to plant operations or operating procedures
other than Surveillance Requirements. The Surveillance Requirements are consistent with past plant practices
and industry codes and standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The piping has been designed and constructed to prevent damage to safety related equipment due to missiles or water
spray during a seismic event. The modification improves the plant's capability to detect and suppress fires. The
potential for flooding or water damage has been evaluated and does not result in failure of shutdown equipment. The
LCO and Surveillance Requirements meet or exceed past practice. This change results in no reduction in the margin
of safety.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Penfield Library, State University College of New York, Oswego,
NY 13126. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Robert A. Capra: Petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Charles M. Pratt, Power Authority of the State of New York, 1633 Broadway, New York, NY
10019, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted for OMB approval, proposal of Rule
18f&hyph;3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a) (the ``Investment Company Act''), Forms N&hyph;1A
and N&hyph;14 under the Investment Company Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) (the ``Securities Act''), and proposed amendments to rule 34b&hyph;1 under the Investment Company Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed rule 18f&hyph;3 would permit any registered open-end management investment company that satisfies its
conditions to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities but having
different arrangements for shareholder services, distribution, or both. Proposed rule 18f&hyph;3 would require
that a multiple class fund adopt a written plan setting forth the different class arrangements. The Commission estimates
that approximately 675 registered open-end, management investment companies would use proposed rule 18f&hyph;3
and that the annual reporting burden would be approximately one hour per respondent, for a total of about 675 burden
hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also is proposing amendments to Forms N&hyph;1A and N&hyph;14 and rule 34b&hyph;1 that would require
certain disclosure by multiple class funds and feeder funds in master-feeder structures about the classes or feeders
not offered in the prospectus, or sales literature. Form N&hyph;1A is the registration statement used by open-end
management investment companies other than small business investment companies and insurance company separate
accounts. The average additional burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N&hyph;1A is estimated to be .4
hours per registrant for a total of about 1,080 additional burden hours. Thus, the total annual burden for Form N&hyph;1A
per registrant would become 1059.96 hours per registrant and the total for all registrants would be 2,861,892 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form N&hyph;14 is the registration statement used by investment companies to register under the Securities Act securities
to be issued in mergers and other forms of business combination. By cross-referencing a number of items in Form N&hyph;1A,
Form N&hyph;14 requires disclosure of some of the same information regarding the management investment companies
involved in the transaction. Approximately 95 registrants filed Form N&hyph;14 in 1992, with an estimated compliance
time of 2,500 hours per registrant. The maximum additional burden imposed by the amendments is estimated to be .3 hours
per registrant for a total additional burden of 28.5 additional hours for all registrants. The total annual burden
for Form N&hyph;14 would be 2,500.3 hours per registrant and 237,528.5 hours for all registrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 34b&hyph;1 governs the use of performance information in investment company sales literature. In 1992, approximately
287 respondents used performance data in their sales literature and rule 34b&hyph;1 imposed a total annual burden
of 3,444 hours on those respondents. The proposed amendment to rule 34b&hyph;1 would impose an average additional
burden of .3 hours per response on those 287 respondents, each of which makes approximately five responses per year,
for a total additional annual burden of 430.5 hours. Thus, the total annual burden imposed by rule 34b&hyph;1 would
become 3,874.5 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In total, proposed rule 18f&hyph;3, and the proposed amendments to Forms N&hyph;1A and N&hyph;14 would impose an
additional total burden on all respondents of 2,214 hours. The estimated average burden hours are made solely for
the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative study
of the costs of Commission rules and forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct general comments to Gary Waxman at the address below. Direct any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated
average burden hours for compliance with the Commission rules and forms to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer,
Office of Management and Budget.

The Amex submitted a letter to the Commission adding proposed Commentary .03(d) to Rule 111, Restrictions on Registered
Traders, to state that members who are not regular members (as defined in Article IV of the Amex Constitution) may enter
orders in accordance with Commentary .03, as described below, only in securities which members of their class are
otherwise entitled to trade while on the Floor of the Exchange. Amendment No. 1 also would amend Rule 950(c), Floor
Rules Applicable to Options, to provide that Rule 111 and certain of its commentaries shall apply to options transactions.

The Amex submitted a letter to the Commission requesting that its proposed amendment to Rule 170, Commentary .02,
which would permit specialists to liquidate positions in specialty stocks on zero destabilizing ticks without Floor
Official approval, be withdrawn from the instant proposed rule change. See letter from Claudia Crowley, Special
Counsel, Legal and Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Mary Revell, Branch Chief, Exchange Branch, Division of
Market Regulation, Commission, dated May 29, 1992. Proposed Rule 170 was refiled in File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;26.

Amendment No. 3 proposes additional changes to Rules 7, 108(c), 115 and 131(h). The proposed changes include: minor
revisions to Rule 7, Commentary .01, in order to conform the reprint of Exchange Act Rule 10a&hyph;1 contained in the
rule to its actual text; changes to Amex Rule 108(c), to include a citation to Section 11(a) of the Exchange Act; minor

The Commission has carefully reviewed the Amex's proposed rule changes and concludes that the proposed changes are
consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities
exchange and, in particular, with sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8), 11(b), and 11A(a)(1) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission supports the Amex's efforts to continue to review the form and substance of market trading regulation
in response to changes in market structure. The Commission believes that it is important to market quality that the
Exchange have a regulatory program that is tailored to the current market structure. The Commission believes that
the proposed rule changes will be helpful in updating the Amex market structure and trading rules and will further
the purposes of the Act.

The Exchange proposes the following such changes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Rule 2_Visitors: Currently, this rule refers to the admission of visitors to the ``Gallery'' and the ``Trading Floor.''
The Commission agrees that since the ``Gallery'' has been non-existent for many years, reference to it should be deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules 6 and 550_Execution of Bonds on Exchange and Secondary Distributions: Currently, these rules refer to the ``Rulings
and Inquiries Department'' as the department at the Amex to be contacted relative to those rules. Such department
no longer exists (``Rulings'' and ``Inquiries'' are separate departments). The Commission therefore agrees that
the reference should be changed to the ``Rulings Department.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 7_Short Sales: Commentary .01 is a reprint of Exchange Act Rule 10a&hyph;1. The Exchange states that the reprint
is an outdated version of the Commission rule and should be revised. Amendment No. 3 proposed minor language changes
to conform the reprint of Exchange Act Rule 10a&hyph;1, which is contained in Commentary .01 of the rule, to its official
format. The Commission believes that the proposed amendment makes appropriate conforming changes and should therefore
be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 22_Authority of Floor Officials: This rule contains a cross reference which lists seventeen rules upon which
Floor Officials may rule. Currently, however, there are at least three other rules relating to the duties and powers
of floor officials which are not included in the list, and with future rule revisions, additional rules will provide
for Floor Official involvement. Rather than attempt to provide an all-inclusive list, the Amex proposes that the
cross reference in Rule 22 be deleted. The Commission believes that the proposed changes are appropriate and should
therefore be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 134_Cash and Seller's Option Transactions: This rule requires Floor Official oversight for two transactions
that are not ``regular way''_``cash'' and ``seller's option'' transactions. Although ``next day'' transactions
are also not ``regular way'' transactions, they are not included in the rule. The Exchange states that this appears
to have been an oversight at the time Rule 124 was revised to permit ``any additional settlement periods as the Exchange
may from time to time determine.'' Therefore, the Commission agrees that ``next day'' transactions should be referred
to in Rule 134.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 178_Responsibility of Specialist: This rule establishes the liability for losses in those situations where
a member firm has not received a report from the specialist on an order that was executed or should have been executed.
The Exchange states that time-frames cited in the current rule are no longer appropriate in view of the time limits
set forth in Rule 719 regarding ``Next Day Comparison of Exchange Transactions.'' The Commission agrees that Rule
178 should therefore be revised to conform its time limits to Rule 719.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 179_Orders in Rights: Because this rule also applies to warrants, the title of this rule should be redesignated
as ``Orders in Rights and Warrants.'' The Commission agrees that this change is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules 419 and 420_Statements of Accounts and Mailing Statements: Commentaries to both rules refer to ``Membership
Compliance Division.'' The Exchange states that the correct title of that division is ``Compliance and Surveillance
Division'' and the commentaries to both rules should be revised to reflect that title. The Commission agrees that
these changes are appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 560 (i)_Special Offerings and Special Bids: Paragraph (i) incorporates the provisions of former Article VI,
which governed floor brokerage commissions, into Rule 560. The Exchange states that Paragraph (i), however, should
be deleted since Article VI, to which it relates, was rescinded in 1976. The Commission agrees that this change is appropriate.

The Amex proposes to amend other rules so that such rules either conform to similar NYSE Rules, are made clear, or are
responsive to current market conditions. The Commission believes that these rule changes are also appropriate and
logical revisions to Amex Rules. These rule changes are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 103(a)_Dealings When Option Granted or Held: Rule 103(a) prohibits a member, while on the floor, from buying
or selling any stock if the member or his firm holds or has granted an option to buy or sell the stock. This rule was adopted
prior to 1961. In December 1985, Exchange Act Rule 175 was revised to permit a stock specialist to hedge his stock position
with options.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange asserts that Rule 103(a) should, therefore, similarly be revised to permit a stock specialist to engage
in listed options transactions to hedge his stock position.

while on the floor, from executing or causing to be executed on the Exchange
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 any transaction for the purchase or sale of any security with respect to which transaction such member is vested with
discretion as to the choice of a security to be bought or sold, the total amount of any security to be bought or sold, or

a transaction for a bona fide cash investment account or for the account of a person who due to illness, absence, etc.,
is unable to effect transactions for his own account. It is proposed that the exceptions be deleted since they are not
appropriate in today's market. The NYSE has adopted a similar revision to a comparable rule.

Rules 110 and 111_Registered Traders and Restrictions on Registered Traders: These rules, which provide that only
members registered as traders may trade for their own accounts while on the Trading Floor, were adopted in 1964 to restrict
on-floor transactions by floor members, who, it was believed, had trading advantages due to their presence on the
trading floor when market news unfolded, and due to their ability to quickly react to such information. The Exchange
believes that since current communications technology makes information readily available to off-floor market
participants, there is no reason to continue to so restrict members' on-floor orders.

The Amex proposes to both add and delete language from Commentary .02 to Rule 111. Amex Rule 111, Commentary .02 says
that the Rule 111 provisions do not apply to transactions initiated by registered traders for an account in which they
have an interest, ``unless such transactions, although originated off the floor, are deemed on-floor transactions
under the provisions of these Rules.'' The Exchange proposes to delete the aforementioned quoted text from Commentary
.02. The Exchange proposes to add the following to Rule 111, Commentary .02: ``However, an off-floor order for an account
in which a member has an interest is to be treated as an on-floor order if it is executed by the member who initiated it.''
The Commission believes that the changes to Commentary .02 to Rule 111 are appropriate clarifying changes to the Rule,
and that these changes will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
Act, in accordance with section 6(b)(8) of the Act.

The Amex propose to rescind the current Rule 111, Commentary .03 and adopt a new Commentary .03 (a) through (d).
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Such new commentary will permit members, while on the trading floor, to enter orders for their own accounts provided
that such orders are entered through an on-floor communications facility and sent to an off-floor clearing firm's
order room where a time-stamped record of the order is maintained before the order is retransmitted to the trading
floor.

Proposed Commentary .03(a) generally provides that a member using a communication facility on the floor of the Exchange
to enter an order for his own account shall be deemed to be initiating an off-floor order if such order is routed through
a clearing firm's order room, where a time-stamped record of the order is maintained, before such order is re-transmitted
to the floor for execution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Commentary .03(b) generally provides that any order entered by a member for any account in which it (or its
officer, allied member or employee) is directly or indirectly interested, or for any discretionary account serviced
by the member organization, following a conversation with the member or employee in that organization who is on the
floor, shall be deemed to be an off-floor order, provided that such order is transmitted to the floor through an order
room or other facility regularly used for the transmission of public orders to the floor; where a time-stamped record
of the order is maintained; or an exception is available in Rule 111 (f), (g), or (h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that proposed Commentary .03 (a) and (b) to Rule 111 (Restrictions on Registered Traders)
are substantially similar to those made to NYSE Rule 112.10 (Orders Initiated ``Off the Floor'') and those made to
NYSE Rule 112.20 (``On the Floor'' and ``Off the Floor''); therefore the rationale for approval of both sets of rules
is substantially the same. The Commission finds that the rules dealing with on-floor orders provide a practical means
for a member on the floor to enter an order for his own account without having to physically leave the floor, as is currently
necessary. The Commission further finds that the amendments to Rule 111, Commentary .03 (a) and (b) more accurately
reflect the status of on and off-floor orders. The Commission believes that the requirement of routing on-floor orders
upstairs and then back down to the floor will continue to prevent any undue advantage of floor immediacy from accruing
to orders designated as off-floor.

time to time adopt and make known to its members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that, like the similar NYSE Rule (112.20(d)), proposed Commentary .03(c) to Rule 111 promotes
conduct consistent with just and equitable principles of trade, in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, by
explicitly incorporating the frontrunning policy into rules governing competitive trader conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Commentary .03(d) generally provides that members who are not regular members (as described in Article
IV of the Exchange Constitution) may enter orders in accordance with the Commentary .03 only in securities which members
of their class are otherwise entitled to trade while on the floor of the Exchange. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that Commentary .03(d) (along with Rule 950(c)) is appropriate in order to ensure that members
other than registered traders, such as limited trading option permit holders, may enter orders for their accounts
while on the floor.

Rule 110_Registered Traders: In addition to the changes made to Rule 111, the Exchange also proposes to amend Rule
110 to add a reference to Rule 111. As amended, Rule 110 would provide that members may not initiate a transaction while
on the floor for an account in which they have an interest unless the member is registered as a registered trader with
the Exchange, except as provided in Rule 111, Commentary .03. The Commission believes that this revision permits
Rule 110 to maintain its proper relationship with Rule 111 as revised. The NYSE has adopted similar revisions to its
comparable rules.

Rule 115_Exchange Procedures for Use of Unusual Market Exception: The Exchange proposes to add a new Commentary to

Rule 115 to the requirements of Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1. The Exchange therefore proposes that Commentary .02 be added to

The Commission believes that the addition of the word ``expiring'' to Rule 124(b) is appropriate to clarify that the

Rule 131(a)_Types of Orders_Market Orders: Rule 131(a) provides that a market order to buy or sell a stated amount
of a security at the most advantageous price obtainable after the order is represented in the trading crowd. Rule 131(a)
further provides that the responsibilities of brokers handling market, limited price, at the close, and not held
orders are set forth in Rule 156. It is proposed that ``switch orders'' be included in the reference to the orders brokers
handle. This revision follows the inclusion of such orders in Rule 156. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Rule 131(f)_Types of Orders_At the Opening Order: It is proposed that the phrase ``at the opening of the stock'' be

incorporates into the rule a policy that is currently in effect on the Exchange. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that because the proposed amendment would clarify the definition of an at-the-opening order,
it should be approved. The Commission agrees with the Exchange that the clarifications to the definition of ``at-the-opening-only''
orders should help remove any misconceptions about when such orders are eligible for execution. Accordingly, the
proposed rule change clarifies that while an ``at-the-opening-only'' order is eligible to be executed only on an
opening trade, such an order is not cancelled if the stock opens with a quotation rather than a trade. In addition, the
NYSE has revised its comparable rule in the same manner.

Rule 131(h)_Do not reduce orders (``DNR''): Rule 131(h) relates to DNR orders, which are not reduced to reflect ordinary
cash dividends but are reduced for other distributions such as when a stock goes ``ex'' a stock dividend or ex rights.
Currently, the rule defines DNR orders to include a limited order to buy, or a stop limit order to sell a round lot or odd
lot or a stop order to sell an odd lot which is not to be reduced by the amount of an ordinary cash dividend on the ex-dividend
date. The rule further provides that a DNR order applies only to ordinary cash dividends; it should be reduced for other
distributions such as when a stock goes ``ex'' a stock dividend or ex rights. The proposed change would add ``a stop
order to sell'' to the list of DNR orders. The Exchange would also add ``a special cash dividend'' to the list which provides
when a DNR order should be reduced for other distributions.

Rule 131(i)_Types of Orders_Fill or Kill: The definition of a ``fill or kill'' order in this paragraph includes a reference
to two other types of orders, ``immediate or cancel'' and ``all or none.'' The Exchange believes that these references
incorrectly suggest that such orders are comparable in nature when these three types of orders have unique characteristics.
For instance, a ``fill or kill'' order is to be executed in its entirety on presentation in the crowd or immediately
cancelled. ``Immediate or cancel'' orders require an immediate execution of all or part of the order with the balance
cancelled. The ``all or none'' order is to be executed in its entirety in one transaction but is not cancelled if not
executed immediately on presentation in the crowd. It is therefore proposed that the reference to ``immediate or
cancel'' and ``all or none'' orders be deleted, because this paragraph of the rule is not applicable to those types
of orders.

Rule 131(l)_Types of Orders_Not Held Order: Currently, Rule 131(l) defines a not held order as a market or limited
price order marked ``not held,'' ``disregard tape,'' ``take time,'' or which bears any such qualifying notation.
The Exchange proposes that orders marked ``buy on the print'' or ``sell on the print'' be included in the types of orders
deemed to be ``not held orders'' because by their terms, these orders can only be executed if a print takes place at its
limit. The Exchange further asserts that as with other ``not held'' orders, there are no assurances that the broker
handling the order will be able to execute the order at that same price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that ``buy or sell on print'' orders are appropriately classified as ``not held'' orders
because brokers cannot guarantee execution at the designated ``print' price. Classifying such orders as ``not held''
orders should serve to put customers on notice that they bear the price risk of an execution at a price other than the
``print'' price. The Commission approved a similar revision to the comparable NYSE Rule.

Rule 135_Cancellations: Currently, Rule 135 only permits a member or member organization to cancel a transaction
if it was made in error or for other proper reason, and unless in each case prior approval of the cancellation is obtained
from a Floor Official. The Exchange states that this permits unilateral cancellations. The Exchange proposes that
Rule 135 be revised to provide that a member may only cancel or revise a transaction if it was made in error or the cancellation
or revision is for other proper reason, and unless both the buying and selling members agree to the cancellation or
revision, and prior approval of the cancellation or revision is obtained from a Floor Official. The Exchange also
proposes that the title of the rule be revised to indicate that the rule relates to revisions in, as well as cancellations
of, transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange further proposes to amend Commentary .02 to Rule 135 to require that when a transaction is not cancelled
but the member intends to assume for his or her own account the contract made for a customer, the provisions of Rule 390
apply, and any required consent of the Exchange under that rule is to be obtained from the Compliance and Surveillance
Division instead of through the Membership Compliance Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the proposal should be approved because it will increase oversight of cancellations
or revisions as well as prevent unilateral cancellations. The proposal is modeled after the comparable NYSE Rule
(NYSE Rule 128B.10_Publication on the tape or in the sales sheet) which requires the cancellation of a transaction
to be agreed to by both sides of the transaction in question in addition to obtaining the approval of a Floor Official.
In addition, the change in designation in Commentary .02 to the Compliance and Surveillance Division is necessary
so that this rule identifies the appropriate Division governing the regulated conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 154, Commentary .03_Orders Left With Specialist: Commentary .03 provides that specialists may not accept ``not
held'' orders or orders with such qualifications as ``keep the best bid or offer,'' ``disregard tape,'' ``take time,''
and scale orders without specific amounts and prices orders. The Exchange proposes that Commentary .03 be revised
to include ``buy on the print'' and ``sell on the print'' as additional types of orders which a specialist is prohibited
from accepting because under Rule 131, a ``buy on the print'' or ``sell on the print'' order is deemed to be a ``not held''
order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that this change is an appropriate ``housekeeping'' amendment that should be approved in
conjunction with approval of the proposed amendment to Rule 131.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 154, Commentaries .06 and .07_Orders Left With Specialist: Current Commentary .06 provides that all good `til
cancelled (``G.T.C.'') orders on a specialist's book must be cancelled on such periodic dates as may be prescribed
by the Exchange, unless properly confirmed or renewed as prescribed by the Exchange. The Amex proposes to delete current
Commentary .06. Current Commentary .07 requires specialists to return receipt stubs of G.T.C. orders, cancellations
and confirmations on the same day in which they are received and it requires specialists to return receipt stubs of
periodic confirmations of renewals promptly as prescribed by the Exchange. Current Commentary .07 also requires
confirmations of cancellations of orders and confirmations or renewals of G.T.C. orders to be dated, and duplicate
receipt stubs to be maintained by specialists. The Exchange proposes to delete references to the return of receipt
stubs of periodic confirmation or renewals in Commentary .07 which will be renumbered as .06.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange also proposes to delete the requirement that receipt stubs be signed by the specialists. In accordance
with the amendment, specialists will just have to stamp their name on such receipts. Finally, the Exchange proposes
to delete the requirements that confirmations or renewals of G.T.C. orders be dated and duplicate receipt stubs kept
for them. The Exchange states that these proposed changes are based upon the NYSE's recision of its Rule 123A.55 which
had required the periodic confirmation of G.T.C. orders on the specialist's book.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange also states that these provisions are unnecessary in view of the automated recordkeeping ability of
member firms.

order handling provisions and to bring the Amex Rules into line with automated exchange systems. These changes are
in accordance with section 11A(a)(1) of the Act which provides that new data processing and communications techniques
create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market operations. The changes to Commentary .06 and .07
will also promote equitable principles of trade and serve the public good in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the
Act
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 by helping to create a more efficient marketplace.

Rule 154, Commentary .14_Orders Left With Specialist: Commentary .14 provides that a stop limit order to sell a round
lot or odd lot, which has been elected but not executed before the ex-dividend date is treated the same as an open limited
price order to sell and such orders are not to be reduced by the specialist or odd-lot dealer on ex-date unless otherwise
instructed. The Exchange states that such commentary is valid as it applies to cash dividends, but is inappropriate
where other than cash dividends are involved. The Exchange also states that such orders, pursuant to Rule 132 (price
adjustment of open orders on ``ex-date''), are to be adjusted as are all other orders to reflect stock dividends or
stock distributions. The Amex, therefore, proposes to amend this commentary to state that such orders are not to be
reduced by the specialist or odd-lot dealer for a cash dividend but will be adjusted for stock dividends and stock distributions
on ex-date in accordance with Rule 132 unless otherwise instructed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that this amendment is a logical ``housekeeping'' amendment which should be approved as
it promotes just and equitable principles of trade pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 155_Precedence Accorded to Orders Entrusted to Specialists: This rule requires that a specialist give precedence
to orders entrusted to him as an agent in any stock in which he is registered before executing at the same price any purchase
or sale in the same stock for an account in which the specialist has an interest. The Exchange states that since Exchange
Act Rule 11a1&hyph;1 became effective, the aforementioned requirement is not universal and therefore several exemptions
apply. The specialist is not required to refrain from trading for his own account when in possession of inexecutable
``G'' orders. Also, the Rule 155 requirements do not apply to on-floor orders subject to the ``two-tick'' restriction
and unelected percentage orders. The Amex proposes that this rule be amended to state that the general requirement
that a specialist yield precedence under Rule 155 does not apply in these three situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the amendment to Rule 155 should be approved because it will conform Exchange Rules to
Exchange Act Rule 11a1&hyph;1 and clarify the application of Rule 155, thereby promoting just and equitable principles
of trade pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

Rule 156_Representation of Orders: Currently, Rule 156 sets forth a broker's responsibility for the handling of
``market,'' ``limited price,'' ``at the close'' and ``not held'' orders. The Amex proposes that this rule be amended
(by adding paragraph (e)) to include a broker's responsibility for the handling of ``switch orders'' and to provide
that a broker may handle a ``switch order'' on a ``best efforts'' basis. The Exchange states that this proposal recognizes
the difficulties a member may encounter in executing this type of order since it requires the execution of orders in
different securities at the same time at a designated price difference.

The Commission believes that this amendment to Rule 156 should be approved because ``switch orders'' are appropriately
defined under the category of ``representation of orders,'' and because allowing ``switch orders'' to be handled
on a ``best efforts'' basis reflects current market realities, thereby helping to ensure efficient execution of
securities transactions pursuant to section 11A(a)(1) of the Act. The NYSE has similarly revised its comparable
rule.

Rule 950(c)_Floor Rules Applicable to Options_Rules of General Applicability: This paragraph provides that, with
certain exceptions, the restrictions on Registered Traders as imposed by Rule 111 will apply to the trading of options.
The Amex proposes to extend the proposed amendment to Rule 111, to permit members while on the Floor to enter orders
in a manner that permits them to be deemed ``off-Floor'' orders, to options trading. The Exchange states that because
it has determined that there is no reason why the proposed revisions to Rule 111 should not be applicable to transactions
in non-equity securities as well as equity securities, the Exchange proposes to revise Rule 950(c) accordingly.

The Amex originally proposed to revise Rule 111 to apply only to equity trading. The Amex, in amendment No. 1 to the rule

Rule 950(e)_Floor Rules Applicable to Options_Rules of General Applicability: This provision sets forth the types
of orders, in addition to the orders in Rule 131, that apply to options transactions. The Amex proposes to add a commentary
to Rule 950(e) to clarify that ``at the opening'' orders in options are executable in whole or in part at the opening
rotation in the pertinent option and that any such order or the portion thereof not so executed is to be treated as cancelled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the addition of Commentary .01 to Rule 950(e) is appropriate as it will clarify the manner
in which ``at the opening'' orders in options are executable. This change will therefore serve to promote just and
equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

Rule 950(h), Commentary .05_Floor Rules Applicable to Options_Rules of General Applicability: Paragraph (h) of
Rule 950 makes the specialist financial requirements contained in Rule 171 applicable to options trading. Commentary
.05 to Rule 950(h), which details how the financial requirements are computed for options specialists, requires
an option specialist to maintain twenty option contracts for each class of options in which he or she is registered.
Rule 171, however, was revised several years ago to require specialists to ``maintain a cash or liquid asset position
in the amount of $600,000 or an amount sufficient to assume a position of sixty trading units of each security in which
such specialist is registered *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 That rule previously required specialists to assume a position of twenty trading units. The Exchange states that,
because Rule 171 now refers to sixty rather than twenty trading units, Commentary .05 should be amended accordingly.
The Amex, therefore, proposes to amend Commentary .05 to require that a specialist maintain sixty options contracts
of each class of options in which he or she is registered.

Rule 959_Accommodation Transactions. This rule provides a ``cabinet'' trading facility for the trading of options
which are out of the money to the extent that there is no buying interest at the minimum price at which options trade (1/16
of $1 or $.06&hyph;1/2 per underlying share). Orders to sell at $1 per contract ($.01 per underlying share) may be entered
in the cabinet subject to a number of restrictions, including the requirement that only closing orders may be entered
in the ``cabinet.'' Because the rule applies only to orders left in the ``cabinet,'' opening orders may be crossed
in the crowd. The Rule, however, does not provide for this type of transaction. The Amex therefore, proposes that the
rule be amended to provide that opening or closing purchase and sell orders may be executed in the crowd in the absence
of closing purchase or sale orders in the cabinet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believe that this is an appropriate clarifying amendment to Rule 959.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has reviewed carefully the Exchange's proposed rule changes and concludes that, for the above stated
reasons, the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable
to a national securities exchange. The Commission believes that the proposals developed by the Exchange appropriately
balance the competing concerns of various Exchange constituencies in a manner consistent with just and equitable
principles of trade. Given the dynamic nature of competitive forces shaping the national market system, the Commission
strongly supports the Amex's efforts to review and update the structure of market trading regulation in order to maintain
an efficient and meaningful regulatory program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, based upon the aforementioned factors, the Commission finds that the Exchange's proposed rule change
updating its market regulation rules is consistent with sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8), 11(b), and 11A(a)(1) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered
holding company, and its wholly owned non-utility subsidiary company, Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII'') (collectively,
``Applicants''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07074, have filed an application-declaration under
sections 6, 7, 9, 10, 12(b), and 32 of the Act and Rules 45 and 53 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission issued a notice of the filing on January 7, 1994 (HCAR No. 25971) (``January 7th Notice''). In the January
7th notice, EII proposed to acquire a limited partnership interest for $11.5 million in a Canadian limited partnership
(``Partnership'') being formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 22.5 megawatt wood and oil fired cogeneration
facility in Brooklyn, Nova Scotia, Canada (``Project''). Applicants anticipated that the Project would quality
as an exempt wholesale generator as defined by section 32(a)(1) of the Act. EII proposed to secure its equity contribution
to the Partnership through an irrevocable letter of credit for $11.5 million with GPU unconditionally guaranteeing
EII's obligations. Alternatively, should the Partnership elect to borrow $11.5 million from lending institutions
to provide a portion of the construction financing, GPU proposed to guarantee unconditionally EII's repayment obligations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants now propose that GPU make a capital contribution to EII of up to $11.5 million. EII proposes to use such funds
to acquire its interest in the Partnership.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On February
21, 1986, Applicant filed a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A and a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A
which was declared effective on December 23, 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicant has three investment Portfolios, each of which serves as the underlying investment medium for five insurance
company separate accounts that are registered under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The insurance companies
and separate accounts are: Ameritas Variable Life Insurance Company (AVLIC Separate Account); Fidelity Investments
Life Insurance Company (The Fidelity Investments Variable Life Account I); Midland National Life Insurance Company
(Midland National Life Separate Account A); Monarch Life Insurance Company (The Fidelity Variable Account); and
Vermont Variable Life Insurance Company (Vermont Variable Life Insurance Account).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On December 29, 1992, pursuant to an application submitted on behalf of each insurance company and separate account
named in paragraph 2, the Commission granted an order permitting the substitution of shares of two other investment
companies for the shares of Applicant. On December 30, 1992, each insurance company, on behalf of its separate account,
redeemed every share it held in each Portfolio of Applicant at net asset value. On December 31, 1992, Applicant's investment
adviser, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company (``FMR Co.''), redeemed its shares of each Portfolio of Applicant
at net asset value. Together these constituted all the outstanding shares of Applicant. Each Portfolio's securities
consisted solely of zero coupon bonds which were sold on the open market at market value. On January 14, 1993, Applicant's
Board of Trustees adopted a resolution directing that Applicant be deregistered under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicant currently has no assets, has no security holders or shares outstanding, and is in the process of winding
up its affairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicant has not sold its assets or securities to another investment company, nor transferred its assets to any
other trust, nor has it or will it merge into or consolidate with another registered investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicant has no debts. There were no expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation. Any expenses involved
in the dissolution of Applicant as a Massachusetts business trust will be borne by FMR Corp, the parent company or Applicant's
investment adviser, FMR Co.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicant represents that if the order sought herein is granted, it will shortly thereafter file with the Massachusetts
Secretary of Commonwealth the documents necessary to dissolve itself as a Massachusetts business trust, thereby
ceasing to exist as a legal entity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(m) of the Small Business Act authorizes SBA to conduct a Microloan Demonstration Program. The purpose of
the Program is to provide assistance to women, low-income, and minority entrepreneurs, and business owners, and
other such individuals possessing the capability to operate successful business concerns and to assist small business
concerns in those areas suffering from a lack of credit due to economic downturn. Under the Program, SBA is authorized
to make direct loans to qualified intermediary lenders who will use the proceeds to make short-term, fixed rate microloans,
of not more than $25,000, but particularly in amounts averaging $7,500, to start-up, newly established and growing
small business concerns. In conjunction with the loans made to intermediary lenders, SBA may make grants to such intermediary
lenders to be used to provide intensive marketing, management and technical assistance to microloan borrowers under
this Program.

as an intermediary. To be eligible, an organization, inter alia, must be: (a) A private, non-profit entity; or (b)
a private, non-profit, community development corporation; or (c) a consortium of private, non-profit organizations
or private, non-profit community development corporations; or (d) a quasi-governmental economic development
entity, other than a State, county, municipal government or any agency thereof, only if: (1) No application is received
from an otherwise eligible and qualified organization; or (2) the SBA, in its sole discretion, determines that the
needs of a region or geographical area are not adequately served by an otherwise eligible and qualified organization
which: (a) has submitted an application; or (b) has previously been admitted to participate as an intermediary. Further,
an entity meeting one of the above descriptions must have, by itself, at least one year of experience making and servicing
microloans to start-up, newly established, or growing small business concerns, and itself providing, as an integral
part of its microloan program, intensive marketing, management, and technical assistance to its microloan borrowers.
In addition, each intermediary lender is eligible to receive grant funding to support the costs of providing such
technical assistance in an amount of not more than twenty-five percent of the total outstanding balance of the loan
made under this Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those organizations located in the indicated jurisdictions and which believe themselves eligible and which wish
to participate in the Program may obtain a Microloan Demonstration Program Request for Proposals Package by contacting

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. 10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury Department,
15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, on February 1 and 2, 1994, of the following debt management advisory
committee:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on February 1, followed
by a charge by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working
session. On February 2, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on February 1 and will be open to the
public. The remaining sessions on February 1 and the committee's reporting session on February 2 will be closed to
the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. 10(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C.
App. 10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101&hyph;05, that the closed portions of the meeting are
concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest requires
that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice from representatives
of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations. Historically, this
advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major segments of the financial
community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee under 5 U.S.C. App. 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports
of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to
lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed,
and is requesting public comments on, documents presenting proposed Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection
of Benthic Organisms for five priority pollutant (section 307(a)) chemicals, guidelines for deriving these criteria
on a site-specific basis, and the technical basis for deriving the criteria. The criteria documents present data
and criteria for acenaphthene, dieldrin, endrin, fluoranthene and phenanthrene, which were selected for their
known toxicity, hydrophobicity, and persistence. EPA intends to publish each of the documents in final form after
considering public comments, while the general regulatory role Sediment Quality Criteria play will be outlined
in the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy (CSMS) which will be available for public comment in the near future.
The Agency is specifically soliciting comments on the scientific soundness of the criteria development methodology
and the criteria themselves as opposed to their application. Comments received in response to this notice on the intended
uses and implementation of the criteria will be taken into account in preparing the proposed CSMS and other guidance
materials. An exception to this is the potential for the Sediment Quality Criteria to be used as Applicable and Relevant
or Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) under CERCLA. The EPA particularly welcomes comment and discussion on the applicability
and appropriateness of using the criteria as ARARs.

II. Background Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Toxic contaminants in bottom sediments of the nation's lakes, rivers, wetlands, and coastal waters create the potential
for continued environmental impact even where water column contaminant levels comply with established water quality
criteria. In addition, contaminated sediments can have impacts on water quality even when additional pollutants
are no longer being added by any other source. It is intended that sediment quality criteria be protective of benthic
organisms and be used to: assess the extent of sediment contamination, aid in implementing measures that limit or
prevent additional contamination, and identify when appropriate remediation activities are needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 314(a)(1)), directs EPA to develop and publish criteria reflecting
the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic
life, wildlife and recreation. EPA has periodically issued ambinent water quality criteria guidance, beginning
with the publication of ``Water Quality Criteria 1972.'' All criteria guidance through late 1986 was summarized
in an EPA document entitled ``Quality Criteria for Water, 1986.'' EPA has subsequently published, from time to time,
new ambient water quality criteria guidance for additional pollutants or revised existing criteria guidance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's criteria documents are intended to provide a comprehensive toxicological evaluation of each chemical addressed
therein, based on available information. For toxic pollutants, the documents tabulate the numeric acute and chronic
toxicity information for aquatic life and, where sufficient information is available, derive the numeric criteria
maximum concentrations (acute criteria) and the numeric criteria continuous concentrations (chronic criteria)
that the Agency recommends to protect aquatic life resources. The documents also provide recommended criteria to
protect human health. EPA has published numeric aquatic life criteria for 30 priority pollutants and human health
criteria for 91 priority pollutants. Aquatic life criteria address potential water column impacts only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is now proposing sediment quality criteria for five priority pollutant chemicals (endrin, dieldrin, fluoranthene,
phenanthrene, and acenaphthene) that EPA has determined are present in the sediment of the Nation's waters and cause
or have the potential to cause adverse effects to the water column and benthic assemblages and their hierarchical
foodchains including humans. Pursuant to section 104 of the Clean Water Act, the Agency has conducted research, experiments
and demonstrations and has studied the effects of contaminated sediment on freshwater, marine, and estuarine aquatic
life. EPA used this information to develop the criteria proposed today, which represent EPA's first effort to develop
sediment quality criteria. These five chemicals were selected because of their known toxicity, hydrophobicity,
and persistence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA developed these proposed sediment quality criteria using a methodology called the Equilibrium Partitioning
Approach which was selected after considering a variety of approaches that could be used to assess sediment contamination.
Technical reviews of the methodology and supporting science was conducted by the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB)
in February 1989 and June 1992. Data collected in support of the ambient aquatic life water quality criteria or an equivalent
data base were also used to derive the proposed sediment quality criteria. Sediment criteria concentrations are
expressed as micrograms chemical per gram organic carbon and apply to sediments with " 0.2% organic carbon; below
this the criteria should not be applied because of significant scientific uncertainty associated with extrapolating
to sediments with &lt; 0.2% organic carbon.

III. Possible Uses of Sediment Quality Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The main purpose of this notice is to seek comment on the scientific and technical merit of the criteria and methodology.
To place the criteria in context, this section discusses potential uses of the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is in the process of identifying and evaluating a range of possible uses to which final sediment quality criteria
may be applied. For example, EPA is considering whether to use these criteria as a basis for water quality assessment
reports under section 305(b), as a basis for total maximum daily loads under section 303(d), and water quality-based
effluent limits in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (``NPDES'') permits under section 402, and/or
as a possible standard in developing clean-up strategies under the Clean Water Act or other statutes. These and other
possible uses are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305(b) requires the states to assess the quality of their navigable waters in terms of the extent to which they
meet the goals of the Clean Water Act. EPA proposes to encourage states, during these assessments, to identify areas
with sediment contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 303(c), states adopt water quality standards including criteria to protect designated uses. Final
section 304(a) numeric sediment quality criteria guidance could be used by states in adopting State numeric sediment
quality criteria designed to protect the public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water, and serve the purposes
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sediment quality criteria could become a basis for total maximum daily loads under section 303(d) and water quality-based
effluent limits in NPDES permits under section 402. (Their use in NPDES permits is discussed in detail below). Pursuant
to section 303(d), states are required to identify and establish total maximum daily loads for water where existing
pollution controls are not stringent enough to achieve applicable water quality standards. Under section 301(b)(1)(c),
permit writers are required to impose in NPDES permits any more stringent limitations necessary to achieve water
quality standards. If a state has adopted water quality standards based on sediment quality criteria, and if those
standards are not being achieved, then TMDLs are required (unless existing controls will remedy the impairment)
and appropriate effluent limits need to be included in NPDES permits. In addition, even if the states do not adopt numeric
sediment criteria as part of state water quality standards, the EPA section 304(a) criteria could still be used by
State and Federal permit writers as a starting point under 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1)(vi) to derive numeric water quality-based
effluent limits as necessary to attain applicable narrative criteria (e.g., those that require receiving waters
to be ``free from'' toxics). Indeed, many states, as part of their narrative criteria, have adopted prohibitions
against objectionable sediment deposits. Similarly, the section 304(a) criteria could be used in state's TMDLs.

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In EPA's 1987 report, An Overview of Sediment Quality in the United States, municipal sewage treatment plants and
combined sewer overflows were cited as sources of sediment contamination in all regions of the country. Chemical,
steel, metal working and electroplating industries were also mentioned as sources in many areas as were engine and
automotive facilities, nuclear energy producers, paper mills, tanneries, refineries and other petroleum industries,
electrical component and capacitor manufacturers, and wood preservers. The Agency is compiling a national inventory
of point and nonpoint sources of sediment contamination to assist in targeting at risk sites and facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of the role of contaminated sediments as a cause of impaired water quality, the NPDES permitting program
is developing and field testing models predictive of the ambient quality of water and sediment. While existing water
quality models may be quite helpful in understanding the sediment dynamics in specific waterbodies, they may be too
complex to be routinely used by regulatory authorities to establish water quality-based effluent limits based on
sediment quality criteria. The NPDES program is supporting development of a chemical-specific sediment quality
criteria-based effluent limit methdology and is testing its application. The NPDES program also intends to develop
guidance on the procedure. EPA hopes that such a method will be sufficiently sophisticated to be reliable and defensible,
yet require minimal data points and scientific extrapolations so that it can be routinely applied in a regulatory
context. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to developing a sediment quality criteria-based permitting methodology, the NPDES program is supporting
laboratory training, demonstrations, and guidance development on the assessment and control of bioconcentrating
pollutants which, by nature, accumulate in sediments. It is also supporting development of acute and chronic sediment
toxicity tests and sediment toxicity identification evaluations. The sediment quality criteria will advance all
of these efforts by establishing a new tool for achieving the long-term goals of the Act.

Great Lakes Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sediment quality criteria could also be used in connection with the Great Lakes program. For example, the Great Lakes
Water Quality Agreement provides that the United States and Canadian governments will cooperate with State and Provincial
governments to ensure that Remedial Action Plans (``RAPs'') are developed and implemented for specific Areas of
Concern (``AOCs'') in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Water Agreement also calls for the establishment of compatible
criteria between the two countries for the classification of sediment quality. Thus, EPA anticipates that Great
Lake States and EPA Regions will use final sediment quality criteria for various purposes, including establishing
priorities for sites needing further assessment, targeting areas for potential remediation and prevention efforts,
and supporting the development of state water quality standards based on sediment quality criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In each of the designated AOC's located in the United States contaminated sediments have been identified as causing
at least one of the 14 beneficial use impairments listed in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The RAPs are to
specify the beneficial uses that are impaired, the remedial measures needed to restore beneficial uses, and an implementation
schedule. For those AOC's already identified most of the Stage 1 RAPs (problem identification) have already been
completed and most Stage 2 RAPs (remedial actions) are in preparation, therefore, the proposed criteria will be most
applicable for the identification of future AOC's and development of their Stage 1 and 2 RAPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The International Joint Commission (IJC) has published ``listing/delisting criteria'' for adding and removing
a site from the AOC list. The listing/delisting criteria refer to various tools to measure the impacts on beneficial
uses, including the contaminant levels in fish and wildlife, numerical water quality criteria for surface waters,
and, in the case of restrictions on dredging activities, the extent to which sediment contamination may exceed standards,
guidelines, or IJC objectives. The EPA will look to the Great Lakes States to review sediment quality data for each
AOC in relation to the possible impairment of beneficial uses and to consider 304(a) sediment quality criteria and
any other more recent data or relevant site specific data to design preventive and remedial actions for contaminated
sediment. For example, EPA in cooperation with Great Lakes States and the Canadian Federal and Provincial Governments,
may use the sediment quality criteria as one means to prioritize sites for action by comparing the toxic contaminant
concentration in the sediments to the most stringent of either Canadian or U.S. standards or guidelines.

Superfund Program Uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SQC have been developed primarily to assist in pollution prevention and water quality control activities. Due
to many factors, such as the potential for causing environmental damage through distrubing contaminated sediments,
they are not intended as mandatory levels to be met in clean-up efforts. EPA recognizes that, in particular circumstances,
it may be appropriate to use natural recovery as a sediment remediation tool. Superfund is primarily a remediation
program concerned with the clean-up or remediation of sites that have been contaminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Superfund program expects to use SQC as a tool to evaluate sites that may require assessment and possible remediation.
For example, if a site has been shown to exceed SQC levels, it may be given higher priority for assessment with the Hazard
Ranking System (HRS) to help determine if the site should be added to the National Priorities List (NPL). NPL sites
typically require long term remediation efforts. In general, the Superfund program expects to employ SQC for sites
with sediment contamination as part of a tiered testing protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the above approach to the assessment of contaminated sediments, Superfund's approach is consistent with the
conclusions of both the Science Advisory Board's November 1992 review of the criteria and the Agency: ``The use of
SQC's as stand-alone, pass-fail criteria is not recommended for all applications.'' and ``*&blank;*&blank;* the
inappropriate uses of the SQC's, such as mandatory target clean-up standards, [should be stated] unless additional
site specific studies are completed.'' At the same time, SQC's might be considered water quality criteria as referenced
in section 121(d)(2)(A) of CERCLA, and thus potential Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARAR's).
Similarly, if SQC are adopted by States as part of water quality standards, they could be considered as ARARs. The Agency
requests comment on the appropriateness of the use of SQC as ARARs and if so what aspects of the remedial action they
should affect.

RCRA Corrective Action

The Office of Solid Waste will include the 304(a) sediment quality criteria as assessment tools in RCRA Facility Investigations
(RFI's) guidance. Currently the guidance warns about potential sediment quality problems but does not recommend
specific tests to evaluate the ecological and human health risks posed by contaminated sediments.

Other Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A variety of other regulatory and nonregulatory programs are looking to sediment quality criteria as a benchmark
for contaminated sediment evaluations. The dredging program (Sec. 404 of the CWA and 102 of MPRSA), which is jointly
implemented by the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA, may incorporate sediment quality criteria into Tier II of the
dredged material management plan which is currently under development. Other examples of potential sediment quality
criteria uses are to: (1) Proactively monitor to ensure uncontaminated sediments remain uncontaminated; (2) predict
the need to arrest increasing contamination before harm occurs; (3) establish the spatial extent of contamination
to determine the potential costs/benefits of clean-up and remediation efforts; and/or (4) identify sources of contamination
via toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) protocols that link toxic contaminants to sources. In some cases,
sediment criteria alone would be sufficient to identify and to establish goals for remediation or clean-up of contaminated
sediment. In other cases the sediment criteria should be supplemented with biological sampling and testing and more
extensive chemical monitoring before decisions are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the Science Advisory Board nor the Agency believes the sediment quality criteria should be used as ``pass/fail''
criteria or mandatory clean-up levels for all programs. It is often more environmentally sound to allow clean sediments
to cover contaminated sediments over time than to remove the sediments in question. The removal of contaminated sediments
may in and of itself cause physical harm to bottom communities as well as cause resuspension and dispersion of the contaminant
being removed. The costs of clean-up may also be prohibitive because of the level or areal extent of contamination
and the disposal requirements for contaminated sediments. Therefore, EPA expects that the sediment quality criteria
will be used in a tiered approach to evaluate the level and areal extent of sediment contamination and the risk associated
with a variety of clean-up or remediation alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In combination, the above authorities provide a comprehensive mechanism for monitoring, assessing and researching
the effects of pollutants on the Nation's waters and regulating the discharges in order to eliminate or limit their
potential impacts on water quality. EPA also expects to publish, in the near future, an EPA Contaminated Sediment
Management Strategy, which will provide guidance on the application of the sediment quality criteria. Though not
specifically requested at this time, comments received in connection with this notice that discuss implementation
issues will be considered in the development of the draft strategy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is soliciting comments on the scientific soundness of the criteria development methodology and the proposed
criteria themselves. The sediment quality criteria, like the surface water quality criteria, are ambient criteria
describing aquatic conditions which support designated uses. The merit and validity of these criteria must stand
alone without regard to permit limit derivation, sediment remediation costs, etc. Specifically the Agency requests
comment on the five sediment quality criteria documents described above, the document entitled ``Technical Basis
for Deriving Sediment Quality Criteria for Nonionic Organic Contaminants for the Protection of Benthic Organisms
by Using Equilibrium Partitioning'' and the ``Guidelines for Deriving Site-Specific Sediment Quality Criteria
for the Protection of Benthic Organisms''. EPA is also interested in receiving comments on the following issues:

1. Site Specific Criteria Modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 304(a) a state may develop its own water quality criteria on either a state-wide basis or on a site-specific
basis to be protective of unique waters. EPA is considering the same approach for the developement of sediment quality
criteria. Section 131.11(b)(1) of EPA's regulations allows states to modify 304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific
conditions, when adopting water quality standards based on such criteria guidance and EPA is considering allowing
similar site-specific modification for water quality standards based on EPA's sediment quality criteria guidance.
Technical persons have identified a number of reasons both supporting and challenging the appropriateness of allowing
site specific modifications to sediment criteria. EPA is particularly interested in receiving comments and ideas
on site specific criteria modifications. A more detailed discussion of these issues can be found on this topic on page
99 of the Technical Basis document identified above.

2. Need for Separate Sediment Quality Criteria To Protect Fresh Water and Marine Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For certain chemicals (acenaphthene, dieldrin, fluoranthene, and phenanthrene), statistical analysis of all
the data used in the derivation of water quality criteria revealed no significant differences in the relative sensitivity
of fresh water and marine species. Further, there are no known chemical or physical properties of the above chemicals
that would support a difference in toxicity and bioavailability between aquatic environments. (These comparisons
do not hold for endrin.) However, EPA customarily has developed separate criteria for saltwater and freshwater to
avoid having the sensitivity of species in one aquatic environment drive environmental decisions and regulation
in the other environment. Although these sediment quality criteria are derived separately for freshwater and saltwater,
EPA seeks comment on the appropriateness of a single sediment quality criteria applicable to both aquatic environments
after first demonstrating equivalency of sensitivity (for these and future criteria).

3. Level of Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing section 304(a) criteria are intended to protect a balanced and indigenous aquatic community by protecting
most individuals within sensitive species. As a practical matter, the basic aquatic life procedure approximates
the goal by deriving criteria to protect most individuals in the 95th percentile (most sensitive) of the tested genera.
This is done by basing acute criteria on LC50 or similar tests, and dividing the final result by two to protect most individuals,
as opposed to protecting only 50%. Less sensitive species are more fully protected, while more sensitive species
are somewhat protected. There are exceptions procedures which override this basic approach where necessary to protect
wildlife, plants, or commercially important aquatic species. See 50 FR 30784, July 29, 1985, for details. Tested
species are selected to include a minimum data set of specified aquatic species. As such, tested species are considered
to be surrogates for untested species. This same approach is currently proposed for benthic organisms via the sediment
quality criteria. Comment is being sought on the appropriateness of this approach.

4. Use of SQC as ARAR's in the CERCLA Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of sediment quality criteria for adoption by States into State water quality standards provides
for the potential requirement in those States that the SQC be used as ARAR's. As discussed earlier, EPA is concerned
that this ``mandatory clean-up level'' may be an inappropriate use of the proposed criteria. The Agency requests
comment on the use of SQC as ARAR's should they be adopted into State water quality standards.

5. Definition of Sediments to Which Sediment Quality Criteria Apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria documents define sediments to which SQC are applicable as those ``permanently inundated with water,
intertidal sediment and to sediments inundated periodically for durations sufficient to permit development of
benthic assemblages.'' The criteria are not intended to apply to ``sediments occasionally inundated so that they
support terrestrial species.'' The Agency believes the appropriate uses of SQC are for those sediments that maintain,
or have the potential to maintain if not contaminated, benthic aquatic assemblages. Comments that discuss a broader
or narrower definition or that support the proposed definition are requested.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the core items of President Clinton's economic proposals is the need to empower America's distressed rural
and urban communities. His Empowerment Zone proposal represents a new approach to the problems of distressed communities.
It emphasizes a bottom-up community based strategy rather than the traditional top-down bureaucratic approach.
It is a strategy to address economic, human, community, and physical development problems and opportunities in a
comprehensive fashion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted to implement the President's vision, authorizes the
Secretary of Department of Agriculture to designate up to three Empowerment Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities
in rural areas. (Unless otherwise noted, all references in this Notice to Empowerment Zones also include Enterprise
Communities.) This Notice invites applications from State and local governments, regional planning agencies,
non-profit organizations, community-based organizations, or other locally-based organizations for the Secretarial
designations as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program is intended to combine the resources of the Federal Government with those of State and local governments,
educational institutions and the private and non-profit sectors to implement community-developed strategic plans
for economic development. The Federal Government has taken steps to coordinate Federal assistance in support of
the Zones, including expedited processing, priority funding, and waiver of regulations. To that end, President
Clinton has issued an Executive Order that creates a Community Enterprise Board chaired by Vice President Al Gore
to ensure the success of the Empowerment Zone initiative.

II. Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute specifies certain criteria that must apply in order for an area to be eligible for Empowerment Zone designation,
including geographic size, population, poverty rate by census tract (or by block numbering areas when the community
is not delineated by census tracts), pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress of the area. The details
of these requirements are described in the interim rule governing the program published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information must be provided in the application. USDA will accept certifications of the data by the State and
local governments, subject to further verification of the data prior to designation as a Zone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Designation Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute specifies three factors to be considered by the Secretary in designating Empowerment Zones: (1) The effectiveness
of the Strategic Plan; (2) the effectiveness of the assurances provided in support of the Strategic Plan; and (3) other
criteria to be specified by the Secretary. Each of these factors is discussed in greater detail in the interim rule
(The Strategic Plan is described in the interim rule at 7 CFR 25.200(c)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications may be obtained from any FmHA State Office and from Rural EZ/EC State Contacts (see Appendix A) or by sending
an Internet Mail message to: info@ezec.usda.gov. An application may be submitted 30 days from the date of publication
of the interim rule, which governs the Empowerment Zone program. The deadline for receipt of the application will
be 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time, Thursday, June 30, 1994. Applications received after that date and time will
not be accepted, and will be returned to the sender. As the applications require certifications from the State and
local governments, we cannot accept applications sent by FAX or through the Internet system. The original application
and one (1) copy should be sent to: US Department of Agriculture, Rural Development Administration, EZ/EC Team, room
5405, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3200.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Notice of Intent to Apply
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants should fill out and mail a Notice of Intent to Apply. The form of notice is located at the end of the Empowerment
Zone Application (see Appendix B), or may be obtained by sending an Internet Mail message to: info@ezec.usda.gov
to obtain the notice. Applicants may wish to submit the form in order to be placed on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise
Community mailing list. While the notice is not mandatory for participation in the program, USDA encourages the submission
of the notice as it will permit the Department to provide applicants with updated information on program requirements
as well as information on technical assistance.

VI. Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Empowerment Zone designation does not constitute a Federal action for provisions of the Uniform Relocation Act.
However, any activity constituting a Federal action that may result from such a designation may be subject to the provision
of this Act, as well as any other statutory or regulatory provisions governing the particular Federal action.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the core of President Clinton's economic proposals to Congress and to the American people is the need to empower
America's distressed communities. His Empowerment Zone proposal represents a new approach to the problems of distressed
communities. It uses a bottom-up community based strategy rather than a top-down bureaucratic approach. It is a strategy
to empower residents and all sections of a community to come together to create jobs and opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted to implement the President's vision, authorizes the
Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to designate up to six Empowerment Zones and up to 65 Enterprise
Communities in urban areas and the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to designate up to three Empowerment
Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities in rural areas. (Unless otherwise noted, all references in this Notice to
Empowerment Zones also include Enterprise Communities.) This Notice invites applications from State and local
governments for the purpose of nominating urban areas to be designated as Empowerment Zones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program is intended to combine the resources of the Federal government with those of State and local governments,
educational institutions, and the private and non-profit sectors to implement the Strategic Plan. The Federal government
will take steps to coordinate Federal assistance in support of the Zones, including expedited processing, priority
funding, and working to overcome programmatic regulatory and statutory impediments. To that end, a Presidential
Directive has been issued that creates a Community Enterprise Board headed by Vice President Gore to carry out these
responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute specifies certain criteria that must apply in order for an area to be eligible for Empowerment Zone designation,
including geographic size, population, poverty rate by census tract (or where an area is not tracted, generally in
rural areas, by the equivalent of census tracts_block numbering areas), pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general
distress of the area. The details of these requirements are described in the interim rule governing the program, published
elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information must be provided in the application. HUD will accept certifications of the data, subject to verification
if an application is selected for designation.

III. Designation Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute specifies three factors to be considered by the Secretary in designating Empowerment Zones: (1) The effectiveness
of the Strategic Plan; (2) the effectiveness of the assurances provided in support of the Plan; and (3) other criteria
to be specified by the Secretary. Each of these factors is discussed in greater detail in the interim rule. (The Strategic
Plan is described in the interim rule at 24 CFR 597.200.)

Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2), notice is hereby given that the
Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Executive Panel Intelligence Update will meet January 18, 1994, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at
the Center for Naval Analyses.  This session will be closed to the public.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this meeting is to provide an update of significant foreign intelligence developments which will affect
future Navy planning.  The agenda will consist of a series of sensitive all source briefings by the Office of Naval Intelligence
with questions and discussion of subject matter following each briefing.  These matters constitute classified information
that is specifically authorized by Executive order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to be kept secret in the interest of national defense and are,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 in fact, properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.  Accordingly, the Secretary of the Navy has determined
in writing that the public interest requires that all sessions of the meeting be closed to the public because they will
be concerned with matters listed in section 552b(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code.
