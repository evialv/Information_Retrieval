SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule broadens the current regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in the Food Distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Distribution Program for Indian Households in Oklahoma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FDPIHO). First, this change mandates that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households which pass the program means test, reside in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated areas near a reservation where an Indian Tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organization (ITO) or State agency provides program services, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include a Native American be eligible to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's tribal affiliation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age. Secondly, it also makes such households which lack a Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American adult, but which include Native American children, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible to participate in the FDPIHO. Finally, this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies that all households which pass the program means test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and live on a reservation where an ITO or State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administers the FDPIR, are eligible to receive benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether they contain a Native American.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Effective Date 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section of the preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of the provisions,
all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. This includes any administrative procedures provided
by state or local governments. For disputes involving procurements by State agencies or Indian Tribal Organizations,
this includes any administrative appeal procedures to the extent required by 7 CFR 253.5(l), 7 CFR 254.3(a), and 7
CFR part 3016. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule published on October 20, 1987 (52 FR 39158), proposed to authorize ITOs and State agencies to serve income-eligible
households residing in near areas which contain an Indian tribal member, regardless of that person's tribal affiliation.
This interim rule will mandate that all such households be provided program benefits upon application. Because the
Department believes that permitting ITOs and State agencies to exclude these Native Americans from program participation
simply because they do not live on a reservation or near their tribe's reservation is inequitable and counter to the
intent of FDPIR, the Administrator of FNS has determined that prior notice and comment on this provision of this rule
would be unnecessary and contrary to public interest. For this reason, the Administrator has determined, in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), that good cause exists to waive the solicitation of public comments prior to implementation.
However, the Department believes this rule may be improved by public comment based on actual operating experience.
Therefore, comments solicited on this rule must be postmarked or submitted on or before March 14, 1994. All comments
will be analyzed, and any appropriate changes to the rule will be incorporated in the subsequent publication of a final
rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) was established by section 4(b) of the Food Stamp Act
of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2013(b)), as an alternative to food stamps for low-income Native Americans who, because
they live on or near Indian reservations in sparsely populated areas, may not have convenient access to food stamp
certification offices or authorized food stamp retailers. However, the current regulatory definition of ``Indian
tribal household'' at 7 CFR 253.2(c) and 254.2(d) renders ineligible certain categories of such Native Americans.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first category is comprised of households which lack a Native American adult, but which include Native American
children. Although such households do not exist in large numbers, they reside in many of the areas adjacent to reservations
(i.e., ``near areas'') which Indian Tribal Organizations or State agencies have chosen to serve. Native American
children may be part of a household that lacks a Native American adult due, for example, to death of a parent or divorce.
Also, Native American children may be living with non-Native American foster or adoptive parents. These children
are not necessarily in any less need of the program than children living with Native American adults in near areas,
who may participate. The definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in the FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) requires that all
households residing in a near area have an adult Indian tribal member in order to participate. The definition in the
FDPIHO at 7 CFR 254.2(d) also requires that all households have an adult Indian member in order to participate. Thus,
Native American children in otherwise eligible households are denied access to both of these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second category excluded from participating applies only to FDPIR: Native American households, residing in
near areas, which lack a member of a tribe that is represented by the ITO or State agency administering the program on
the adjacent reservation. The definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR 253.2(c) excludes such households,
in effect, due to the combination of their tribal affiliation and where they reside. They could be eligible if they
lived on the reservation in question, or on or near the reservation of the tribe of which they are a member. The Department
believes that exclusion of these Native Americans from program participation simply because they do not live on a
reservation or near their tribe's reservation, is inequitable and counter to the intent of FDPIR. Their Native American
identity and potential need for the program are in no way diminished by their current residence. In contrast, Native
American tribal households residing in any program service area in Oklahoma may participate in FDPIHO regardless
of their tribal affiliation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;253.2(e) of the proposed rule published on October 20, 1987 (52 FR 39158), the Department proposed to amend
the FDPIR definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to give ITOs and State agencies the option to serve a household
which lacks a member of a tribe they represent, but which includes a member of another recognized Indian tribe. All
16 comments received on this proposed change supported it. During its 1992 annual meeting, the National Association
of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations (NAFDPIR) also supported the proposal. In resolution 92&hyph;7,
NAFDPIR supported the broadening of the current definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to include ``any household
in which at least one household member is recognized as an Indian.'' NAFDPIR believes that all Native Americans in
near areas should be eligible to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation as has always been the case in
FDPIHO service areas. The language in the proposed rule addressing this issue is therefore implemented in this interim
rule with two clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in &sect;253.2(c) is revised by changing ``recognized by the
appropriate ITO as a tribal member'' to ``recognized as a tribal member by any Indian tribe as defined in this part.''
This change in definition would make those households containing a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in Section
253.2(d) eligible to apply for FDPIR without regard to whether the person is a member of a tribe represented by the ITO
or State agency administering the program in the near area. Thus, based on the definition of ``Indian tribe,'' any
household containing a person belonging to any Indian tribe, band, or other organized Indian group on a reservation
which is recognized as eligible for Federal programs and services provided to Indians, or which holds a treaty with
a State government, would be eligible to receive FDPIR benefits if he/she also meets the income eligibility requirements.
This same amendment is made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in &sect;254.2(d) of the FDPIHO regulations.
However, in the FDPIHO, income-eligible Native American households residing in any program service area in the State
have always been permitted to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation. Therefore, this amendment as
applied to FDPIHO constitutes a clarification only and not, as in the case of the FDPIR, a substantive change which
affects program eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, &sect;253.6(b)(1) is changed to clarify that all households which pass the program means test, reside in
near areas and include a Native American must be allowed to participate in the FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's
specific tribal affiliation. Thus, if a household member can obtain documentation from his/her tribe of origin that
he/she is recognized as a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in &sect;253.2(d), the ITO or State agency administering
the program in the near area must accept that recognition for purposes of program eligibility. The ITO or State agency
itself has no discretion to decide which tribes it will recognize in the near area. It should be pointed out that the
ITO or State agency also has no discretion to decide issues of tribal membership since each Indian tribe has always
been responsible for defining its own members. Thus, for eligibility purposes, the ITO or State agency simply makes
a determination as to whether or not an applicant household has official documentation of membership from its tribe
of origin. If the tribe of origin is an ``Indian tribe,'' as defined in &sect;253.2(d), the ITO or State agency must
serve the household as long as it meets all other FDPIR eligibility requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 20, 1987, proposed rule did not clearly propose to mandate that all households with Indian tribal members
be eligible for program benefits in near areas. Rather, its thrust was to remove a regulatory barrier to participation
of such households. Thus the language authorized ITOs and State agencies to serve such households. Upon further consideration
of the issue, the Department has concluded that ITOs or State agencies themselves should not be in a position to impose
barriers to participation based on the tribal affiliation of a member of a household residing in a near area. Therefore,
this interim rule mandates that such households be served under the program if they are determined income-eligible,
rather than permitting the administering agency to serve them at its discretion. Given the shift from allowing such
households to be served in the proposed rule to mandating that they be served, the Department is publishing this rule
as an interim regulation with provision for public comment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current FDPIR regulations do not clearly state that non-Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American households living on the reservation who meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program means test are eligible to receive program benefits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although this has always been the policy under which FDPIR has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated on all participating reservations. While the 1987 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule did not specifically address this issue, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule does so in order to formalize and clarify what has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always been household eligibility policy and practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, &sect;253.6(b)(1) is revised to clarify that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households living on the reservation, and meeting the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means test, are eligible to receive program benefits, even if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they do not contain a Native American. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1987 proposed rule did not specifically propose to remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDPIR requirement that households living in a near area must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an adult Native American in order to be eligible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in FDPIR. However, in the preamble, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that this suggestion had been made, summarized the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason for such a change, and solicited comments to determine how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive this problem is and whether others believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the definition is necessary. Nineteen of the 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received in response to this solicitation supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of the requirement. Accordingly, the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Indian tribal household'' in FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule reads as follows: ``a household in which at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one household member is recognized as a tribal member by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indian tribe, as defined in this part.'' This same amendment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
254.2(d). Since the requirement that the household include an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adult Native American in order to be eligible also exists in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDPIHO, the change will have the same remedial effect in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 906, as amended (7 CFR part 906), regulating
the handling of oranges and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the
order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 15 citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges and grapefruit
grown in Texas, and about 750 producers of oranges and grapefruit in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been
defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee, which administers the order locally, meets prior to and during each season to review the handling regulations
effective on a continuous basis for each citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the
public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations,
information submitted by the committee and other information, to determine whether modification, suspension,
or termination of the handling regulation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on October 18, 1993, with an effective date of October 25, 1993, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 54925, October 25, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending November 24, 1993,
and no comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4) of &sect;906.365 by temporarily relaxing the minimum size requirement
to permit shipment of grapefruit measuring at least 35/16 inches in diameter (pack size 112) for the entire 1993&hyph;94
season ending July 31, 1994, provided such grapefruit grade at least U.S. No. 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This relaxation is expected to help the Texas citrus industry successfully market its 1993&hyph;94 season grapefruit
crop and have a positive effect on producer returns. Permitting shipment of pack size 112 grapefruit grading at least
U.S. No. 1 for the entire 1993&hyph;94 season will enable Texas grapefruit handlers to meet market needs and compete
with similar sized grapefruit expected to be shipped from Florida. This action is based on the current and prospective
crop and market conditions for Texas grapefruit. Fresh Texas grapefruit shipments began in mid-September this season.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule also removed paragraph (c) of &sect;906.365. That paragraph set forth quality requirements
for oranges and grapefruit which were in effect through February 15, 1992. Thus, the provisions in that paragraph
were obsolete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas grapefruit shipments to fresh markets in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are subject to handling requirements
effective under this order. Exempt from such handling requirements are shipments made: (1) Within the production
area in Texas; (2) in individually addressed gift packages aggregating not more than 500 pounds which are not for resale;
(3) under the 400 pound minimum quantity exemption provision; and (4) for relief, charity, and home use. In addition,
fruit shipped to approved processors located outside of the production area may be exempted from the handling requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the relaxed requirements
set forth in the interim final rule. The Department believes that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers
and handlers because it will permit 1993&hyph;94 season grapefruit shipments consistent with anticipated crop
and market conditions. The application of handling requirements to Texas grapefruit over the years has been beneficial
to the Texas citrus industry in marketing its crops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the relaxation set forth below will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act.

 This rule finalizes without change an interim final rule which revised the handling requirements for Texas oranges
and grapefruit to require handlers to ensure that an inspection certificate accompanies each shipment of fruit when
it is transported by motor vehicle, and that such inspection certificates are surrendered upon leaving the production
area when requested by Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) road guard station personnel designated as agents of
the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee). This revision was designed to help the Texas citrus industry ensure
that all fresh oranges and grapefruit are inspected prior to shipment from the production area.

requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 15 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 750 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the
Small Business Administration [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and
small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee met on August 3, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;906.365 to require
handlers to ensure that an inspection certificate accompanies each shipment of fruit when it is transported by motor
vehicle, and that such inspection certificates are surrendered upon leaving the production area when requested
by Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) road guard station personnel designated as agents of the committee. The
committee meets prior to and during each season to review the handling regulations effective on a continuous basis
for fruit regulated under the marketing order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons
may express their views at these meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended this action after discussions with TDA road guard station personnel on the subject of operating
road guard stations located on the major roads leading out of the production area for Texas oranges and grapefruit.
TDA informed the committee that, heretofore, TDA road guard station personnel had not been authorized to require
handlers to surrender a copy of their inspection certificates to them, when checking fruit being transported from
the production area to determine if it had been inspected and certified as meeting order requirements. Requiring
handlers to surrender a copy of their inspection certificates to the TDA will enable TDA personnel to determine whether
the fruit meets order requirements, thereby helping ensure compliance with order provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, to
determine whether modification, suspension, or termination of the handling regulation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on October 4, 1993, with an effective date of October 8, 1993, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 52400, October 8, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-comment period ending November 8, 1993, and no
comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule amended &sect;906.365 by adding the following sentence at the end of paragraph (a)(5). ``No
handler may transport by motor vehicle or cause the transportation of any shipment of fruit for which an inspection
certificate is required unless each such shipment is accompanied by a copy of the inspection certificate applicable
thereto, and a copy of such inspection certificate is surrendered upon request to Texas Department of Agriculture
Road Guard personnel as designated by the committee.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revision of handling
requirements set forth in the interim final rule. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial
impact on producers and handlers, since it will authorize TDA road guard station personnel to require surrender of
inspection certificates upon leaving the production area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

 This interim final rule amends a previous interim final rule which authorized administrative expenses for the South
Texas Onion Committee (Committee) under M.O. No. 959. This interim final rule increases the level of authorized expenses
and establishes an increased assessment rate to generate funds to pay those expenses. Authorization of this increased
budget enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds
to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 143 and Order No. 959, both as amended (7 CFR part 959), regulating
the handling of onions grown in South Texas. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, South Texas onions are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable onions handled during the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period,
which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 47 producers of South Texas onions under this marketing order, and approximately 34 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $3,500,000. The majority of South Texas onion producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period was prepared by the South Texas Onion Committee, the agency
responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculture for
approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of South Texas onions. They are familiar with the
Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate
an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons
have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of South Texas onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 for personnel, office, and compliance expenses were recommended
in a mail vote completed August 4, 1993. The assessment rate and funding for the research and promotion projects were
to be recommended at a later Committee meeting. The Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 were published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an interim final rule September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50509). That interim final rule added &sect;959.234, authorizing
expenses for the Committee, and provided that interested persons could file comments through October 28, 1993. No
comments were filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee subsequently met on November 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended increases of $2,500 for personnel
expenses and $125,000 for compliance activities in the recently approved 1993&hyph;94 budget. The compliance increase
will provide for funds to operate road guard stations surrounding the production area. The Committee also unanimously
recommended $210,000 in market development activities and $105,600 in production research. These expenditures
represent increases over last year's budget of $65,000 for market development and $11,412 for production research.
Under this amended budget, expense items for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period are as follows: $37,472 for personnel,
$29,028 for office expenses, $141,000 for compliance activities, $210,000 for market development, and $105,600
for production research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial 1994 budget, published on September 28, 1993, did not establish an assessment rate. Therefore, the Committee
also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per 50-pound container or equivalent of onions, $0.03 more
than last year's assessment rate. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of approximately 5 million 50-pound
containers or equivalents, will yield $500,000 in assessment income, which, along with $23,100 from the reserve,
will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve as of September 30, 1993, were $346,415, which is
within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period began on August 1, 1993, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to that taken for the 1992&hyph;93
fiscal period; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received
will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 966 and 984 for
the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Florida Tomato Committee and the Walnut
Marketing Board (Committee and Board) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the programs.
Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 125 and Order No. 966, both as amended (7 CFR part 966), regulating
the handling of tomatoes grown in Florida; and Marketing Agreement and Order No. 984, both as amended (7 CFR part 984),
regulating the handling of walnuts grown in California. The marketing agreements and orders are effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Florida tomatoes and California walnuts are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal period, which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 250 producers of Florida tomatoes under Marketing Order 966, and approximately 50 handlers.
Also, there are approximately 5,000 producers of California walnuts under Marketing Order 984, and approximately
65 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may
be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budgets of expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period were prepared by the Committee and the Board, the agencies
responsible for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Florida Tomato Committee are producers. The members of the California Walnut Board are producers
and handlers. They are familiar with the Committee's and Board's needs and with the costs for goods and services in
their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed
in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input
into these processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee and Board expenses by expected
respective shipments of Florida tomatoes and merchantable California walnuts. Because these rates will be applied
to actual shipments of tomatoes and of certified merchantable walnuts, the assessment rates must be established
at levels that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's and Board's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Tomato Committee met September 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $2,682,000,
which is $4,000 less than the previous year. Increases in expenditures, which include $6,250 for office rent, $200
for miscellaneous, and $4,000 for research expense, will be offset by decreases of $7,000 for office salaries and
$7,450 for employees' retirement program. Major expense items include $276,000 for office salaries, $200,000 for
research expense, and $2,000,000 for education and promotion expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.04 per 25-pound container, the same as last year.
This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 58,000,000 25-pound containers, will yield $2,320,000 in assessment
income. This, along with $20,000 in interest and other income and $342,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve,
will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve at the beginning of the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal period were $1,349,348, which is within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Walnut Marketing Board met September 10, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $1,941,647,
$69,551 more than the previous year. Increases include $4,511 for administrative salaries, $171 for general insurance,
$200 for audit, $7,649 for group life, retirement, and medical plan, $835 for office salaries, $7,904 for office rent,
$6,000 for office supplies and miscellaneous, $1,000 for telephone and FAX, $2,000 for equipment maintenance and
warranties, $9,000 for furniture, fixtures, and automobiles, $7,450 for production research director, and the
addition of a $43,000 acreage survey category. These increases will be partially offset by decreases of $300 for social
security and hospital insurance taxes, $5,000 for domestic market research and development, and $14,869 for production
research. Major expenses include $101,331 for administrative salaries, $40,771 for office salaries, $875,000
for domestic market research and development, $490,488 for production research, $91,068 for production research
director, and $43,000 for a walnut acreage survey. A reserve for contingencies of $50,000 is also included in the 1993&hyph;94
budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.009 per kernelweight pound, $0.001 less than the
previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 2,157,386 kernelweight pounds of merchantable
walnuts, will yield $1,941,647 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Unexpended
funds may be used temporarily during the first five months of the subsequent marketing year, but must be made available
to the handlers from whom collected within that period.

added &sect;966.231 and &sect;984.344 which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committee
and Board. Those rules provided that interested persons could file comments through November 26, 1993, for 7 CFR part
966 and through November 29, 1993, for 7 CFR part 984. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely
to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee and Board need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred
on a continuous basis. The 1993&hyph;94 fiscal periods for the programs began on August 1, 1993. The marketing orders
require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods apply to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during
the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions which were recommended by the Committee and Board
at public meetings and published in the

immigration benefits. This initiative has already led to a number of steps which have begun to significantly improve
efficiency and the quality of service provided to the public.

A number of comments were received about this proposal. Many were prepared by a working group of interested organizations.
The following sections discuss the comments and explain the revisions adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters opposed the proposed requirement that an applicant or petitioner sing Form G&hyph;28, Notice
of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, to show that he or she authorized the representation. For example,
one commenter argued that an attorney's indication that he or she represents someone should be accepted as ``absolutely
definitive evidence'' since submission by an attorney where not so authorized would be a violation of his or her ethical
and legal obligations, and would subject him or her to disciplinary action and a malpractice suit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a number of other commenters within the industry supported the new requirement. Some pointed out that the
form is not only used by attorneys. Others noted that requiring the signature can help combat the unauthorized practice
of law. Still others felt that the signature would address potential Privacy Act concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons given by those supporting the new requirement, as well a those enumerated in the proposed rule, this
proposal has been retained. An applicant or petitioner must sign the Form G&hyph;28 to definitively indicate to the
Service that he or she has authorized the person to represent him or her in the proceeding. The person submitting the
Form G&hyph;28 must be authorized under 8 CFR part 292 to represent the applicant or petitioner. Where a Form G&hyph;28
is submitted that is not properly signed, the application or petition will be processed as if a Form G&hyph;28 had not
been submitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where an applicant or petitioner has an authorized representative, the Service now mails two copies of each written
notice. One goes to the applicant or petitioner, and the other goes to the authorized representative. The proposed
rule suggested sending only one notice in such a case, and sending it to the representative. This would have meant that
the Service would communicate with the applicant or petitioner through his or her authorized representative if he
or she had one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters pointed to past problems in representatives receiving their copy, and argued that separate notices
should be continued as a safeguard. After review, the Service will therefore continue to send separate notices to
the applicant or petitioner and his or her authorized representative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters also asked that the Service begin sending copies of notices to anyone assisting an applicant or
petitioner, and not simply to authorized representatives. However, while the Service cannot limit or control who
can assist others in filling out and filing an application or petition, only a person who meets the criteria in 8 CFR
parts 1 and 292 can act as the applicant or petitioner's authorized representative and submit a Form G&hyph;28. A person
who does not meet these criteria cannot represent the applicant or petitioner, and cannot be notified of any action
taken on the application or petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters opposed the proposed modification of when the Service would send a notice by certified mail. After
review, this proposal has been withdrawn.

Filing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters requested that additional filing instructions be included on forms to eliminate confusion
about where to file. Last year the Service began to include such specific information on the new generation of application
and petition forms. This process will continue as older versions of forms are replaced or eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that application and petition forms be published for public comment since the instructions
have the effect of regulation. All form revisions are carefully reviewed to ensure they are consistent with regulations.
In addition to informally circulating significant changes to forms for comment, the Service intends to begin to publish
form revisions as required and as deemed necessary for effective communications. The Service is committed to revising
forms on a more frequent basis to keep up with ever changing immigration laws and changes in procedures. The Service
wants to assist people in learning about immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and help them understand
what is required to file a complete application. This will facilitate quicker processing and minimize the delays
and additional processing costs associated with requests for more information or evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As suggested by many commenters, language has been added to clarify that a child can file an application or petition
for himself or herself, in addition to allowing a parent or legal guardian to file. Other commenters suggested that
anyone be allowed to file such a petition, pointing to 8 CFR 101.6(b)(1), which permits such a broad group of persons
to file petitions for juveniles dependent on a juvenile court in the United States. However, except for these unique
circumstances, there is no valid reason to allow a person who has no legal authority over a child to assume the right
to act in the child's behalf before the Service. Therefore, this suggestion has not been adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to allow the filing of photocopies of documents with applications and petitions instead of originals
was universally applauded as a significant step in streamlining filing procedures. However, one commenter asked
whether each copy would need to be certified that it is exact and unaltered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence submitted in the context of an application or petition is part of that application or petition. See 8 CFR 270.1.
By signing the application or petition form, the person certifies under penalty of perjury that the application or
petition, and all evidence submitted with it, is true and correct. The rule has been clarified to indicate that a separate
certification for each copy is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the rule be revised so that in cases where an applicant or petitioner submits an original
when he or she could have submitted a copy, the Service would be required to make the copy and return the original.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recognizes that people need to retain original documents for their records. This was one of the primary
reasons why the Service made the decision to accept photocopies. However, the Service processes over 4 million applications
and petitions each year. In cases where a person chooses to submit originals instead of copies, the Service is not in
a position to make the copies for him or her so the originals can be returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provided that where the Service determines a need to review the original of a document, the applicant
or petitioner would have 30 days to submit the original document. Several commenters suggested that 30 days does not
allow enough time, since people might not have the document and would have to get one from the issuing authority. They
suggested a 60 or 90-day period instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The idea of allowing copies was proposed so applicants and petitioners can file a copy and keep the original, not so
they can file a copy because they don't have an original. By filing a copy as part of their application or petition, they
are attesting that the copy is true and correct. This would be problematic if they do not have an original. However,
to minimize confusion and to standardize the various response periods provided in this rule, the final rule provides
12 weeks, without extension, for submission of an original document. If an applicant or petitioner does not submit
the requested original document within that 12-week period, the application or petition will be denied for failure
to provide the original.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the Service begin to accept copies and computer-generated versions of application
and petition forms, and to allow filing by facsimile. The Service will accept photocopies and computer-generated
versions that are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
identical
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to Service forms in all respects, including placement, perforations and fastener holes. We cannot accept facsimiles
because they do not meet these requirements. It is essential that the forms not vary in any way from the original since
the Service is introducing imaging systems and other systems to speed processing that depend on exact form specifications.
The Service is also very interested in electronic filing as a way of speeding processing and reducing costs, and is
researching various technologies that would allow such filing with fee transmittal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Almost every commenter discussed the initial evidence rules, which proposed that an application or petition filed
without the evidence required by the instructions on the application or petition form would be denied, but without
prejudice to the later filing of a complete application or petition. A number of commenters agreed that the proposal
would reduce the percentage of cases in which the Service has to ask for more evidence during the adjudications process,
and thus review twice, and that this would help speed overall processing times. Several commenters noted that the
additional explanations on the new application and petition forms of what evidence is required will help people to
file complete applications and petitions. Others supported threshold standards for filing. However, a number of
commenters had serious reservations about the initial evidence requirements described in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the Service should help applicants and petitioners correct cases that lack the
required initial evidence rather than require them to start over and file again. Others suggested the proposed rule
did not sufficiently recognize that some people may unintentionally fail to file the required initial evidence.
A few suggested that while the Service should deny clearly deficient cases, it should not deny ``marginal'' cases,
but should give those people a chance to correct their cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the Service continue to add evidence explanations to its new forms, but only monitor
the effect and not implement procedures to deny incomplete applications. Another commenter, who opposed the entire
concept of threshold requirements, asserted that allowing the Service to deny an application or petition for lack
of initial evidence would give it ``unbridled'' discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial evidence is the evidence necessary to establish a basis for filing and to allow the Service to process the average
case through to completion the first time. As indicated by many commenters, it is in the best interest of applicants
and petitioners, as well as in the interest of the Service, that an application or petition be complete when first filed
so a decision can be entered quickly and correctly, without delays caused by having to go back and ask an applicant or
petitioner for more evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial evidence explanations included in revised application and petition forms are designed to help people
know what types of basic evidence they should always submit with their application or petition. The explanations
also clarify statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria by translating them into more concrete terms. The question
here is what the Service should do when someone files without the required threshold evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most basic issues in processing an application or petition for an immigration benefit are determining eligibility
for the benefit, and treating all applicants and petitioners fairly and equitably. Among other things, this means
using processing systems that ensure that cases are not processed in a way that enables one applicant or petitioner
to derive an unfair advantage over another applying for the same benefit. For example, this means ensuring that priority
dates for immigration and case processing dates are accorded in ways that do not encourage a person to file an incomplete
application as a means of stepping in line in front of someone else who waits to obtain all the necessary evidence before
filing. It also means establishing processing parameters to minimize instances where the Service has to handle repeatedly
an application because basic documents are missing. This increases average processing time, and raises costs which
are transferred to all applicants through filing fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Service recognizes that these processes must operate in an environment in which a significant number
of applicants and petitioners are unfamiliar with the English language and government requirements. The Service's
goal is to recognize the needs of the population we serve while setting processing parameters that allow the agency
to process applications quickly, correctly and fairly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, most applications were submitted in person at a local Service office. This provided an opportunity to
review the application, and not accept it at that time if it lacked necessary evidence. However, this has led to occasions
where discrepancies in local acceptance standards have been alleged. In order to make filing easier as the volume
of applications has grown, and to make processing more consistent, the Service has moved towards a mail-in process.
Since advance review is not possible in such a situation, there must be clear guidelines for handling cases filed without
necessary evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has revised the initial evidence process as a result of the comments received. In general, the Service
will not deny a case for lack of initial evidence. An application or petition will be reviewed after fee receipting.
If required initial evidence is missing and there is no evidence of ineligibility in the record, the applicant or petitioner
will be notified and given 12 weeks from the date of the notice, without extension, to submit the missing initial evidence.
However, if the application is pre-screened by INS prior to its submission, such as in a situation where the person
files the application in person, and the person insists on filing the application even though necessary initial evidence
is missing, the case shall be denied for lack of required initial evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does require that where the Service requests evidence after filing, it must be submitted in one response.
In addition, as requested by a commenter, it clarifies that a case that is missing initial evidence will not result
in the loss of its priority date until a final decision is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised process encourages applicants and petitioners to obtain the necessary threshold evidence before filing
so that their case can be processed in order and without delay. However, it also allows people who fail to file this threshold
evidence a limited period to submit the missing evidence. A time limit of 12 weeks was set because while the Service
wants to afford people an opportunity to correct a filing deficiency, we must balance that with ensuring that the process
does not encourage people to file before they have a complete application or petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an applicant or petitioner does not submit the missing initial evidence within the time limit, the application
or petition will be automatically denied for lack of initial evidence. While the rule clarifies that an applicant
or petitioner may immediately refile after such a denial, it should be noted that if the subsequent case is filed without
the required initial evidence, it may be denied without a grace period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this process will normally be sufficient, there are situations where a person's immediate status in the United
States hinges on the application or petition, or he or she becomes entitled to a benefit because the case is pending.
For example, a person who files for adjustment of status would in certain instances be able to obtain an advance parole
to travel based on the pending application. An applicant for an employment authorization document may be entitled
to interim employment authorization because the Service cannot make a decision within a certain period. Applying
the general process outlined above in such situations would allow a person to obtain interim benefits based on an incomplete
application or petition while the Service waits for him or her to submit the necessary initial evidence, or because
he or she asks that an interview be rescheduled, delaying processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of an application or petition without the required initial evidence, or asking that a case be rescheduled,
effectively hampers our ability to make a definitive determination of eligibility. An applicant or petitioner may
not be allowed to either inadvertently or intentionally hamper the Service's ability to render a decision and as a
result gain a potential or actual benefit. Therefore, the Service considers processing time for any application
or petition to refer to time unhampered by the applicant or petitioner's action or lack of required action. This means
there is nothing under the applicant or petitioner's control that hampers our ability to make a final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the process outlined earlier, filing an application or petition without required initial evidence hampers
the Service's ability to render a final decision. Similarly, requesting a scheduled interview be rescheduled will
delay full adjudication of a request for benefits, and will require the Service to duplicate several processing and
review steps. The process must balance the need to ensure that persons do not receive undue interim benefits with the
need to ensure that any applicable statutory or regulatory processing timeframes are adhered to once we are no longer
hampered from making a decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in such circumstances the processing clock will stop with respect to any time limits for adjudicating
the request for Service action at the time the Service sends a notice for initial evidence, and it will start over at
the time the Service receives the evidence. Similarly, the processing clock will start over when the Service receives
a request to reschedule an interview. The clock stops because the lack of required initial evidence or request for
rescheduling hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. It starts over again because to merely have it
resume would effectively shorten the Service's processing window because we have to duplicate several processing
and review steps because the application or petition was not complete when submitted or because we were asked to reschedule
the interview. Having the clock start over also serves to encourage the filing of complete applications, which, as
indicated above, is in the legitimate interests of all applicants and petitioners as well as in the legitimate interest
of the Service. However, this process also preserves the processing clock concept because it does not suspend the
clock indefinitely until we can resume processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Service is hampered from making a final decision, interim benefits will not be granted based on a case held
in suspense for the submission of requested initial evidence, except that the Service will normally allow the applicant
or person the petition is for to remain in the country while an application or petition to extend or obtain status while
it is pending. In addition, employment authorization previously accorded based on the same status and employment
as that requested in the current application or petition may continue uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20)
notwithstanding the case being held in suspense for the submission of necessary initial evidence. The Service of
course reserves the right to pursue other actions to seek the removal of persons notwithstanding a pending application
where required, such as in cases involving fraud or clearly frivolous applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also provides for denial where evidence submitted later does not establish eligibility at the time of filing.
The evidence must establish that the applicant or petitioner was eligible for the benefit when the application or
petition was filed. As suggested, the Service will monitor the rate of cases in which initial evidence is not submitted
at the time of filing as a way of determining how we can further clarify form instructions, and to determine if we need
to implement other changes, including those originally proposed in the rule, in order to ensure equity and fairness
to all applicants and petitioners.

Additional Evidence, Documents and Translations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At times, an application or petition will meet threshold evidence requirements, but the evidence submitted, or other
evidence available, rises additional questions. In such instances the Service usually provides the applicant or
petitioner an opportunity to respond or to submit additional evidence about the points in question in support of the
claim. Several commenters asked that the Service extend the 60-day period provided for response, as least where good
cause was demonstrated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule has been revised to provide 12 weeks for such submissions. However, waiting for the applicant or petitioner
to respond hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. Since the applicant has already met the threshold
evidence requirements, the processing clock will merely stop as of the date of the request. It will resume at the point
where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or a request for a decision based on the evidence
submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asserted that the Service should eliminate the distinction between primary and secondary evidence,
and accept any type of credible document with an application or petition. However, historically there have been serious
problems establishing the reliability of many kinds of documents. Further, it is important in judging a claim to know
whether documents that should normally exist actually do.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a woman who files a petition claiming someone is her adult son. There is no birth certificate or other civil
or religious documents from around the time of the birth to support the claim, but she does have several documents issued
years later that suggest that he is her son. After analysis the Service may accept the claim, but the fact the birth certificate
and other documents dating from the birth do not exist is important to that analysis. We could not adequately review
the case if the record was silent about the types of documents that commonly exist. Without evidentiary guidelines,
the Service also would not know whether she merely forgot to attach them or whether they did not exist. This would mean
the Service would have to go back and ask, delaying processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as requested by several commenters, the Service has clarified the distinction between primary evidence,
secondary evidence and affidavits. The Service has also clarified the rule to indicate that a certification from
an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's Foreign
Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. The Service has also revised the rule as requested
to allow a person to file evidence showing that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain a required document
or certification of unavailability along with less definitive evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above changes will also apply to secondary evidence. However, because secondary evidence and affidavits are
inherently less reliable and, consequently, have less probative value than primary evidence, such secondary evidence
and affidavits must overcome the fact that more probative primary evidence is unavailable, affidavits must overcome
the absence of all other more probative forms of evidence that would normally be available. If the Service concludes
that primary or secondary evidence should be available, the applicant or petitioner will be asked to obtain it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested that the rule be revised to only require a translation of the relevant portion of a foreign
language document instead of a full translation. However, only requiring an extract leaves to the applicant or petitioner
and the translator the judgment of what is germane. The Service has found that in many instances the applicant or petitioner's
determination of what is germane is not consistent with the Service's. A full translation is necessary for us to fully
analyze documents submitted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed the proposed bar to retracting a withdrawal, asserting that an applicant or petitioner may
have a legitimate reason for again changing his or her mind. The rule does not question the legitimacy of a change of
heart or mind, nevertheless, under the rule, a withdrawal is considered definitive. An applicant or petitioner who
withdraws a case and later changes his or her mind again may refile a new application or petition. the Service has clarified
this in the rule, and has also clarified that a petitioner may withdraw an approved petition until such time as the beneficiary
has been admitted or has adjusted status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would allow a motion to reopen a case denied for lack of initial evidence, but would preclude a subsequent
administrative appeal. One commenter suggested that an appeal should be allowed. However, since the issue is simply
whether a stipulated document was or was not submitted, the avenue of a motion is a sufficient safeguard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the proposed rule allowing 30 days to file a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider
be extended to 60 days to give applicants and petitioners time to retain legal counsel and file a response. However,
the 30-day period provided is equivalent to that for filing an appeal, which itself was extended several years ago,
and thus will not be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed rule set the level of proof too high for motions to reopen. The provision
has accordingly been revised to clarify the facts that must be demonstrated in the motion. Another commenter asked
that the Service use this rulemaking to make all decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals available to the public.
The concern will be referred to the Executive Office of Immigration Review for future consideration.

Change of Status, Extension of Stay and Use of Form I&hyph;94
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provided that where a person demonstrated eligibility for an extension or change of status, the
application could be approved at the discretion of the Service. One commenter asserted that discretion should not
enter into the decision. However, sections 214 and 248 of the Immigration and Nationality Act give the Service discretionary
authority to approve or deny applications for extension or change of status. In addition, a decision on this type of
application, and on most other types of applications and petitions, is rarely a simple matter. An alien is not automatically
entitled to these types of benefits. The decision to grant a change of status or extension of stay involves weighing
various factors, and a judgement by the deciding official of whether to grant the benefit.

In response to a number of comments, this rule allows a worker's dependents to be included in a company's petition where
there is only one worker in the petition. This provision will go into effect at the time the form providing for this process
becomes available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A person was previously required to submit his or her original Form I&hyph;94, Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Record,
with an application to extend or change nonimmigrant status so the Service could annotate the Form I&hyph;94 with
its decision on the application. The rule proposed altering this process in certain cases to permit the filing of a
copy of the Form I&hyph;94. The notice of decision would serve as evidence of any decision and alteration to the terms
of the person's status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported this idea, suggesting it will eliminate problems with aliens not having evidence of
status while their application is pending, and that it will streamline filing. In fact, several asked why it was not
being extended to all such applications. However, several others opposed it, arguing that the change would create
yet another document employers would have to deal with, further confusing them as to who is authorized to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is moving to limit to two the number of INS documents employers are required to examine when a person applies
for employment: (a) Form I&hyph;551, Alien Registration Card, issued to permanent residents; and (b) Form I&hyph;688B,
Employment Authorization Document, also called an EAD, issued to persons who can accept employment in the open labor
market.

However, after determining that an alien is not otherwise authorized to work, an employer may file a petition to temporarily
employ him or her as a nonimmigrant. If the Service approves the petition, we notify the employer. If the alien is not
first required to be admitted in the status, and the Service's approval authorizes immediate employment, we include
this in the notice. The approval of such a petition does not authorize the alien to work elsewhere, but only for the employer
under the terms and conditions of the approved petition. An EAD is not necessary in such a context since the employer
has already determined the alien cannot work unless we approve its petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously when sending a notice that we had approved such a petition we also made a handwritten notation on the alien's
Form I&hyph;94. The computer system we are installing to improve service will allow us to replace such handwritten
notes with a computer generated notice that can be confirmed by the system. Therefore, the rulemaking proposed simplifying
filing requirements and allowing aliens to keep their existing Form I&hyph;94 as evidence of their status while their
new application is pending.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To eliminate any confusion, we are revising our approval notice to the employer to include a replacement Form I&hyph;94
that the employer can review and then give to the employee. In the interim the original Form I&hyph;94 must be filed
with the petition for annotation. The Service will publish a notice in the

Several commenters stated that applicants for asylum should be eligible for a refugee travel document. However,
an applicant for asylum is an applicant for a benefit, and does not acquire any status or travel authorization merely
as a result of having submitted the asylum application. It would be inappropriate to grant a travel document until
a decision is made that the person is eligible for asylum. If an asylum applicant chooses to leave the United States,
he or she may apply abroad for refugee status to reenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested clarification that a refugee travel document may be accepted in lieu of a passport as well as
a visa. The final rule clearly refers to the document as a travel document issued pursuant to article 28 of the United
Nations Convention of July 28, 1951 for the purpose of travel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service received many comments regarding advance parole. Although this subject needs to be addressed, the Service
has decided to defer this action to a separate rulemaking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters addressed the reentry permit provisions of the proposed rule. Most suggested that the proposed
provision precluding issuance to most aliens who have been abroad for more than 4 of the last 5 years since becoming
a permanent resident was too limiting, did not provide for exceptions, and did not recognize the needs of permanent
residents who are employed by multi-national companies on extended assignments abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was explained in the proposed rule, the Service's intent was to minimize the current broad review by the Government
of all the circumstances surrounding a person's absence, and instead focus on the simpler issue of how long he or she
has been gone. The language of the rule was written in such a way that a person is able to stay abroad for almost 6 years,
with only short trips back to the United States every 2 years, before he or she would become ineligible for a reentry
permit. This standard would have meant some people would not have received a permit, but, again, this ineligibility
in and of itself would not have jeopardized permanent resident status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe a clear standard is preferable to an abstract one in which the Government must look at the person's intent,
location of domiciles and assets, employment circumstances, and other circumstances of his or her life and make a
discretionary decision of whether to issue a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, upon further consideration, the Service recognizes that there may be those who will be unable to obtain a
travel document other than the reentry permit. Therefore, the rule will be modified so that rather than precluding
the issuance of the document, any such further issuance will be limited to a validity of one year. This simply means
that a person who remains abroad for more than the specified period will thereafter have to return annually to file
an application for a reentry permit instead of every 2 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, based on the comments received, the Service has revised the list of exceptions to the time limit rule to include
permanent residents defined in 8 CFR 211.1(b)(1)(i)(B), 211.1(b)(1)(ii) or 211.1(b)(4), as well as persons employed
by a public or national organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute, and their dependents.
The rule also exempts professional athletes who compete in the United States and worldwide.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that the Service issue to any applicant for a replacement alien registration card an
interim work authorization document while it considers his or her application. However, this would encourage people
to file merely to get a document to enter the labor market. Under such circumstances, it would be inappropriate for
the Service to give a benefit before having an opportunity to determine if the person is actually eligible for it. Instead,
the Service is taking steps to accelerate the processing of this type of application in order to deliver a replacement
card more rapidly to those who are eligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters pointed to the situation of permanent residents in exclusion or deportation proceedings, and
suggested that the rule should clearly prohibit the confiscation of the permanent resident alien registration card
until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered. The rule has been clarified to indicate that such a person
is entitled to evidence of permanent resident status until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As requested by several commenters, the Service has modified the proposed rule to clearly allow for the concurrent
or subsequent filing of an application for further action on an application or petition, and to provide flexibility
to incorporate additional, similar processes by revising the form. The Service has also made minor editorial changes
in the rule for clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that to further streamline processing, the Service should require applicants to mail all
adjustment of status applications to the INS Service Centers, and eliminate the mandatory interview requirement.
The Service has since addressed this issue in a separate rulemaking, which was published in the

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation
merely sets forth evidentiary rules and processes by which persons may apply for and receive certain immigration
benefits and does not alter substantive requirements. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning
of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.

An application or petition received in a Service office shall be stamped to show the time and date of actual receipt
and, unless otherwise specified in part 204 or part 245 of this chapter, shall be regarded as filed when so stamped,
if it is properly signed and executed and the required fee is attached or a fee waiver is granted. An application which
is not properly signed or is submitted with the wrong fee shall be rejected as improperly filed. Rejected applications,
and ones in which the check or other financial instrument is returned as not payable, will not retain a filing date.
An application or petition taken to a local Service office for the completion of biometric information prior to filing

 If a check or other financial instrument used to pay a filing fee is subsequently returned as not payable, the remitter
shall be notified and requested to immediately pay the filing fee and associated service charge within 14 days, without
extension. If the application or petition is pending and these charges are not paid, it shall be rejected as improperly
filed. If it was already approved, and these charges are not paid, it shall be automatically revoked because it was
improperly filed. If it was already denied, revoked, or abandoned, that decision will not be affected by the non-payment
of the filing fee. A new fee will be required with any new application or petition. Any fee and service charges collected
as the result of collection activities or legal action on the prior application or petition shall be used to cover the
cost of the previous rejection, revocation, or other action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The non-existence or other unavailability of required evidence creates a presumption of ineligibility. If a required
document, such as a birth or marriage certificate, does not exist or cannot be obtained, an applicant or petitioner
must demonstrate this and submit secondary evidence, such as church or school records, pertinent to the facts at issue.
If secondary evidence also does not exist or cannot be obtained, the applicant or petitioner must demonstrate the
unavailability of both the required document and relevant secondary evidence, and submit two or more affidavits,
sworn to or affirmed by persons who are not parties to the petition who have direct personal knowledge of the event and
circumstances. Secondary evidence must overcome the unavailability of primary evidence, and affidavits must overcome
the unavailability of both primary and secondary evidence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where a record does not exist, the applicant or petitioner must submit an original written statement on government
letterhead establishing this from the relevant government or other authority. The statement must indicate the reason
the record does not exist, and indicate whether similar records for the time and place are available. However, a certification
from an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's
Foreign Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. An applicant or petitioner who has
not been able to acquire the necessary document or statement from the relevant foreign authority may submit evidence
that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain the required document or statement. However, where the Service
finds that such documents or statements are generally available, it may require that the applicant or petitioner
submit the required document or statement.

and other statements, must be submitted in the original unless previously filed with the Service. When submission
is required, expired Service documents must be submitted in the original, as must Service documents required to be
annotated to indicate the decision. In all other instances, unless the relevant regulations or instructions specifically
require that an original document be filed with an application or petition, an ordinary legible photocopy may be submitted.
Original documents submitted when not required will remain a part of the record, even if the submission was not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where a copy of a document is submitted with an application or petition, the Service may at any time require that the
original document be submitted for review. If the requested original, other than one issued by the Service, is not
submitted within 12 weeks, the petition or application shall be denied or revoked. There shall be no appeal from a denial
or revocation based on the failure to submit an original document upon the request of the Service to substantiate a
previously submitted copy. Further, an applicant or petitioner may not move to reopen or reconsider the proceeding
based on the subsequent availability of the document. An original document submitted pursuant to a Service request
shall be returned to the petitioner or applicant when no longer required.

Withdrawal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant or petitioner may withdraw an application or petition at any time until a decision is issued by the Service
or, in the case of an approved petition, until the person is admitted or granted adjustment or change of status, based
on the petition. However, a withdrawal may not be retracted.

Testimony. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service may require the taking of testimony, and may direct any necessary investigation. When a statement is taken
from and signed by a person, he or she shall, upon request, be given a copy without fee. Any allegations made subsequent
to filing an application or petition which are in addition to, or in substitution for, those originally made, shall
be filed in the same manner as the original application, petition, or document, and acknowledged under oath thereon.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Request for evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If there is evidence of ineligibility in the record, an application or petition shall be denied on that basis notwithstanding
any lack of required initial evidence. If the application or petition was pre-screened by the Service prior to filing
and was filed even though the applicant or petitioner was informed that the required initial evidence was missing,
the application or petition shall be denied for failure to contain the necessary evidence. Except as otherwise provided
in this chapter, in other instances where there is no evidence of ineligibility, and initial evidence or eligibility
information is missing or the Service finds that the evidence submitted either does not fully establish eligibility
for the requested benefit or raises underlying questions regarding eligibility, the Service shall request the missing
initial evidence, and may request additional evidence, including blood tests. In such cases, the applicant or petitioner
shall be given 12 weeks to respond to a request for evidence. Additional time may not be granted. Within this period
the applicant or petitioner may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Submit all the requested initial or additional evidence;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Submit some or none of the requested additional evidence and ask for a decision based on the record; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Withdraw the application or petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Request for appearance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant, a petitioner, and/or a beneficiary may be required to appear for an interview. A petitioner shall also
be notified when an interview notice is mailed or issued to a beneficiary. The person may appear as requested by the
Service or, prior to the date and time of the interview: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The person to be interviewed may, for good cause, request that the interview be rescheduled; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The applicant or petitioner may withdraw the application or petition.

Effect on processing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The priority date of a properly filed petition shall not be affected by a request for missing initial evidence or request
for other evidence. If an application or petition is missing required initial evidence, or an applicant, petitioner,
or beneficiary requests that an interview be rescheduled, any time period imposed on Service processing will start
over from the date of receipt of the required initial evidence or request for interview rescheduling. If the Service
requests that the applicant or petitioner submit additional evidence or respond to other than a request for initial
evidence, any time limitation imposed on the Service for processing will be suspended as of the date of the request.
It will resume at the same point where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or response, or a
request for a decision based on the evidence submitted.

Effect on interim benefits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interim benefits will not be granted based on an application or petition held in suspense for the submission of requested
initial evidence, except that the applicant or beneficiary will normally be allowed to remain while an application
or petition to extend or obtain status while in the United States is pending. The Service may choose to pursue other
actions to seek removal of a person notwithstanding the pending application. Employment authorization previously
accorded based on the same status and employment as that requested in the current application or petition may continue
uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20) during the suspense period.

Effect where evidence submitted in response to a request does not establish eligibility at the time of filing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application or petition shall be denied where evidence submitted in response to a request for initial evidence
does not establish filing eligibility at the time the application or petition was filed. An application or petition
shall be denied where any application or petition upon which it was based was filed subsequently.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If all requested initial evidence and requested additional evidence is not submitted by the required date, the application
or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied. Except as provided in &sect;335.6 of
this chapter, if a person requested to appear for an interview does not appear, the Service does not receive his or her
request for rescheduling by the date of the interview, or the applicant or petitioner has not withdrawn the application
or petition, the application or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of request for decision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an applicant or petitioner does not submit all requested additional evidence and requests a decision based on
the evidence already submitted, a decision shall be issued based on the record. Failure to submit requested evidence
which precludes a material line of inquiry shall be grounds for denying the application or petition. Failure to appear
for a required interview, or to give required testimony, shall result in the denial of any related application or petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of withdrawal or denial due to abandonment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service's acknowledgement of a withdrawal may not be appealed. A denial due to abandonment may not be appealed,
but an applicant or petitioner may file a motion to reopen under &sect;103.5. Withdrawal or denial due to abandonment
does not preclude the filing of a new application or petition with a new fee. However, the priority or processing date
of a withdrawn or abandoned application or petition may not be applied to a later application petition. Withdrawal
or denial due to abandonment shall not itself affect the new proceeding; but the facts and circumstances surrounding
the prior application or petition shall otherwise be material to the new application or petition.

Verifying claimed permanent resident status. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The status of an applicant or petitioner who claims that he or she is a permanent resident of the United States will be
verified from official records of the Service. The term official records, as used herein, includes Service files,
arrival manifests, arrival records, Service index cards, Immigrant Identification Cards, Certificates of Registry,
Declarations of Intention issued after July 1, 1929, Alien Registration Receipt Cards Forms AR&hyph;3, AR&hyph;103,
I&hyph;151 or I&hyph;551), passports, and reentry permits. To constitute an official record a Service index card
must bear a designated immigrant visa symbol and must have been prepared by an authorized official of the Service in
the course of processing immigrant admissions or adjustments to permanent resident status. Other cards, certificates,
declarations, permits, and passports must have been issued or endorsed by the Service to show admission for permanent
residence. Except as otherwise provided in 8 CFR part 101, and in the absence of countervailing evidence, such official
records shall be regarded as establishing lawful admission for permanent residence.

Requirements for motion to reopen. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be provided in the reopened proceeding and be supported by affidavits
or other documentary evidence. A motion to reopen an application or petition denied due to abandonment must be filed
with evidence that the decision was in error because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The requested evidence was not material to the issue of eligibility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The required initial evidence was submitted with the application or petition, or the request for initial evidence
or additional information or appearance was complied with during the allotted period; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The request for additional information or appearance was sent to an address other than that on the application,
petition, or notice of representation, or that the applicant or petitioner advised the Service, in writing, of a change
of address or change of representation subsequent to filing and before the Service's request was sent, and the request
did not go to the new address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for motion to reconsider. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration and be supported by any pertinent precedent decisions
to establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or Service policy. A motion to reconsider
a decision on an application or petition must, when filed, also establish that the decision was incorrect based on
the evidence of record at the time of the initial decision.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations to permit district directors,
acting alone, to waive a nonimmigrant visa or passport under section 212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act in individual cases, if satisfied that a nonimmigrant alien is unable to present these documents because of an
unforeseen emergency. Formerly, in such circumstances the district director was required to seek concurrence of
the Department of State Visa Office to grant a waiver of the nonimmigrant visa or passport. In eliminating the step
of seeking concurrence on each waiver, this amendment will save resources for both agencies and reduce the time it
takes to admit certain nonimmigrant aliens.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary of State and the Attorney General,
acting jointly, to waive a nonimmigrant alien's visa or passport when an alien is unable to present the required documents
due to an unforeseen emergency. Previously, when such a nonimmigrant appeared at a port of entry, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service district director was required to seek the concurrence of the Department of State Visa
Office prior to granting the waiver. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the Commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service by title 8 U.S.C. section 103 and to the Director of the Visa Office of the Department of State
by title 8 U.S.C. section 104, the Commissioner and the Director of the Visa Office, acting jointly, determined that
the previous procedure was unnecessarily burdensome. Officers of the Department of State concurred with the recommendations
from the ports of entry in over 95% of the cases presented. Having the district director exercise the function of the
Department of State Visa Office simultaneously with the function assigned to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service will save resources for both agencies and result in a quicker admission of the alien. If the district director
is satisfied that the alien failed to present a passport or a visa because of an unforeseen emergency and that the alien
should be granted the waiver, then the procedure at the ports of entry will remain the same. The alien will fill out an
application for the waiver, the information will be checked, and a fee will be charged. The Department of State is promulgating
a similar regulation that amends &sect;41.2 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (The Service) published a proposed rule, with a request for comments,
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 30, 1991, at 56 FR 36028, amending 8 CFR 212.1(g). The comment period ended on August 29, 1991. The Service received
three comments. One commentor endorsed the rule's practicality but recommended a change in language in the phrase
``unable to obtain the required documents'' so that it reads ``unable to present the required documents''. The Service
agrees that the change improves the rule by allowing waivers to be granted in cases where the alien possesses the required
documents but cannot produce them at the port of entry. This change is incorporated in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentor expressed concern that language in the proposed regulation might mislead a reader to think that
the Service will seek concurrence from the Visa Office without first determining that the alien is entitled to a waiver
of documents. Such a procedure would be a deviation from the Service's past practice rather than a continuation of
it, as the Service intends, except for eliminating the step of seeking concurrence from the Department of State Visa
Office. Language in the final rule has been changed to clarify this point.

Another commentor noted that transportation companies cannot board an alien passenger traveling in emergency circumstances
who lacks the required documents without incurring a fine at the port of entry. The commentor recommended adding a
provision to the rule which would specify the steps a carrier must take to board such a passenger without incurring
a fine. This rule is not intended to expand the circumstances under which an alien may apply for a waiver of documents,
only to simplify the administrative procedure for granting a waiver, and therefore the recommendation will not be
incorporated into the final rule.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule
merely reflects an agreement reached between the Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service
that results in a less burdensome administrative procedure. In addition, members of the public are serviced in a more
expeditious manner as a result of the effect of this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, November 29, 1990, dramatically altered the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant classification. IMMACT, among other things, removed prominent aliens from the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
classification and required prospective employers to obtain an approved labor condition application from the Department
of Labor prior to the admission of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to concerns raised by a number of interested parties, Congress incorporated numerous provisions in the
Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;232, December
12, 1991, which amended some of the provisions created by IMMACT. Specifically, Public Law 102&hyph;232 amended
the definition of an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant alien by removing the requirement that the intending employer obtain
an approved labor condition application prior to the alien's admission into the United States, amended the criteria
which the Secretary of Labor could use in invoking the penalty provisions relating to misrepresentations and omissions
on the labor condition application, and, lastly, addressed the issue of foreign physicians coming to the United States
to perform services in the medical profession.

Prior to the passage of Public Law 102&hyph;232, petitioners in H&hyph;1B cases were required to submit a copy of an
approved labor condition application with the petition. Public Law 102&hyph;232 amended this language by requiring
only that petitioners attach a certification from the Secretary of Labor indicating that the petitioner has filed
a labor condition application with the Secretary of Labor. The interim rule contained language reflecting this amendment
to the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that a petitioner could meet this statutory requirement by merely submitting a copy of the
labor condition application without waiting for the Department of Labor to certify the labor condition application.
However, submitting a copy of the labor condition application is not sufficient to show that the application has been
filed. Only when the application has been certified can the Service be assured that the petitioner has complied with
the filing requirement. Therefore, the Service did not adopt this recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that IMMACT imposed a number of penalties on employers who failed to meet certain conditions of
the labor condition application process. Section 212(n)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act states that in those situations the
Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed by the offending employer under section 204 or 214(c) of the Act
for a period of one year. The commenter noted that &sect;214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the interim regulation indicated only that the Attorney General shall not approve petitions under the H&hyph;1B
category. In response to this comment the final rule will be amended to indicate that this provision applies to petitions
filed under both sections 204 and 214(c) of the Act as required by statute.

One commenter suggested that petitioners in H&hyph;1B and H&hyph;2B cases should be required to post a bond in order
to prove to the Service that the return transportation requirement will be met. It is the opinion of the Service that
the statute and regulations clearly state the requirement that a petitioner in these instances is responsible for
the alien beneficiary's return transportation. The filing of the petition is sufficient assurance to the Service
that the petitioner will comply with this requirement.

Prior to the passage of IMMACT, alien graduates of foreign medical schools were excluded from classification as H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants unless they were coming to the United States pursuant to an invitation from a public or nonprofit private
educational or research institution or agency to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for such institution or
agency. These physicians were not authorized to perform direct patient care unless it was incidental to the teaching
or research. This restriction, however, was not contained in IMMACT, thereby allowing graduates of foreign medical
schools to perform direct patient care in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;232 addressed the issue of foreign physicians coming to the United States to perform services
in the medical profession. The legislation provided that these aliens could obtain H&hyph;1B classification in
either of two ways.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First (mirroring the pre-IMMACT statutory language), an alien may be accorded H&hyph;1B classification if the alien
is coming to the United States pursuant to an invitation from a public or nonprofit private educational or research
institution or agency to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for such institution or agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, an alien may be accorded H&hyph;1B classification if he or she has passed the Federation Licensing Examination
(FLEX) or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Eligibility under
this criterion also requires a demonstration that the alien has competency in oral and written English or that the
alien has graduated from a school of medicine accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary
of Education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the interim rule, it was stated that there was no distinction between alien physicians educated
in the United States and those educated abroad and that both had to pass the Federation Licensing Examination (FLEX)
in order to be classified as an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant in order to perform direct patient care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters stated that the FLEX requirement should not be applicable to alien graduates of United States medical
schools since, over the previous decade, the Service has consistently permitted these aliens to engage in direct
patient care under the H&hyph;1B classification. These commenters also noted that graduates of United States medical
schools are not normally required to take the FLEX examination as part of their training and licensing requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the interim rule, the Service altered its position on this issue, reaffirming that
the FLEX requirement did not apply to aliens educated at United States medical schools. This position now will be codified
in the final rule. It should be noted, however, that the FLEX requirement does apply to aliens educated in foreign medical
schools, including schools in Canada. The final rule will be amended to reflect the Service's present position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters noted that aliens of national or international renown in the field of medicine, pursuant to section
101(a)(41) of the Act, are not considered graduates of a medical school and should be exempt for the FLEX requirement.
The Service agrees with this comment and the final rule will be amended to indicate that aliens of national or international
renown in the field of medicine are exempt from the FLEX requirement as well as the other requirements set forth in section
212(j)(2) of the Act. They are, however, required to meet the licensure requirements for the state of intended employment.

Equivalency to the FLEX 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;232 provides that alien physicians who wish to perform patient care in the United States must,
among other things, pass the FLEX examination or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services. By notice published on September 16, 1992 at 57 FR 42755, the Secretary of Health and Human Services
designated Parts I, II, and III of the National Board of Medical Examiners certifying examinations and the Steps 1,
2, and 3 examinations of the United States Medical Licensing Examinations program as equivalent to the FLEX. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six commenters suggested that the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), the Canadian medical licensing
procedure, or a State license should also be determined to be equivalent to the FLEX. A determination that the LMCC
or a state license is equivalent to the FLEX is outside the scope of the Service's authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

Competency in the English Language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;232 also requires that graduates of medical schools coming to the United States to perform services
in the medical professions must demonstrate competency in oral and written English or be a graduate of a school of medicine
accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Education. The interim rule contains the
requirement that a petitioner may demonstrate English competency by submitting evidence that the alien has passed
the English test given by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). The interim regulation
did not contain any additional tests or mechanisms to establish competency in the English language but it was stated
in the preamble to the interim rule that the Service would consider other suggestions to demonstrate competency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) should be recognized as an alternate
test to establish English competency. Since the results of the TOEFL are reported as a raw score which must be interpreted
by the entity reviewing the score, and the administrators of the test have not established a passing grade for the test,
the Service cannot adopt this suggestion since it does not have the expertise or resources to interpret this test.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters also suggested that the Service recognize that graduates of medical schools located in an English-speaking
country in which the language of instruction is also English have competency in the English language. Since the statutory
language already addresses the issue of language competency in relation to graduation from certain universities,
the adoption of this suggestion would be in conflict with the statutory language.

Licensure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule requires that a petition for a physician coming to the United States to perform services in the medical
profession must be accompanied by evidence that the physician has a license or authorization required by the State
of intended employment, if the state requires such license or authorization. This language was adopted to ensure
that at the time the petition was filed the physician and met the regulatory requirements relating to the practice
of medicine in the state of intended employment. The regulation also recognizes that, in certain instances, a state
may not require a physician to obtain an actual medical license in order to perform the duties of a particular position.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that the regulations of the state of intended employment should dictate which type of license,
if any, should be required by the Service. This suggested regulatory change is unnecessary since it is already provided
for in the language of the interim rule at &sect;214.2(h)(4)(viii)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter also noted that certain physicians employer by the United States government, such as the Veterans Administration,
are not required to possess a license issued by the state of intended employment hut merely require a license from any
state. The final rule has been amended to accommodate this situation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that an alien physician should not be required to obtain a medical license if the alien is not
coming to the United States to perform patient care. As written, the interim rule requires that licensure must be obtained
only in those situations where the alien beneficiary will be performing clinical care. An alien physician coming
to fill a position which does not normally require licensure, e.g., medical research, would not be required to obtain
a license. Thus, this suggestion need not be adopted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial approval of an H&hyph;1B petition is currently limited to three years. One commenter suggested that H&hyph;1B
petitions should be approved for the validity period of the supporting labor condition application, not to exceed
six years. The Service does not deem it appropriate to consider extending the initial validity period of H&hyph;1B
petitions without first soliciting public comment on the issue. This issue will be addressed in a future proposed
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule
merely clarifies provisions of the MTINA which establish certain new petitioning procedures for H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
and new eligibility criteria for foreign physicians seeking employment in the medical profession in this country,
and therefore has a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 economic impact on small entities. This rule is not considered to be significant within section 3(f) of E.O. 12866,
nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance
with E.O. 12612.

This rule amends the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) relating to applications
for lawful temporary residence under section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Specifically, this rule
amends the special rule for determination of public charge to provide that aliens who are self-supporting despite
earning income below the poverty level may be admissible without having to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under
8 CFR 245a.2(k) (2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 45235&hyph;45236, an interim rule with request for comments to amend 8 CFR part 245a. The interim rule was issued

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19
``Regional Jet'' Series 100 airplanes. This action requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to limit
altitude and airspeed operations of the airplane under certain conditions of hydraulic system failure. This amendment
is prompted by a report of sheared-off shear pins found on one airplane's elevator dampers. The actions specified
in this AD are intended to prevent undampened vibration of the elevators in normal cruise conditions when combined
with hydraulic system failures, a condition which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 ``Regional Jet'' Series 100 airplanes. Transport
Canada Aviation advises that one operator of these airplanes found that the shear pins on the airplane elevator dampers
had sheared off. This finding was made during a routine check of the airplane. The cause of the pin failure has not been
determined. Failure of the shear pins on the elevator damper, if not detected and corrected, may lead to undampened
vibration of the elevators during normal cruise conditions when combined with hydraulic system failures. This situation
could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada, Transport Canada Aviation issued a Canadian
airworthiness directive on December 17, 1993, that restricts operation of these airplanes to certain altitude and
airspeed limits under various conditions of hydraulic system failure. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport
Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of
this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent undampened vibration of the elevators during
normal cruise conditions in the event of hydraulic system failures, which could result in reduced controllability
of the airplane. This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual
(AFM) to restrict altitude and airspeed operations under conditions of single or double hydraulic failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider additional
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;230&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

On September 10, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that alters VOR Federal Airway
V&hyph;220, located in Colorado and Nebraska, to coincide with the scheduled opening date of the new Denver International
Airport (58 FR 47631). This action is necessary to incorporate a recent amendment to V&hyph;220 between Grand Junction,
CO, and Meeker, CO, which became effective on November 11, 1993 (58 FR 51010).

 This final rule authorizes the District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to exercise the Department
of State's function with respect to the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement under the provisions of section
212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The rule eliminates time consuming procedures for obtaining
the concurrence of passport and/or visa waivers, and benefits certain nonimmigrant aliens who, because of unforeseen
circumstances, are subjected to delays when seeking admission to the United States without the required documents.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 30, 1991, the Department of State published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 36029. The rule proposed
to amend part 41, &sect;41.2(j), which provided for the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement by the District
Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at the port of entry, with the concurrence of the designated
State Department official, if such officials were satisfied that the nonimmigrant alien was unable to obtain the
required documentation because of an unforeseen emergency. This final rule authorizes the District Director of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the port of entry to exercise the Department of State's function with
respect to the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement under the provisions of INA 212(d)(4)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period the Department received only one comment. The commenting organization noted that under
the proposed regulations nonimmigrants who are ``unable to obtain'' the required documents may benefit from such
a waiver. The commenter suggested that the proposed language be amended to read ``unable to present'' the required
documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the historical files reveals that the language in question has been in use since at least 1958. The focus
at that time was on fact patterns in which the alien indeed could not for geographical, political, and other reasons
obtain the required documents. Circumstances have changed radically since that time. The Department believes that
the recommendation to change the word ``obtain'' to read ``present'' has merit as it more accurately reflects current
world circumstances and the intent of the statute. In order to gain admission to the United States an alien must present
the required pertinent documentation, whether one has the ability or not to obtain such. Absent such documentation,
the immigration officer in charge at the port of entry must decide whether the applicant for admission is indeed qualified
for the desired nonimmigrant visa classification and whether the inability to present the required documentation
was due to an unforeseen emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Department wishes to clarify the limited extent of the authority delegated to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Although the proposed rule permits the District Director to waive the documentary requirements
of INA 212(a)(7)(B), the Department of State will continue to exercise the authority vested in the Secretary of State
and the Attorney General under the provisions of INA 212(d)(4)(A) relating to the joint concurrence in documentary
waivers, except in the circumstances described in &sect;41.2(j) of this final rule. Consequently, this final rule
makes minor modifications to the text of the regulation as discussed in the preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is not considered to be a major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291 nor is it expected to have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition,
this rule does not impose information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980. This rule has been revised as required by E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith.

port of entry concludes that the alien is unable to present the required documents because of an unforeseen emergency.
Any waiver of the visa or passport requirement may be granted by the INS district director pursuant to INA 212(d)(4)(A)
without the prior concurrence of the Department of State in each case in which the district director concludes that
the alien's claim of emergency circumstances is legitimate and bona fide and that approval of the waiver would be appropriate
under all of the attendant facts and circumstances.

 This rule revises currently applicable multifamily and health facility coinsurance regulations to eliminate the
requirement that the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer
responsibility on current coinsured mortgages held by a defaulting lender-issuer before requesting full insurance
endorsement by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The purpose of the rule is to eliminate a current regulatory
requirement which has proved to be time-consuming and, in most cases, unnecessary.

 The Department's former regulations concerning GNMA's right to assignment of coinsured mortgages were found at
24 CFR 251.827 (Multifamily Coinsurance_New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation), &sect;252.827 (Coinsurance
of Nursing Homes and Related Facilities), and &sect;255.827 (Coinsurance of Mortgages Covering Existing Multifamily
Projects), before their recent removal as part of the termination of the Coinsurance program sections on right to
assignment provided that, for any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer,
GNMA will first attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender by soliciting offers
to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring
lenders that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the Commissioner and that are also
GNMA issuers. If GNMA rejects all offers or no offers are received, GNMA will then have the right to perfect an assignment
of the Mortgage to itself. The Commissioner will endorse any Mortgage assigned to GNMA as provided by this section
for full insurance effective as of the date of assignment in accordance with the appropriate provisions of title 24
of the Code of Federal Regulations.

On October 10, 1990, a final rule was published (55 FR 41312) terminating the FHA multifamily coinsurance programs
and revising parts 251, 252 and 255. As a result of the final rule, parts 251, 252 and 255 each now consist of a single section
dealing with the program phase-out process. However, while the former rule's provisions are no longer included in
the Code of Federal Regulations, those regulations in effect before November 12, 1990 continue to govern the rights
and obligations of mortgagors, coinsuring lenders and HUD in existence before the termination of the coinsurance
programs. The effect of this rule is to revise those regulations as they relate to the handling of mortgage assignments
to GNMA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 15, 1992 the Department published a proposed rule (57 FR 59314) identical in text to this final rule. No
comments were received from the public concerning this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In lieu of the above-quoted paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), this rule provides that ``For any Coinsured Mortgage that
is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the
mortgage to itself. However, before exercising this right, GNMA will attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another
eligible coinsuring lender (unless it determines, with the agreement of the Commissioner, that the attempt would
prove ineffectual because of market or other conditions). The assignment will be attempted by soliciting offers
to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring
lenders that are also GNMA issuers and that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the
Commissioner.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the facts that (a) the authority to coinsure mortgages has been terminated; (b) for the most part, no market exists
for the purchase of coinsurance servicing rights; and (c) none of the few remaining approved coinsuring lenders has
shown any interest to date in assuming additional coinsuring risk by assignment of loans from GNMA, implementation
of the regulatory requirement earlier set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) has proved to be a time-consuming,
burdensome and fruitless process. Therefore, this rule amends parts 251, 252 and 255 to eliminate the requirement
that GNMA, in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer responsibility on current coinsured mortgages
before perfecting assignment of the Coinsured Mortgage to itself and requesting full insurance endorsement by FHA.

This final rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget as a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993.
Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are a part of the public docket file in the office of the Rules Docket
Clerk listed at the beginning of this preamble.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is procedural
in nature. It effects no substantive changes in HUD programs or policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was listed as item number 1540 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56431) under Executive order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule do not have Federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under
the Order. No programmatic or policy changes result from this rule's promulgation which would affect existing relationships
between the Federal Government and State and local governments.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is procedural in nature and no significant change in existing
HUD policies or programs impacting on the family result from promulgation of this rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking sets forth criteria that EPA must consider when exercising its discretionary authority to impose
sanctions on a statewide basis pursuant to the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act). If EPA makes one of the findings
of State implementation plan (SIP) deficiency described in the Act, EPA may impose an emissions offset or highway
funding sanction on any portion of the State that the Administrator determines is reasonable and appropriate for
the purpose of ensuring that the requirements of the Act relating to plans are met. This rulemaking establishes the
criteria EPA shall use in exercising its discretionary authority during the 24-month period following a finding
of a plan deficiency to ensure that these sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis when one or more political subdivisions
are principally responsible for such deficiency. In addition, EPA describes the discretionary sanctions provision
and EPA's anticipated application of these sanctions ``at any time'' after the Agency makes a finding.

I. Overview

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is promulgating criteria under section 110(m) of the Act to ensure that, during the 24-month period following
a finding, disapproval, or determination (hereinafter ``finding'') referred to in section 179(a), sanctions pursuant
to section 110(m) are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible
for such deficiency. Thus, these criteria apply only in the limited circumstance in which EPA is considering the imposition
of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) within 24 months after the Agency makes a section 179(a) finding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 28, 1992 (57 FR 44534), EPA proposed criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant
to section 110(m) of the Act may not be applied statewide. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion
of the background of the Act, of the proposed criteria, and of the provisions of section 179 and section 110(m) (see
57 FR 44534&hyph;44535). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;52.30(c) of the rule provides five criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant
to section 110(m) may not be imposed statewide. If at least one political subdivision meets all five of the criteria,
then that political subdivision will be considered principally responsible, and EPA will not impose sanctions on
a statewide basis. Rather, EPA will impose sanctions only on the areas of the State for which EPA determines it is reasonable
and appropriate to impose sanctions. If all of the criteria are not met by at least one political subdivision, then
no political subdivision is principally responsible, and EPA will use its discretion to determine whether to apply
statewide sanctions. However, if EPA, using its discretion, initially determines that less-than-statewide sanctions
should be applied, the Agency will not need to consider the criteria; EPA will impose sanctions on those political
subdivisions the Agency has determined to be reasonable and appropriate. Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case
basis and each action will be subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure
Act.

As noted in EPA's proposed rule, the Agency will follow notice-and-comment rulemaking in every instance that EPA
anticipates imposing section 110(m) sanctions (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992). In each rulemaking action, the
public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed geographic scope of the sanctions, the timing of the sanctions,
and the order in which the two available sanctions will be imposed. To the extent the public has commented on these issues
as a general matter in this rulemaking action, EPA has responded by suggesting that the issue is more appropriately
raised in independent rulemaking actions in which section 110(m) sanctions are proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule, EPA has changed four provisions from the proposal based on comments received regarding specific
details of the regulatory text. They are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In &sect;52.30(a)(2), the definition of ``required activity'' was revised in two ways. First, the phrase ``may
include, but is not limited to'' was deleted from the definition. Second, the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element''
is replaced by the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' These two changes were made in order to follow more clearly the language
of section 110(m). Since section 110(m) refers only to actions required with respect to a ``plan or plan item,'' EPA
agrees that the phrase ``may include, but is not limited to'' is unnecessary because it appears to imply EPA has authority
to impose sanctions with respect to findings other than those for a plan or plan item. Furthermore, since section 110(m)
uses the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' EPA believes it would be more consistent to use that phrase in the regulatory
language rather than the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The terms ``plan or plan items'' are added to the definitions section of the rule, &sect;52.30(a)(4), and are defined
as follows: ``For purposes of &sect;52.30, the terms `plan' or `plan item' mean an implementation plan or portion
of an implementation plan or action needed to prepare such plan required by the Act, as amended in 1990, or in response
to a SIP Call under section 110(k)(5) of the amended Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In &sect;52.30(c), ``criteria,'' as defined in the proposal, provides: ``The EPA will use the following five criteria,
all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.''
This section is clarified by revising it to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this provision, EPA will consider
a political subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based,
if all five of the following criteria are met.'' Thus, the rule clarifies that all five criteria are to be met, not merely
used by EPA to determine how sanctions will be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In its proposed rule, &sect;52.30(d)(1), EPA provides: ``If all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section
have been met through the action or inaction of the `same' political subdivision, EPA will not impose sanctions on
a statewide basis.'' Although no comments were received from the public on this language, a review by the Agency suggested
that the phrase ``same political subdivision'' may be confusing. By including that language in the rule, EPA was attempting
to indicate that one political subdivision must meet all five of the criteria before EPA's authority to impose sanctions
on a statewide basis would be constrained (see 57 FR 44536). For example, if a State has two nonattainment areas and
a rule, which was past due under the Act, was not yet adopted and submitted to EPA for either area, EPA would look at each
nonattainment area independently to determine whether the five criteria were met. If the first three criteria were
met by one nonattainment area and the last two by the second nonattainment area, then EPA's authority to impose statewide
sanctions would not be constrained. However, if one nonattainment area met all five of the criteria, EPA could not
impose statewide sanctions based on the finding for that area. The EPA is replacing the word same with the word one in
the rule in order to alleviate any confusion. This provision will be implemented in accordance with the interpretation
above.

It is necessary, for clarity's sake, to understand that section 179(a) performs two very distinct functions: it defines
several types of findings, and requires EPA to impose sanctions if one of these findings has been made. Section 179(a)
(1) through (4) sets forth the four types of findings which may lead to the imposition of a sanction. The introduction
and latter part of section 179(a) mandate that at least one sanction must be imposed 18 months after a finding has been
made with respect to certain types of plans if the deficiency is not corrected.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking considers the application of sanctions under section 110(m). However, because section 110(m) and
section 179 are interrelated, the preamble to the proposed rulemaking discussed sanctions under section 179 (a)
and (b) in order to clarify what is required by section 110(m). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific types of sanctions which may be imposed under section 110(m), or must be imposed under section 179(a),
are listed in section 179(b). The two sanctions provided are a highway funding sanction and a 2:1 offset sanction.
These two sanctions are described in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(b) sanctions may be applied pursuant to section 110(m) when the Administrator makes a finding under section
179(a) (1) through (4), provided that the Agency has followed all procedural requirements for imposing a sanction.
The Administrator has no authority under section 110(m), nor any mandatory duty under section 179(a), to impose sanctions
until she has made a finding. The types of findings provided under section 179(a) are discussed in more detail in the
preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(m) may be divided into two distinct parts (see 57 FR 44535). The first part of section 110(m) contains four
distinct elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The timing of the imposition of section 110(m) sanctions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The availability under section 110(m) of the sanctions listed in section 179(b); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The reference to a finding, disapproval, or determination under section 179(a) (1) through (4); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The geographic scope of application of sanctions under section 110(m). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The second part requires the Administrator to propose criteria to be used when considering the application of sanctions
on a statewide basis under section 110(m) within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. Although not central to the
purpose of this rulemaking, EPA presented a detailed discussion of the four elements referred to in the first part
of section 110(m) in the proposed rule. The purpose was to explain how sections 110(m) and 179 provisions are interrelated.
As shall be evident in the ``Response to Comments'' section, the preamble language discussing these four elements
was the basis for numerous comments. The criteria, which are the basis of this action, seemed to generate significantly
fewer comments.

III. Development of Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second sentence of section 110(m) requires the Agency to establish criteria that EPA must apply if the Agency considers
applying sanctions under section 110(m) on a statewide basis within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. These criteria
should enable EPA to determine when a political subdivision,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than the entire State, is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency. Where the political subdivision
is principally responsible, EPA may not impose sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;52.30(a)(1), EPA defines the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
political subdivision
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 as ``*&blank;*&blank;* the representative body that is responsible for adopting and/or implementing air pollution
controls for one, or any combination of one or more of the following: city, town, borough, county, parish, district,
or any other geographical subdivision created by, or pursuant to, Federal or State law. This will include any agency
designated under section 174, 42 U.S.C., section 7504, by the State to carry out the air planning responsibilities
under part D.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA recognizes that an understanding of the term ``principal responsibility'' was integral to the development
of the criteria. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion on how a political subdivision may
be held ``principally responsible'' for a section 179(a) failure when the EPA recognizes that the States have primary
responsibility for meeting the requirements of the Act (see 57 FR 44535&hyph;36). The EPA believes that the criteria
promulgated today will clearly indicate when the political subdivision carries the principal burden of carrying
out an activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is promulgating five criteria (summarized below) that it believes will enable a determination of when a State
has relinquished its primary control over an activity to a political subdivision and the political subdivision has
failed to perform that required activity. The EPA believes that the political subdivision is principally responsible
when the political subdivision: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Has the legal authority to perform the required activity;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If one or more political subdivisions each meet all five of the criteria, EPA will consider those subdivisions principally
responsible, and EPA may impose sanctions only on those political subdivisions and on other areas (short of the entire
State) for which the Agency determines reasonable and appropriate. The EPA would not impose sanctions statewide.
However, if all of the criteria have not been met by at least one political subdivision, EPA will use its discretion
to determine whether to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These five criteria are intended to be applicable to SIP failures relating to stationary, area, and mobile sources.
The EPA believes that the criteria developed here will enable it to successfully determine when a political subdivision
is principally responsible for a deficiency.

IV. Limits of This Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing in the Act precludes EPA from applying sanctions pursuant to section 110(m), without examining the criteria,
if the Agency elects to impose a sanction on a less-than-statewide basis or where EPA imposes statewide sanctions
more than 24 months after a finding. Furthermore, this rulemaking does not affect the situation where each of a group
of political subdivisions, whose combined area comprises the entire State, suffer a deficiency. The EPA could impose
a sanction on each of those political subdivisions as an independent area without applying the criteria, even though
this may appear to be a statewide sanction. All decisions to impose section 110(m) sanctions will be made on a case-by-case
basis, and will be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not intended to identify which sanction EPA will apply in a particular circumstance, nor the type of deficiency
for which EPA might use its discretion to apply sanctions. Furthermore, it is not intended to describe the notice and
comment procedures EPA will ultimately use to impose a sanction pursuant to section 110(m).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this category, the commenters expressed concern with respect to the timing of sanctions and the application

being promulgated, EPA has responded to these comments below.

1. Imposition of Sanctions Earlier Than 18 Months

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Illinois EPA (IEPA) and the Virginia Department of Transportation (DOT) believe section 110(m) does not give
EPA the authority to impose sanctions earlier than 18 months after a finding under section 179. These commenters believe
it is incorrect to impose any sanctions during the 18-month period immediately following a finding because section
179 clearly states that EPA may not impose sanctions if the deficiency is corrected within 18 months. The IEPA believes
Congress included this 18-month period in recognition of the magnitude of the State's responsibilities under the
Act as well as the time involved in the legislative and rulemaking processes. Also, the Illinois DOT states that because
section 179 is the more detailed sanctions provision, under established principles of statutory construction and
interpretation, it must prevail over section 110(m). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IEPA suggests that if EPA determined to impose sanctions earlier than the 18-month period specified in section
179, EPA should develop specific criteria for when these early sanctions will be imposed, and provide notice and opportunity
for potentially affected parties to comment prior to imposing sanctions. The IEPA also indicates that these criteria
are necessary to avoid placing industries that are located in States that meet deadlines in a timely manner at a competitive
disadvantage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(m) provides that the Administrator ``*&blank;*&blank;* may apply any of the sanctions listed in section
179(b) (at any time or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding. *&blank;*&blank;*'' under section 179(a).
This language plainly authorizes sanctions without regard to a waiting period after a finding is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that section 179 is phrased to require sanctions after 18 months not, as the commenters say, to prohibit
sanctions before 18 months. Section 179 states ``for any implementation plan or plan revision required under this
part (or required in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy as described in section 110(k)(5)), if the Administrator
[makes a finding], unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding *&blank;*&blank;*
one of the sanctions referred to in subparagraph (b) shall apply. *&blank;*&blank;*'' This provision mandatorily
imposes sanctions at 18 months if the deficiency has not been corrected, but does not prohibit sanctions earlier.
Because section 179 does not prohibit the earlier application of sanctions, it does not conflict with section 110(m),
which provides that sanctions may be imposed earlier than 18 months. Therefore, there is not a statutory construction
issue of whether section 179 needs to prevail over section 110(m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the request by the IEPA that EPA develop specific criteria for when an early sanction will be imposed, the
EPA does not believe such criteria are statutorily required; however, since EPA will provide the public with an opportunity
to comment on any sanction action under section 110(m) through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to imposition
of the sanctions, the public will have the opportunity to comment on EPA's rationale for the application of sanctions
earlier than 18-months following the finding. Although EPA does not intend to develop specific criteria, Section
A(4) of this preamble provides further discussion on application of sanctions earlier than 18-months following
a finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to IEPA's concern about competitive disadvantage, imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) should benefit
sources located in those areas that make timely submittal of plans and plan revisions. Rather than delaying sanctions
until 18 months after a finding, under section 110(m) sanctions may be applied much earlier than 18 months. Therefore,
delinquent areas may be burdened much sooner than the 18-month period under section 179. Imposition of section 110(m)
sanctions should inhibit any advantage achieved through delayed submittal of required plans and revisions.

2. Application of Sanctions Beyond Nonattainment Areas Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters believe highway sanctions should not be imposed outside of a nonattainment area. The Texas DOT, New
York DOT, Illinois DOT and IEPA are concerned that EPA has not extended the nonattainment limitations of section 179
(a) and (b) to the imposition of sanctions under section 110(m). These commenters indicate that sanctions should
apply only to nonattainment areas. The Virginia DOT believes that section 110(m) sanctions should not extend beyond
a nonattainment area, except in extreme cases (such as where lack of good faith exists) and after a 24-month correction
period has passed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New York DOT and IEPA believe that EPA's position regarding the geographic applicability of offset and highway
sanctions is inconsistent, and that the reasoning that is applied to make the offset sanction applicable to a specific
area should benefit the highway sanction as well. The IEPA feels that section 110(m) refers to the section 179(b) sanctions
without exempting the Administrator from complying with the geographic limitations specified in section 179(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois DOT comments that section 110(m) allows EPA to sanction an area less than a whole nonattainment area if
a unit of local government is really to blame.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New York and Illinois DOT also state that since the statute is clear and understandable on its face, no reference
to legislative history is required or allowed. The Illinois DOT believes that section 110(m) should be viewed in conjunction
with section 179(b)(1), and if Congress had not meant to limit the use of highway funding sanctions to nonattainment
areas, it would not have placed that limitation in section 179(b). The Illinois DOT comments that Congressman Anderson
had prefaced his remarks as expressing the intent of only four members of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee. The commenter noted that in May 1990 the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent out a version of the Amendments
with no limit in section 179(b) on the area for sanctions (see H. Rep. No. 140, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Part 1). The House
Public Works Committee responded with a report of its own at that time amending section 110(m) and repeating almost
the same words quoted by EPA in the proposed rulemaking. Congressman Anderson's words may have been on the point then,
but they did not agree with the language of section 179(b) the way it was finally passed by Congress.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, the Illinois DOT cites the House Conference Committee Report which accompanied the final version of the Act
as evidence that sanctions are to be limited to nonattainment areas [H. Rep. No. 952, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 335&hyph;6;
Cong. Rec. H13101, 13197; Oct. 26, 1990; 1990 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News 3385, 3867&hyph;8 (Discussing imposition
of sanctions ``*&blank;*&blank;* in an area that fails to prepare or implement a plan to attain air quality 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
standards. *&blank;*&blank;*'')].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To address the concerns of all five commenters, EPA believes that section 110(m) and section 179, although interrelated,
do set up two distinct sanctions processes. In general, section 179 provides for mandatory sanctions with respect
to failures under part D (in general, the nonattainment area provisions). As provided in the proposed rule, section
179 focuses on nonattainment areas in several respects (see 57 FR 44536&hyph;37). First, the general introductory
language of section 179(a) provides that sanctions must be imposed for a failure with respect to ``*&blank;*&blank;*
any implementation plan or plan revision required under this 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
part. *&blank;*&blank;*'' The provision is referring to part D of title I, the portion of the Act dealing with nonattainment
area requirements. While some part D requirements may also apply to attainment areas in limited circumstances, the
primary focus of part D is nonattainment areas. Second, the highway sanction language expressly limits the application
of sanctions under section 179(a) to nonattainment areas. Finally, the offset sanction requires new or modified
sources in complying with the requirements of section 173 to increase their offsets to 2:1. Typically, only sources
in nonattainment areas need to comply with section 173 and, therefore, in most instances the offset sanction will
only affect sources in nonattainment areas. For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 179(a) does not require
statewide imposition of sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, section 110(m) clearly provides for the imposition of sanctions beyond nonattainment areas. The
express language of section 110(m) provides that the Administrator may impose sanctions on ``*&blank;*&blank;*
any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
appropriate. *&blank;*&blank;*'' Beyond that, section 110(m) provides for the discretionary imposition of sanctions
for a finding that an area has failed to meet any requirement with respect to any ``plan or plan item'' under the Act.
Such requirements could apply to nonattainment, attainment, or unclassified areas. Although section 110(m) refers
to the sanctions established in section 179(b), there is no language stating that the geographical limitations in
section 179 override section 110(m)'s express authorization for sanctions on any part of the State that EPA determines
reasonable and appropriate. Section 110(m) refers only to the sanctions themselves, not the accompanying limitations.
For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 110(m) does establish its own geographic scope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Virginia DOT suggests that EPA should limit application of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment
area to circumstances where there is a lack of good faith. While EPA may take good faith into consideration in determining
the geographic scope of section 110(m) sanctions, EPA does not agree that it should establish lack of good faith as
a prerequisite for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the comment of Illinois DOT that EPA can sanction less than an entire nonattainment area, the Agency
agrees that under section 110(m)'s broad grant of authority for the imposition of discretionary sanctions, EPA may
select an area smaller than the nonattainment area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IEPA comments that EPA is treating the geographic limitations of the highway and offset sanctions differently
and that EPA should say that highway sanctions are also limited in scope. The EPA disagrees. First, we believe that
both sanctions may be imposed on any portion of the State. However, by its method of application, the offset sanction
will only have effect in those areas that must apply the emission offset requirements of section 173. Therefore, the
offset sanction would have no effect in certain areas. The highway sanction is not self-limiting; therefore, it will
have a broader effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the EPA did not rely on legislative history to override statutory language, but rather to support statutory
language that grants EPA discretion to apply sanctions to other than nonattainment areas. The Illinois DOT bases
its argument that the legislative history does not support the imposition of sanctions beyond the nonattainment
area on an assumption that section 110(m) does not provide an independent grant of authority to impose sanctions.
However, the Act does provide two separate grants of sanction authority with different geographic scopes; this is
supported by the language of the Act, as described above, and by the legislative authority. The language from H. Conf.
Rep. No. 101&hyph;952 that references the imposition of sanctions on an area that fails to attain the air quality standard
appears to refer to the imposition of sanctions under section 179 because it discusses the required imposition of
sanctions. The language cited by EPA in the preamble to the proposed rule addresses a different grant of statutory
authority to impose sanctions, namely, that authority under section 110(m). In addition, Illinois DOT cites H. Rep.
No. 101&hyph;490, which clearly provides that EPA may impose sanctions beyond nonattainment areas by stating that
EPA ``*&blank;*&blank;* is empowered to apply sanctions to any portion of a State.'' The committee goes on to clarify
how it believes EPA should use this broad grant of authority, indicating that EPA should impose sanctions on the governmental
entity that is ``primarily responsible,'' and noting that a State legislature's failure to adopt an inspection/maintenance
program is a circumstance where statewide sanctions are appropriate.

3. Section 110(m) Does Not Establish Independent Authority to Sanction 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Virginia DOT believes section 179 is the basis for imposing sanctions and is not superseded by section 110(m).
Furthermore, the Virginia DOT comments that section 110(m) expands on section 179 by requiring that an additional
minimum 6-month grace period must be observed after the initial 18-month period (i.e., 24 months) before sanctions
may be imposed on a statewide basis where a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.
The City of Chicago comments that EPA's proposed imposition of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) as an alternative
to section 179 would vitiate section 179. Once EPA determines none of the political subdivisions meet the criteria,
and thus the entire State is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency, EPA is bound by the requirements
of section 179.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA agrees that sanctions cannot be imposed statewide within the first 24 months following a finding where a political
subdivision is found principally responsible for the deficiency. However, EPA disagrees that section 179 provides
the sole authority for imposing sanctions and, in doing so, allows for the imposition of statewide sanctions. As discussed
in the response to Comment 2 above, section 179 does not refer to the imposition of statewide sanctions and, in fact,
focuses on the imposition of sanctions in nonattainment areas. In fact, the EPA believes the reference to statewide
sanctions under section 110(m) makes it clear that section 110(m) establishes a different authority to sanction
States and that statewide sanctions are not required under section 179. Section 110(m) provides that statewide sanctions
shall not be applied within 24 months of the time a finding is made if a political subdivision is principally responsible
for the deficiency; this provision means that statewide sanctions may be imposed earlier than 24 months if no political
subdivision is found principally responsible. If section 179 required statewide sanctions after 18 months, it would
be contrary to the section 110(m) provision that sanctions shall not apply within the 24 months following the finding
if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. Therefore, EPA believes that its ability
to impose statewide sanctions during the 24-month period following a finding is based on a determination under section
110(m) that a political subdivision is not principally responsible for the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) does not vitiate section 179 because section 179 sanctions are not statewide but are imposed on the
specific area for which the deficiency arises, in most instances nonattainment areas. As stated previously, section
179 mandates that sanctions be imposed 18 months after a finding is made. While the imposition of sanctions earlier
under section 110(m) could remove the need to impose sanctions under section 179 sanctions in that area, section 179
has continued force and effect in areas where section 110(m) sanctions are not imposed. The EPA does not believe that
imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) conflicts with section 179 sanctions. Application of sanctions earlier
than 18 months is not inconsistent because EPA believes the purpose of section 179 was to ensure that EPA did not delay
sanctions beyond the periods prescribed in that action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) recommends adding a statement to the rule that EPA expects
to impose sanctions on a statewide basis earlier than 18 months only in limited circumstances, after notice-and-comment
rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This statement was not in the proposed rule and EPA believes it should not be included in the final rule. The EPA stated
in the preamble to the proposed rule that it would only apply sanctions early in ``unusual circumstances where the
State has indicated explicit resistance to working to resolve a plan deficiency'' (see 57 FR 44534). The final rule
revises this preamble language because EPA believes the term ``unusual circumstances'' provides little guidance
as to when EPA intended to use its discretionary sanction authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA does not intend to use the section 110(m) authority in all situations where a finding is made, the Agency needs
to ascertain that it has the flexibility to use this option when necessary. In order to develop some plans or plan items,
States must perform certain steps that EPA can track to determine whether the State will meet deadlines in the Act.
When a State believes that EPA can impose sanctions only after a deadline is missed and 18 months have gone by, then there
is little incentive for the State to take the necessary actions to complete authorization and implementation of politically-difficult
rules and regulations. The EPA needs to maintain its flexibility to respond rapidly to situations where it appears
a State will not meet a deadline, and to assure the State that it does not, in fact, have an extended grace period for noncompliance.
The certainty and swiftness of imposition of the Act's penalties are critical to timely completion of the SIP's. Consequently,
the revised language, clarifies EPA's position concerning when discretionary sanctions may be appropriate while
retaining EPA's flexibility to use such sanctions to ensure compliance with the Act. Thus, EPA will exercise section
110(m) sanctions earlier than 18 months only in cases where:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The State has indicated an explicit resistance to resolving a plan or program deficiency or to making a required
plan or program submittal; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Where special circumstances, particular program needs, or time constraints dictate the need for use of such sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the rule retains the Administrator's discretion to apply sanctions at any time after a finding is made; however,
EPA will provide notice and opportunity for comment on the basis for all section 110(m) actions.

 The City of Chicago believes the discretion in &sect;52.30(d)_that if the criteria are met EPA may impose sanctions
on a less than statewide basis to the area it determines is reasonable and appropriate_was not Congress' intent in
enacting section 110(m). The City of Chicago believes EPA's only discretion is whether to apply sanctions to political
subdivisions that meet the criteria. Thus, the City of Chicago believes EPA has no basis to apply sanctions when the
criteria are not met (i.e., to apply sanctions to political subdivisions that were thought to be principally responsible,
but did not meet the criteria, and to any other surrounding political subdivisions EPA determines is reasonable and
appropriate) and that to apply sanctions to these areas is arbitrary and capricious.

Response.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(m) states that sanctions may be applied to any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable
and appropriate, with one exception. If one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible for the deficiency,
sanctions may not be applied statewide. Therefore, if the criteria are met, i.e., a political subdivision is principally
responsible, then EPA may not impose sanctions on a statewide basis. However, if no political subdivision is principally
responsible, the text of section 110(m) expressly authorizes EPA to move forward and impose sanctions on a statewide
basis. The EPA would make a determination, however, concerning what area of the State for which sanctions would be
reasonable and appropriate. Furthermore, EPA is not required to establish criteria to determine the area of the State
for which it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions under section 110(m).

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four commenters, New York DOT, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA), the City of Chicago, and the U.S.
DOT, requested clarification of how EPA will determine the ``reasonable and appropriate'' area to apply sanctions.
The City of Chicago and the U.S. DOT assert that the statute requires such clarification. The New York DOT believes
that the lack of adequate guidance on what area is ``reasonable and appropriate'' will create confusion and continual
uncertainty on the part of States as well as Federal agencies. The New York DOT suggests that the prime consideration
should be whether a good faith effort has been made to bring the nonattainment area into compliance. The New York DOT
believes that if this issue is not addressed in this rulemaking, it should be the subject of another rulemaking.

The OCTA cites the example of California, which consists of several regional authorities, which, in turn, each consist
of several local jurisdictions. The OCTA is concerned about how EPA would impose sanctions in the case where a regional
authority contains several local jurisdictions and where a local authority failed to do everything mandated by a
regional plan. The commenter believes it would be more reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions to the single
local jurisdiction, not the regional authority. In addition to assuring that the State does not suffer sanctions
if one political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency, the commenter suggests that EPA assure
that regions within a State would not be subject to sanctions if one or more local jurisdictions is/are principally
responsible for the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. DOT comments that in situations where a nonattainment area contains multiple political subdivisions, none
of which are principally responsible according to the five criteria, the rule must clarify how EPA will determine
whether to apply sanctions to the specific responsible political subdivision(s) rather than the entire nonattainment
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The City of Chicago and U.S. DOT assert that the statutory mandate to promulgate criteria is not limited to the determination
of principal responsibility. These commenters argue that EPA must also develop criteria to determine when the imposition
of sanctions would be reasonable and appropriate, and the criteria should be sufficient to put potentially affected
political subdivisions on notice of the activities or agreements which may put them at risk of sanctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(m) specifically provides that EPA may impose sanctions on any part of the State that EPA deems is reasonable
and appropriate. Section 110(m) then requires that EPA ``*&blank;*&blank;* establish criteria for exercising
(this) authority *&blank;*&blank;* to ensure that *&blank;*&blank;* such sanctions are not applied on a statewide
basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan are principally responsible
for such deficiency.'' The EPA believes this language strictly limits the required development of criteria to those
necessary to determine if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. There is no requirement
that the criteria must guide EPA's further decision of which area is ``reasonable and appropriate'' for the imposition
of sanctions. At this time, EPA does not have experience with imposing these sanctions and, therefore, does not want
to constrain the Agency in the exercise of this discretion. The variety of circumstances would make it difficult to
develop criteria that would be applicable in every instance. As to the comments of the City of Chicago and the U.S. DOT
that EPA needs to establish criteria for when it will impose sanctions under section 110(m), EPA does not believe that
such criteria are mandated. The public will have an opportunity to comment on EPA's determination of the area on which
it will impose sanctions and the timing of sanctions during each specific section 110(m) rulemaking action.

 The OCTA suggests that the rule clarify that all five criteria are to be met, not merely used, by EPA to determine if a
subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. The OCTA suggests the following language: ``Criteria.
The EPA will use the following five criteria, all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision
is principally responsible for the deficiency.''

 The EPA agrees with this comment but determined that language other than that suggested would be clearer. Therefore,
EPA has revised &sect;52.30(d)(1) to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this action, EPA will consider a political
subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based, if all five
of the following criteria are met.''

 The New York DOT comments that the necessity for all five criteria to be met is overly strict and biased toward imposition
of sanctions statewide, and it may be difficult to establish that all five have been met. Therefore, the New York DOT
suggests that only a majority (three out of five) be met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA believes all five criteria are needed to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible.
The EPA sees no compelling reason to weaken this requirement. In addition, the failure to determine that one or more
areas are principally responsible does not presuppose the imposition of statewide sanctions; the EPA must determine
that the area sanctioned is the reasonable and appropriate area.

 The U.S. DOT requests clarification of what State actions are necessary to provide adequate legal authority under
the proposed Criterion 1. Criterion 1 states that the State must provide adequate legal authority to a political subdivision
to perform the required activity.

 The EPA does not believe that there is a single distinct definition of the term ``legal authority.'' What constitutes
adequate legal authority may vary from State to State. This should be handled on a case-by-case basis.

The New York DOT comments that under the proposed Criterion 2 [&sect;52.30(c)(2)], there must be a very clear agreement
in the SIP or some other document as to which functions are to be performed by which agencies. For example, functions
traditionally performed by local agencies may not be performed that way under the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA agrees with the commenter and encourages States to develop clear agreements as to which functions are being
performed by which agencies. Note in particular that section 174 of the Act requires States to jointly review and update,
as necessary, their planning procedures that were in effect before the Act was amended in 1990 or to develop new procedures
as appropriate. In preparing such procedures, State and local elected officials must determine which elements of
a revised SIP will be developed, adopted, and implemented by the State, and which elements will be carried out by local
or regional entities. The EPA has provided guidance on this and other section 174 requirements in a document entitled
``1992 Transportation and Air Quality Planning Guidelines'' (July 1992, EPA 420/R&hyph;92&hyph;001). The EPA
will work with the State and the political subdivision to ascertain if this criterion has been met. In addition, any
comments raised as to this issue during the rulemaking process on a specific section 110(m) action will be properly
considered by EPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Concerning Criterion 4 [&sect;52.30(c)(4)], the U.S. DOT also comments there should be a provision included to provide
against ``State failure.'' If a local agency cancels an agreement to perform a certain function, it might leave the
State without the time or resources to perform the function. Thus, the State, instead of the local agency, would become
principally responsible. The U.S. DOT believes it would be inappropriate to apply statewide sanctions in such a case.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the local agency cancels its agreement to perform a function, EPA would take this into consideration when determining
whether the political subdivision is principally responsible in causing the deficiency. Moreover, this factor
may be considered in determining the area to which it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions. The EPA can
consider all factors in determining what area is reasonable and appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Massachusetts DOT believes the rule should contain a specific provision for State consultation in determining
principal responsibility because many factors such as regional demographic trends, changing local traffic patterns,
and land-use decisions in adjoining areas have a larger impact on emissions than institutional arrangements for
air quality planning. The proposed criteria may be the best way to evaluate whether the State or the political subdivision
is solely responsible for the emissions requirements, but it may not be relevant in targeting the actual source of
the problem or in defining solutions.

 To the extent it determines appropriate, EPA will consult with the State when evaluating the criteria under section
110(m). In any event, the State will have adequate opportunity to raise any such concerns in the comment period following
the notice of proposed rulemaking for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions.

 The State of Vermont comments that it is the only State in attainment with the ozone national ambient air quality standards
and also located within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. Vermont requests clarification in the rule of whether
attainment status or inclusion in the ozone transport region (OTR) is the deciding factor with respect to applicability
of these rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Neither attainment status nor inclusion in the OTR is the deciding factor. Under section 110(m), EPA may impose sanctions
on a statewide basis or on any area of the State deemed reasonable and appropriate based on the failure of the State or
a political subdivision of the State to meet a requirement of the Act with respect to a plan or plan element. If a requirement
is applicable to a political subdivision of the State, EPA will determine whether that political subdivision was
principally responsible for the failure, using the criteria established in this rulemaking. The EPA's ability to
use the section 110(m) sanctions is not limited to nonattainment areas or areas that must meet the title I, part D nonattainment
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The City of Chicago comments that the term ``required activity'' contravenes the definition of required activity
in section 179 and permits EPA to sanction entities without providing any prior notice that EPA considers a particular
action to be sanctionable. The City of Chicago also comments that since section 110(m) incorporates section 179(a),
EPA is not permitted to create a second, conflicting definition. Furthermore, the proposed definition does not identify
covered activities, and it does not give entities prior notice of sanctionable activities. Finally, the City of Chicago
is concerned about the ambiguity of the definition and that it may mean EPA is expanding the definition from section
179(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 179(a) does not define required activity. Rather, EPA believes this introductory phrase under section 179(a)
refers to submittals required under part D of the Act. The four general categories of activities listed in section
179(a) are the four possible types of State failure with respect to the required activities under part D. The types
of failure are not synonymous with required activities under the introductory language of section 179(a). Finally,
the City of Chicago contends that the definition of ``required activity'' is too open-ended because of the language
``may include, but is not limited to.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA interprets the term ``required activity'' for purposes of section 110(m) in a manner similar to that for section
179(a); however, EPA recognizes that for section 110(m), ``required activity'' refers to any plan or plan item requirement
under the Act, not just those required under part D. Finally, EPA agrees that the language ``may include, but is not
limited to'' may provide broader authority than that granted under section 110(m). Therefore, EPA has changed the
definition in the final rule to provide: ``The term `required activity' refers to the submission of a plan or plan item
or the implementation of a plan or plan item under the Clean Air Act.''

 The OCTA and the U.S. DOT request clarification of the term ``political subdivision.'' Both commenters appear concerned
about whether EPA in making a determination of ``principal responsibility'' may consider less than the entire nonattainment
area. The OCTA notes that California has several regional authorities that each are composed of numerous local jurisdictions.
These local jurisdictions often have the responsibility for ``adopting and implementing air pollution controls.''

 The definition of ``political subdivision'' set forth in &sect;52.30(a)(1) includes all types of governmental
entities, including local jurisdictions. The EPA could sanction less than an entire nonattainment area based on
a determination that a local jurisdiction was principally responsible for the deficiency on which the sanction is
based.

 The OCTA comments that the proposed rule should include a definition of ``plan item.'' The OCTA notes that section
110(m) reads in part ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;in relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by the
Administrator). *&blank;*&blank;*'' The OCTA cites the example of the California SIP, which is partially composed
of regional plans. Some regional plans require local jurisdictions to take certain actions, which to the commenter
appear to be plan items.

 As discussed earlier, to make this clearer, EPA replaces the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' under &sect;52.30(a)(2)
with the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' Although EPA interpreted the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' to essentially
mean the same as the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' this replacement is more consistent with the language of section
110(m) which refers to ``plan or plan item.'' ``Plan and plan item'' are also defined under &sect;52.30(a)(4).

 The Texas DOT, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission
(NIRPC) asked EPA to identify which sanction will be applied for various types of SIP deficiencies. These commenters
all state that the sanction should be tied to the underlying deficiency. For example, the commenters state that highway
sanctions should only be applied when there is a SIP deficiency relative to mobile sources and the offset sanction
where the deficiency is relative to stationary sources. The CMA recommends adding extra language to the rule as follows:
``The EPA will assess the nature of the deficiencies and take this into account when determining which sanction to
apply.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIRPC further asserts that only those projects which have the potential for increasing emissions should be targeted;
withholding highway funds which may correct a problem is inappropriate.

 The type of sanction to be applied and the selection procedure are not part of this rulemaking. Sanction determinations

of sanctions under section 110(m). The notice will propose for comment which sanctions or sanction will be applied.
In addition, the Act sets forth those projects exempted from the highway funding restrictions. The EPA will act consistently

The Massachusetts DOT comments that EPA's authority to sanction a State if ``*&blank;*&blank;* a requirement of
an approved plan is not being implemented is too broad, given the large number of agencies, regulatory authorities,
and group interests which can prevent a planned project from being implemented.'' Instead, a State's good faith effort

The types of findings that may lead to the imposition of sanctions are specified in the Act; they are not being developed
by this rulemaking. Therefore, once a finding of failure to implement a plan has been made, section 179(a) requires
that the 18-month mandatory sanctions clock begins. Furthermore, any finding made under section 179(a) provides
EPA with discretion to impose sanctions under section 110(m).

``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity,

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C 605(b), the Administrator hereby certifies that the attached rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since the rule requires EPA to consider criteria
before applying sanctions on a statewide basis, it potentially could result in a reduced burden on small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this provision, EPA will consider a political subdivision to be principally responsible for the
deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based, if all five of the following criteria are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State has provided adequate legal authority to a political subdivision to perform the required activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

subdivision, EPA will not impose sanctions on a statewide basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If not all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section have been met through the action or inaction of one political

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 25, 1993 EPA published the notices of proposed rulemaking to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revisions submitted by the States of North Dakota and Utah for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM) in each State. The implementation
plans were submitted by the States to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to
ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply
with the CAA. The rationale for the approval was set forth in the proposals. No comments were received pursuant to these
proposed actions. Therefore, EPA is proceeding with its approval of the revisions to the North Dakota and Utah SIPs
for establishing a PROGRAM in each State.

I. Background of Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision
to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States of North Dakota and Utah submitted SIP revisions to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507
of the CAA. In order to gain full approval, the State's submittals must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses required by section 507(a); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process which is required by section 507(a)(3); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP
required by section 507(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Submittals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of North Dakota has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements
all required PROGRAM elements. N.D.C.C. sections 23&hyph;25&hyph;02 and 23&hyph;25&hyph;03 grants the Department
the authority to undertake the elements of the PROGRAM. The Governor, through Executive Order 1992&hyph;5, established
the Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel. The North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories
(the Department) formally adopted the SIP revision on October 23, 1992, which identifies a plan to implement the PROGRAM.
This SIP revision is being added to the North Dakota SIP as section 12. The North Dakota PROGRAM was submitted to EPA
by the Governor of North Dakota on November 2, 1992, and was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness.
In a letter dated December 15, 1992, EPA requested additional information from the State in order to make a positive
determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information on January 18, 1993, EPA notified the
State in a letter dated February 2, 1993, that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. The submittal
then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its SIP revision section 12.5 to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State has met the second PROGRAM element
by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office of the Chief of the Environmental Health Section
effective April 6, 1992, as stated in its SIP revision section 12.3. The State has met the third PROGRAM element through
Executive Order 1992&hyph;5 dated May 21, 1992, issued by the Governor of North Dakota, which established a Small
Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of North Dakota, and by outlining in its SIP revision section 12.4
the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e). Additionally,
the State of North Dakota has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
CAA. This mechanism is contained in section 12.2 of the State's SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Utah has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required
PROGRAM elements. Section 19&hyph;2&hyph;109.2 of the Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended authorizes the Utah
Air Quality Board to establish a SBAP, and create a Compliance Advisory Panel. A new section 17, which is a plan for implementation
of the SBAP, will be added to the Utah SIP. R307&hyph;2 of the Utah Air Conservation Rules incorporates this SIP revision
by reference. The Utah PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Utah on November 9, 1992, with supplemental information
sent on November 5, 1992, and January 11, 1993. EPA notified the State in a letter dated December 30, 1992, that the submittal
was administratively and technically complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received
a concurrence from all reviewers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Utah has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in section 17.3 of its regulations to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) of the CAA for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State of Utah has met the second
PROGRAM element by locating the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of the Executive Director, as stated in section 17.5.1 of its regulations. The State of Utah has met the third
PROGRAM element by outlining in sections 17.4.1 and 2 of its regulations the functions of the CAP and how the members
will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e) of the CAA. Additionally, the State of Utah has established
a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation
of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA. This mechanism is contained in section
17.2 of the State's regulations.

III. Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the SIP revisions submitted by the States of North Dakota and Utah. The revisions were made to satisfy
the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, EPA is approving two State programs created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. These programs do not impose any new regulatory burdens on
small businesses; they are programs under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided
by the States. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

The Governor of Utah submitted on November 9, 1992 a plan to develop and implement a Small Business Assistance Program
to meet the requirements of section 507 of the Clean Air Act by November 15, 1994. The plan commits to provide technical
and compliance assistance to small businesses, hire an Ombudsman to serve as an independent advocate for small businesses,
and establish a Compliance Advisory Panel to advise the program and report to EPA on the program's effectiveness.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) amends several existing rules that govern procedures for hearings and appeals
under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 in order to bring the rules up to date. Because of events
that have occurred since they were adopted, the existing rules omit references or contain incorrect references,
are inconsistent with other rules, or fail to provide necessary information or procedures. The amendments correct
these defects. In this document OHA also updates telephone numbers of offices of field solicitors and field offices
of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), listed in the existing rules, to reflect changes
which have been effected heretofore.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 19, 1991, OHA proposed amendments to existing procedural rules governing hearings and appeals under
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988), because rules subsequently adopted or cases decided have rendered the existing rules out of date or shown
them to be incomplete or inaccurate. See 56 FR 58330&hyph;58332 (Nov. 19, 1991). No comments were received on the published
proposed amendments. The amendments effected by this final rulemaking are explained below under the heading for
each rule involved.

Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1100
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of previous amendments of 43 CFR 4.1109(a) to provide current addresses and jurisdictions of field solicitors
who are to be served documents (see 56 FR 2139, 2142&hyph;43 (Jan. 22, 1991), 56 FR 5061 (Feb. 7, 1991)), the definition
of ``field solicitor'' in 43 CFR 4.1100(d) is superfluous. It was proposed to remove that definition and redesignate
the following definitions in alphabetical order. No comments were received on this proposal. That definition is
therefore removed and the following definitions (e) and (f) are redesignated (d) and (e).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30 CFR 842.15(d) provides a right of appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or the Board) under 43 CFR 4.1280

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the written determination, after informal review by the Director of the OSM or his or her designee, concerning the
decision of an authorized representative of the Secretary not to inspect or take enforcement action concerning an
alleged violation that is the subject of a request for a federal inspection under 30 CFR 842.12.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, 30 CFR 843.12(i) provides that any determination by an authorized representative of the Secretary granting
or denying an abatement period exceeding 90 days under 30 CFR 842.12(h) shall contain a right of appeal to IBLA under
1280 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the Board has had occasion to observe, however, 43 CFR 4.1105 does not name the permittee of the operation that is
the subject of a determination of the Director or an authorized representative, or any person whose interests might
be adversely affected by the outcome on appeal and who participated before OSM, as a party who must be served with a copy
of the notice of appeal and statement of reasons under 43 CFR 4.1283(a) and who may participate under &sect;&sect;4.1284
and 4.1286. See Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc., 108 IBLA 70, 83 n.7, 96 I.D. 139, 146 n.7 (1989). OHA therefore
proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1105(a) by adding subsection (5) naming such permittees and persons as parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After this addition to 43 CFR 4.1105(a) was proposed, however, the Board decided Robert L. Clewell, 123 IBLA 253 (1992).
In that case, citizens who had requested their identity be kept confidential, in accordance with 30 CFR 842.12(b),
later revealed their identity to the coal company whose operation they had requested be inspected by sending a copy
of their statement of reasons of appealing the denial of their request for inspection to the company. Had they not done
so, under the terms of &sect;842.12(b), their ``identity may not be revealed, even to other parties to a case, unless
and until a competent official acting in response to a formal request filed under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) or other Federal
law has determined that [their] identity must be made public because it does not fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)
(1988) or any other exemption from disclosure provided by law. See 42 FR 62665&hyph;66 (Dec. 13, 1977).'' Robert L.
Clewell,

 at 257 n.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this decision, OHA has added a statement to the new &sect;4.1105(a)(5) that a person who wishes his or
her identity kept confidential under 30 CFR 842.12(b) is responsible for maintaining that confidentiality when
serving documents in accordance with &sect;4.1109.

OSM amended 30 CFR 723.19(a) and 845.19(a) to provide 30 days rather than 15 days in which a person may file a petition
for review of a proposed civil penalty with the Hearings Division of OHA after the date of service of notice of an assessment
conference officer's action. See 56 FR 10060, 10063 (Mar. 8, 1991). OHA therefore proposed to amend the corresponding
procedural rule, 43 CFR 4.1151(b), to provide the same time and to add a reference to 30 CFR 845.18. No comments were
received on the proposed change, so it is adopted.

The references to 30 CFR part 723 in 43 CFR 4.1152(a)(2); to 30 CFR 723.15 in 43 CFR 4.1154(a); and to 30 CFR 723.12 and
723.13 in 43 CFR 4.1157 (a) and (b) need to be updated by correcting the references in 43 CFR 4.1154(a) and in 43 CFR 4.1157
(a) and (b) and by adding references to the corresponding sections in 30 CFR part 845. OHA proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1152,

Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1271(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When 43 CFR part 4, subpart L was originally promulgated in 1978, 43 CFR 4.1271(a) provided that an aggrieved party
could file a ``notice of appeal'' from an order or decision of an administrative law judge disposing of a proceeding
``under this subpart, except a civil penalty proceeding under &sect;4.1150.'' This is still the language of the rule.
Since 1978, however, other rules have been added to subpart L that provide for a ``petition for discretionary review,''
rather than a notice of appeal, as the document to file with IBLA when seeking review of the initial decision of an administrative
law judge. See 43 CFR 4.1309, 4.1369 (56 FR 2139, 2144, Jan. 22, 1991; 56 FR 5061, Feb. 7, 1991). OHA has also proposed
rules that provide for petitions for discretionary review. See 43 CFR 4.1377, 4.1387 (56 FR 45806, Sept. 6, 1991).
Further, special procedures for seeking IBLA review exist for other proceedings in subpart L. See 43 CFR 4.1187, 4.1196,
4.1391.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is possible for IBLA to clarify by decision which avenue of appeal is appropriate for each proceeding,
see

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 107 IBLA 329 (1989), it is preferable for the procedural rules themselves to contain this information. OHA therefore
proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1271(a) so that the rule will specify for which proceedings a notice of appeal is appropriate.
No comments on the proposed change were received, so it is adopted. Proceedings not covered by the procedural rules
set forth in the revised &sect;4.1271(a) contain special provisions for seeking review of initial decisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amended Rule retains the Rule's primary itemization, price and other disclosure requirements, without major,
substantive modification; expressly prohibits non-declinable fees (such as so-called ``casket handling fees''
or ``basic facilities fees'') charged in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic services of funeral director
and staff; deletes the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement, but retains the obligation to give price and
other information to consumers who request it over the telephone; and contains a series of changes to the original
Rule in the nature of fine-tuning and technical revisions designed to make the Rule more effective and to facilitate
compliance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview of the Original Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission promulgated the original Rule on September 24, 1982, making it fully effective on April 30, 1984.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission's decision to promulgate the Rule was appealed, and was subsequently affirmed in Harry &amp; Bryant
Co. v.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 FTC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Funeral Rule declares it an unfair or deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to: (1) fail to furnish price
information to funeral consumers; (2) require consumers to purchase items they do not desire to buy; and (3) embalm
deceased human remains for a fee without authorization. The Rule further declares it a deceptive practice for funeral
providers to misrepresent: (1) the necessity for embalming, caskets for cremation, and grave vaults or grave liners;
(2) legal and cemetery requirements; (3) preservation and protection capabilities of funeral goods and services;
and (4) cash advance charges for items arranged for by the funeral provider on the consumer's behalf.

 The Rule had two effective dates. Those portions of the Rule that prohibit certain oral or written representations
became effective on January 1, 1984. 48 FR 45537 (Oct. 6, 1983). The remainder of the Rule_the portions imposing affirmative
obligations on funeral providers_became effective on April 30, 1984. Id. The effective date of &sect;453.3(b)(1)(ii)
of the Rule was changed from January 1, 1984 to April 30, 1984. 49 FR 564 (Jan. 5, 1984).

 726 F.2d 993 (4th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 820 (1984). The Court held that the Funeral Rule did not, as alleged,
exceed the Commission's authority under &sect;&sect;5 and 18 of the FTC Act and did not violate funeral directors'
First Amendment rights of commercial free speech.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent those practices and to correct consumers' misimpressions, the Rule contains several remedial requirements.
The Rule requires that funeral providers: (1) Disclose written price information by means of a General Price List
(``GPL''), Casket Price List (``CPL''), and an outer burial container price list (``OBC&hyph;PL'') to persons who
inquire in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;&sect;453.2(b)(2)-(4));
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (2) Give purchasers a written statement, after they have selected funeral goods and services, containing the prices
for each of the items selected, the total price for the funeral arrangements selected, price estimates or actual costs,
if known, for cash advance items, and any legal, cemetery or crematory requirements that compel the purchase of any
items or services for the particular funeral (&sect;453.2(b)(5)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rule permits providers to incorporate the information from the casket and outer burial container price lists
in the general price list. This combined list also must be offered to persons who inquire in person about funeral arrangements
or the prices of funeral goods and services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Affirmatively disclose to telephone callers who inquire about funeral ``terms, prices or conditions'' that
price information is available over the telephone (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(i));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disclose specific price information over the telephone to persons who call and request it (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(ii));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Make truthful representations about legal and other requirements that compel the purchase of particular items
or services (&sect;453.3)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Allow consumers to select and purchase only those goods and services they desire (rather than offering goods and
services only in predetermined packages) (&sect;453.4(b));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Seek express approval before embalming the deceased for a fee (&sect;453.5)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Make truthful representations about the preservative and protective value of funeral goods and services (&sect;453.3(e));

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Disclose that they charge a fee for obtaining cash advance items, if that is the case (&sect;453.3(f)); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Make unfinished wood boxes or alternative containers available for direct cremation, if the provider offers
direct cremation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;453.4(a)(2)).

The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose stated that the essential purpose of the Rule is to lower barriers
to price competition in the funeral market and facilitate informed consumer choice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rule thus seeks to ensure that consumers have access to sufficient information to permit informed purchase decisions,
that consumers are not required to purchase items they do not want and are not required by law to purchase, and that misrepresentations
are not used to influence consumer purchase decisions.

Rule.

B. The Amended Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in promulgating the amended Rule, seeks to increase the Rule's potential benefits to consumers by
clarifying its requirements and reducing actual or potential compliance burdens on the funeral industry. Such action
should increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosure and other obligations.
Based on the record in this proceeding, the Commission has concluded that the low levels of industry compliance with,
and consumer awareness of, the Rule do not permit a full cost-benefit analysis of its impact, because the analysis
does not capture the full effects of the Rule had there been greater compliance. Despite this finding, the Commission
has determined from the record evidence that the Rule is providing pro-competitive and informational benefits to
consumers that outweigh its costs to providers, and that those benefits, but not costs, are likely to increase over
time as Rule compliance and consumer awareness of their rights under the Rule increase. The Commission has further
concluded that the record in this proceeding does not contain a sufficient basis to overturn the Rule's presumptive
validity as a legally promulgated rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has concluded, however, that clarifying amendments to the price disclosure and ``unbundling'' provisions
of the Rule are necessary to clarify that it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice to impose non-declinable fees
in addition to the one for ``basic services of funeral director and staff,'' permitted under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).
These amendments effectively eliminate the imposition of so-called ``casket handling fees'' as separate non-declinable
fees charged to consumers who purchase caskets from non-funeral home sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has determined that these fees serve to frustrate the Rule's basic ``unbundling'' requirement by
penalizing consumers who decline caskets sold by the funeral home and instead purchase them from third party sellers.
The emergence of third-party casket sellers, and consequently, those fees, have developed in the market since the
Rule's promulgation.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent that these fees include a charge for provider overhead that is not allocated to other items offered for
sale, the amended Rule does not prohibit their inclusion in the non-declinable services fee permitted under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission further has concluded that repeal of the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(i))
is warranted because its costs outweigh its actual and potential benefits. The record evidence indicates that the
affirmative telephone disclosure is an inartful and unnecessary signal to consumers about the availability of price
information. The Commission has determined that the Rule's other price disclosure provisions are adequate, and
that this provision is unlikely to provide substantial additional benefits to consumers. Record evidence indicates
that the Rule is contributing now to increased consumer ``price-sensitivity'' that results in some consumer shopping
for lower-cost providers and services. Consumers who call to first arrange a date and time for a funeral service, however,
or who request the removal of remains, likely expect an empathetic response, and may be seriously offended by the uninvited
offer to discuss prices. Some consumers in that circumstance are likely to interpret the affirmative disclosure
as an indication of an unwarranted provider concern with the consumer's ability to afford services. The provision's
likely inability to benefit consumers does not justify the imposition of such undue awkwardness and potential offense
in what is otherwise an extremely delicate business, social and personal transaction. The Commission has concluded
that the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retention of the requirement
to provide price and other readily-available information over the telephone on request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission further has adopted a variety of minor, ``fine-tuning'' amendments in light of the evidence on industry
compliance. Those amendments are designed to clarify the Rule's requirements and reduce actual or potential compliance
burdens in order to increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosures. Those
amendments, which do not alter providers' basic obligations or consumers' rights under the Rule, concern the timing
of giving the general price list and other disclosure requirements, the casket and outer burial container price list
disclosures, and the general ``unbundling'' provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission has adopted several technical Rule amendments that are necessary to correct inconsistencies
or unnecessary language in certain Rule provisions, or to complement other recommended amendments.

Little, if any, systematic or otherwise reliable evidence in the record documents industry-wide deceptive or unfair
practices concerning Rule-related issues by cemeteries, crematories that do not sell funeral goods, or other sellers
of funeral goods or funeral services not presently subject to the Rule. Therefore, the Commission has declined to
expand the Rule to cover such entities, as recommended by some rulemaking participants. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR)
at 109&hyph;121 for a full discussion of the evidence on this issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission's Findings in 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission required this unique review to determine, at an early date: (1) Whether the Rule is operating as expected
in reducing barriers to price competition and increasing informed consumer choice, or whether some modification
is necessary to facilitate those benefits; and (2) whether there is a need to continue the Rule after it has had an opportunity
to work in the marketplace; termination would be considered if increased competition has largely corrected the problems
addressed by the Rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission determined, however, that the Rule's effects on the funeral market may be evidenced more slowly than
in other industries due to factors it found unique to the funeral transaction.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 One of those factors was that many consumers would not have exposure to the Rule-required price lists and other provisions
for many years because purchases of funerals are infrequent. Unlike other situations, consumers also are unusually
susceptible to influence from the funeral director's advice because of the unique combination of emotional stress,
lack of experience and information, and tight time constraints. The Commission predicted as a result that the initial
stimulus for price competition would likely come from existing or new providers that begin to advertise and otherwise
compete on the basis of price. The Commission concluded that it could not say how quickly the Rule's competitive impact
would begin to be felt in light of traditional industry constraints on price competition and barriers to entry.

The Commission nonetheless predicted that the Rule could provide economic benefits for consumers in various ways.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Should greater price competition emerge, for example, the Rule could reduce or hold stable actual prices and overall
consumer expenditures for funerals. This would most likely result from increased consumer price-sensitivity,
which might lead some consumers to shift from higher to lower-priced providers. Expenditures could also be reduced
as consumers decline items previously required in packaged funerals, and as unfair or deceptive acts or practices
that induced consumer purchases decline. Finally, the Commission determined that mandatory price itemization
was warranted even if some consumers knowingly chose to buy more goods and services than they would have under package-only
pricing. The purpose of the Rule is to enhance consumer choice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finally determined that, while competition induced by the Rule could reduce price levels, mandatory
itemization presented opportunities for providers to voluntarily raise prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Providers could choose to raise itemized prices or the price for the lowest-priced funeral, for example, in order
to increase profits or account for increased consumer declinations of certain items. The Commission reasoned, however,
that itemization does not require those results because it does not preclude traditional industry pricing methods,
such as package pricing and ``graduated recovery'' of proportionately more overhead from higher-priced funerals.
The Commission further concluded that providers may not be able to raise prices simply to recoup lost revenue or increase
profits as price competition increases under the Rule.

2. The Mandatory Review Proceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission on December 9, 1987 published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (hereafter ``ANPR'') describing
the planned review of the Funeral Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ANPR notified the public that the Commission intended to conduct the rulemaking, and solicited public comments
on many of the key Rule-related issues. The ANPR contained 44 questions concerning consumer and funeral provider
experiences, the scope of the Rule, compliance, various Rule provisions, regulatory flexibility and the paperwork
burden imposed by the Rule. The majority of the commenters
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recommended retention of the Rule. Funeral director trade groups recommended repeal or, in the alternative, substantial
modification and expansion of the Rule to cover other sellers, such as cemeteries.

 The Commission in the NPR established a schedule for three public hearings to be held in Washington, Chicago, and San
Francisco, and requested comment on a number of questions set out in the notice. In all, 189 individuals and groups
submitted written comments, including two funeral directors, five cemetery/crematory/third-party casket seller
groups or individuals, six funeral director trade associations, 147 consumers, 27 consumer/memorial society groups,
one federal official and one state group.

Based on requests from interested parties who wished to question witnesses at the public hearings, the Presiding
Officer designated four groups for that purpose: (1) The Consumer Interest Group, including the American Association
of Retired Persons and the Continental Association of Funeral and Memorial Societies; (2) the Funeral Director Group,
including the National Funeral Directors Association and the National Selected Morticians (that group also included
William Pierson, the owner of the Hursen Funeral Home, the Illinois Funeral Directors Association, and the Conference
of Funeral Service Examining Boards; (3) the Crematory and Prearrangement Group, including the Cremation Association
of North America and the Pre-Arrangement Association of America; and (4) the Special Cemetery Group, including the
American Cemetery Association. The Presiding Officer established the last group for the limited purpose of conducting
examination on whether the Rule should be expanded to include cemeteries. See R&hyph;A&hyph;37.

In April 1989, Rebuttal Submissions were filed by the staff, the Cremation Association of North America (``CANA''),
the Monument Builders of North America (``MBNA''), the National Funeral Directors Association (``NFDA'') and National
Selected Morticians (``NSM'') (joint rebuttal), the American Cemetery Association (``ACA''), the American Association
of Retired Persons (``AARP'') and the Pre-Arrangement Association of America (``PAA''). In response to a request
from the Presiding Officer, those groups other than the staff also filed Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
Law and Recommended Decision in May 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to all of the testimonial and written information just described, the record contains three national
surveys of actual funeral arrangers, conducted in 1981, 1987 and 1988. The 1981 Baseline Study (or ``BLS'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was conceived as a benchmark for later comparison with the 1987 Replication Study (or ``RS'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conducted for the Commission, these studies examined: (1) Consumer purchasing behavior and expenditures for funerals;
(2) consumer knowledge of the funeral market; and (3) industry practices and prices. By comparing the results of the
two studies, inferences could be drawn about the Funeral Rule's impact on the funeral market. The Bureau of Economics
Report of February 1989
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contains that comparative analysis. The Gallup Organization conducted the third, and most recent, study of funeral
arrangers for the AARP.

 Viewed together, those three empirical surveys represent the most reliable and comprehensive systematic data available
on consumer experiences under the Rule in shopping for and choosing funeral goods and services, and of industry Rule
compliance.

With respect to the BLS, however, the 1982 rulemaking staff concluded from its review of a telephone validation study
that the BLS data were subject to qualification and differing interpretation in four specific areas where the data
appeared to conflict with evidence already on the original record_consumers' receipt of telephone price information,
written itemized price information and itemized statements, and requests for permission to embalm. See R&hyph;B&hyph;70
(Memorandum from Funeral Rule Staff to Commission, ``Impact Evaluation Survey, Funeral TRR,'' July 15, 1982). The
Commission in its comparative analysis of the Baseline and Replication study data does not rely on the Baseline data
in those four areas.

In addition to these empirical studies, statistical data and testimony presented by Mr. Wendell Hahn of the Federated
Funeral Directors of America (hereafter ``FFDA''), an independent firm that provides financial and business consulting
services to some 1,500 independent funeral homes in 30 states, representing about 10% of all funerals per year, afforded
evidence on changes in funeral home costs of operation and prices under the Rule. A 1988 national survey of 500 funeral
directors presented by the AARP provided similar evidence.

members regarding changes in provider practices under the Rule. The record further contains two national opinion
surveys concerning consumers' views about, and knowledge of, various Rule requirements, and five other surveys
of cemeterians, cremationists, monument builders and memorial societies conducted by interested groups on specific,
Rule-related issues.

The rulemaking staff and Presiding Officer published their respective Reports in June and July 1990, summarizing
the record evidence and recommending, with minor differences, retention of the Rule, repeal of the affirmative telephone
disclosure, prohibition of separate non-declinable fees, in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic services
of funeral director and staff, such as so-called ``casket handling fees,'' and the adoption of several ``fine-tuning''
amendments.

The Office of the Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection, favored a limited review by the Bureau of the amended Rule
to measure its impact, in particular the prohibition of ``casket handling fees.'' See Memorandum from Gerald Caplan,
Deputy Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection, to the Commission, June 20, 1991 at 5. The Bureau of Economics recommended
the inclusion of a future and final mandatory review of the Rule under the rulemaking procedures of section 18 of the
FTC Act. See Memorandum from Peter Vander Nat, Bureau of Economics, to the Commission, August 26, 1991 at 3. The Commission
has not adopted either recommendation, but has scheduled the Funeral Rule for a mandatory ``notice and comment''
review in 1999, in accordance with its ten-year review schedule adopted for all Commission rules and guides. See 58
FR 11554 (Feb. 25, 1992).

On November 21, 1991, representatives of the NFDA, NSM, AARP, CANA, ACA, MBNA and PAA made oral presentations to the
Commission concerning this review proceeding. On January 28, 1993, after reviewing the rulemaking record as a whole,
the Commission voted unanimously to retain and amend the Rule, incorporating all of the substantive changes recommended
by the rulemaking staff and the Bureau of Economics.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Legal Standard for Amending the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 18(d)(2)(B) of the FTC Act states that ``[a] substantive amendment to, or repeal of, a rule promulgated under
subsection (a)(1)(B) shall be prescribed, and subject to judicial review, in the same manner as a rule prescribed
under such subsection.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, the standard of judicial review for amendment to, or repeal of, a section 18 rule is identical to that for any rule
prescribed pursuant to section 18. Upon judicial review, a section 18 rule may be set aside if it is ``arbitrary, capricious''
or otherwise not in accordance with law upon any of the grounds set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
at 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)&hyph;(D), or if the factual determinations upon which the rule is based are not supported by
``substantial evidence'' in the rulemaking record as a whole.

In their Proposed Findings, funeral director groups assert

that the current rulemaking is subject to the same standards and procedures as a de novo rulemaking. Therefore, they
appear to contend that the Commission must support any decision, including the retention of the Funeral Rule, on a

R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 213&hyph;214. The NFDA/NSM further suggest that any change in the Rule's requirements
(other than repeal) must be based on new evidence that current practices are unfair or deceptive, in accordance with
the Commission's regulatory authority. Id. at 220&hyph;221. The amended Rule, however, except as noted, covers
no other new acts, practices, or sellers of funeral goods or services. Moreover, the Commission concludes that the
NFDA/NSM position is inaccurate. The Commission when it promulgated the Rule determined that the covered practices
were unfair or deceptive, as the Rule states. The Rule, however, also contains many ``preventive requirements''
designed to remedy those practices. Those preventive requirements may be modified without an entirely new record,
as discussed in the accompanying text. As the Commission stated in mandating this review, one of its purposes was to
determine whether the Rule is operating as expected in reducing barriers to price competition and increasing consumer
choice, or whether some modification is necessary to facilitate those benefits. R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (SBP) at 42299.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This view is incorrect. A decision to retain any portion of the current Rule may be based upon evidence gathered during
the original rulemaking and the Commission's subsequent enforcement experience, as well as evidence adduced during
the current rulemaking. Indeed, to the extent that nothing supplements evidence from the initial rulemaking, there
is a presumption that the existing rule should be retained.

As discussed elsewhere in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, the Commission has evaluated the relative costs and
benefits of the Rule, industry compliance, the Rule's effect on competition and consumer awareness, and a number
of other factors, to determine whether to retain, amend, or repeal the Rule. In making that determination, the Commission
has taken into account, among other things, the comments received in this rulemaking as well as the record established
in the original rulemaking proceeding and the Commission's experience in enforcing the existing Rule. The Commission
believes that its decision to retain certain provisions of the Rule while supplementing or amending others, as described
in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, comports with the legal standards discussed earlier governing Section 18
rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vast majority of rulemaking participants supported the Rule's retention, or its expansion to cover other sellers.
Of the 189 NPR commenters and 83 public hearing witnesses, only eight unequivocally advocated repeal of the Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two participants suggested repeal as an alternative, if the Commission declined to make various substantive amendments;
two advocated repeal because, in their view, existing state laws were deemed adequate to protect consumers.

Those four include: The NSM (R&hyph;G&hyph;3; R&hyph;M&hyph;9 at 224) (repeal unless major amendments are adopted
as proposed and a ``sunset'' date is mandated); the NYS Funeral Directors Association (R&hyph;G&hyph;4) (Rule is
redundant to New York law); Mr. Hocker, President, NFDA, Tr. Vol. III, 1399, 1400, 1444&hyph;1445 (NFDA advocates
repeal, but his personal objections are limited to three areas_affirmative telephone disclosure, GPL timing and
distribution, and prior permission to embalm; otherwise, the Rule has educated consumers about the funeral process
and many providers say they are not overly burdened by the Rule); and Mr. Farrow, Exec. Dir, Texas Funeral Service Commission,
Tr. Vol. III, 550&hyph;551, 573 (Rule is unnecessary in light of Texas funeral law, which is patterned after the Rule
and benefits consumers).

The NFDA, the largest association of funeral industry firms, was the major proponent of repeal,
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 asserting that repeal is warranted because the Rule has imposed significant costs but failed to provide its promised
benefits of increased competition and altered patterns of consumer behavior. According to the NFDA, the evidence
shows that consumers in selecting funeral providers and types of funeral service still place a higher importance
on social, moral and practical factors (such as provider reputation and quality of service) than they do on price.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The NFDA concluded that the evidence logically demonstrates that consumers under the Rule spend no less for funeral
arrangements, comparison shop no more, and purchase no fewer items and no different types of service than they did
before the Rule. The NFDA asserted that the Rule has imposed various monetary costs on providers that have been passed
on to consumers in the form of higher prices, as well as non-monetary costs that interfere with providers' ability
to give caring, quality service. The NFDA thus concluded that the Rule should be repealed in its entirety because its
costs outweigh its benefits.

One issue raised during the proceedings was whether individual members of the NFDA or other trade groups agree that
the Rule warrants repeal. Several surveys and other evidence introduced into the record indicated that many funeral
directors may not wholly agree with the NFDA view. See, e.g., HX&hyph;32 (American Funeral Director magazine survey
asked its funeral director readers ``How would you recommend that the NFDA deal with the Funeral Rule during the forthcoming
Review?'' 70% responded that the Rule should be accepted as is or partially modified, 12% suggested substantial modification,
and 20% repeal; 88% of firms represented by respondent funeral directors were NFDA members); See also, Hocker, President,
NFDA, Tr. Vol. III, 1400 (many funeral directors say they are not overly burdened by the Rule); Hunter, President,
NSM, Tr. Vol. I, 790&hyph;791 (majority of NSM members do not advocate repeal; parts of it have been very helpful);
Ayers, HX&hyph;108 at 3 (68% of 500 funeral directors surveyed agreed that the Rule's required information was beneficial
to consumers).

However, the NFDA suggested that price plays a greater role in consumers' selections of individual items involved
in the funeral, such as caskets and outer burial containers. R&hyph;M&hyph;9 at 20.

In contrast to the NFDA's view, the AARP provided the most vigorous support for retention of the Rule.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 The AARP advocated that a decision to repeal the Rule must be founded on substantial evidence demonstrating that:
(1) The acts and practices addressed by the Rule are no longer prevalent; (2) the harm resulting from those practices
has been removed; (3) repeal would not permit the return of that harm; and (4) the benefits of repeal exceed the costs
of continuing the Rule. According to the AARP, those questions cannot be answered, and the Rule's full impact cannot
be assessed, because the record evidence reveals unacceptably low levels of industry compliance and consumer awareness
of the Rule's provisions. Because the Rule's full impact cannot be gauged, the AARP concluded, repeal is unwarranted.
The AARP further asserted that the evidence indicates that the Rule has not increased funeral providers' costs, funeral
prices, or consumer expenditures, but has begun to provide a variety of consumer benefits. The AARP thus further concluded
that, although the Commission need not meet a specific evidentiary burden to retain the Rule, such evidence exists
to support the conclusion that the Rule's benefits exceed its costs.

2. Costs and Benefits Compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has concluded, based on its review of the rulemaking record viewed as a whole, that the Rule warrants
retention because its actual and potential benefits to consumers outweigh its costs to providers, and that those
benefits are likely to increase over time as the Rule continues to operate. The Commission finds that, at the time of
this review: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Rule has not been effective in the funeral market for a sufficient period to permit a full assessment of its benefits;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The market is increasingly price-sensitive for the selection of funeral providers, types of service, and individual
goods and services, particularly caskets, when price and options information is readily available during the selection
process; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Despite a documented, low overall compliance level, pro-competitive and informational benefits attributable
in part to the Rule appear to be manifesting in the market and are likely to increase over time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Rule overall imposes minimal compliance burdens on providers that do not significantly raise their business
costs or prices, or reduce consumers' satisfaction with the funeral services they receive; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Most states have not adopted laws similar to the Rule in scope and coverage, and such action is not likely in the near
future.

a. Levels of compliance/price competition/consumer Awareness. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The evidence in the record indicates, at the time of this review, a low level of industry compliance with the Rule. Systematic,
empirical data from two independent surveys_the Commission-sponsored, 1987 Replication Study and the 1988 Gallup
Study conducted for the AARP_show that 36% of funeral providers simultaneously complied with the Rule's two key requirements
to give consumers a general price list (``GPL'') and an itemized final statement of goods and services selected.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 Using the more comprehensive Replication Study results, that overall compliance level dropped to 31% when misrepresentation
provisions about the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation are added to the analysis,
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 and to 9% when the GPL timing requirement is viewed strictly and several other Rule provisions are considered.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 Most rulemaking participants opined, when asked, that a 30% level of compliance would be insufficient to assess adequately
the Rule's benefits.

obligations individually, 23% of RS providers gave consumers the GPL_the key price disclosure document required
by the Rule_at the outset of arrangements discussions as required, and 62% gave consumers who purchased a funeral
on an item-by-item basis a properly itemized final statement. See HX&hyph;122 at Table VIII, p.20 and Table X, p.24.

R&hyph;M&hyph;5 (Staff Rebuttal) at 27, Table 8; R&hyph;B&hyph;2 (Replication Study/Market Facts Report) data
tapes. In the BE analysis (HX&hyph;122), RS respondents were considered to have been the beneficiaries of ``compliance''
with respect to receipt of the GPL if they reported its receipt after discussions had begun but before selection of
a casket or other container. BE staff, at the rulemaking staff's request, re-computed the compliance index using
the Rule's definition of when a GPL must be given to consumers _``upon beginning discussion either of funeral arrangements
or of the selection of any funeral goods or funeral services.'' The result was that compliance with four of the Rule's
provisions fell from 31% to 15% (timely receipt of the GPL and a properly-itemized statement, and no misrepresentations
about the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation). Overall, simultaneous compliance continued to drop
from a ``high'' of 29% (using the most stringent BE compliance index, which added receipt of the GPL ``in writing''
to the four requirements stated above) to a ``low'' of 9% as other Rule provisions were added to the analysis.

In addition to the relatively low level of overall industry Rule compliance, the rulemaking record demonstrates
that funeral providers have not provided the initial stimulus for ``increased competition'' on the basis of price
considered necessary by the Commission. The few funeral home entrants that aggressively compete on price, documented
in the record, appear to be former, more traditional funeral directors who reentered the market as ``discount'' providers,
and who are considered to be ``mavericks'' by the funeral industry as a whole. More traditional funeral homes, by industry
representatives' own admission, generally do not price advertise or otherwise compete on the basis of price.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 The record further indicates that funeral providers show little support for unfettered competition in the sale of
pre-need funeral services,
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 and that many affirmatively attempt to discourage potential price competition from third-party cemeteries and
other non-funeral home retailers who sell caskets on a pre-need basis, by imposing so-called ``casket handling fees,''
averaging $300&hyph;$500 per funeral on consumers who patronize those sellers.

The testimony of various funeral directors and cemeterians indicates that funeral providers as a group have supported
state 100 percent pre-need ``trusting'' laws. The major impact of a ``100 percent'' trusting requirement_all moneys
received from the consumer for a pre-need purchase must be placed in trust until the time of need_is to leave the pre-need
seller without current funds to pay for the expenses associated with pre-need sales, such as an active sales force.

Finally, the empirical data and record testimony documents that a majority of consumers exhibit low levels of awareness
concerning their rights under the Rule
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 and funeral prices and service options,
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 as a result of a general lack of ``visibility'' of the Rule and of readily-available, comparative price information.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 Other empirical evidence indicates that consumers' ``experience'' with funerals is low by any measure
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 and that, regardless of their level of experience, consumers are not ``familiar'' with the funeral transaction.
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 Most rulemaking participants concluded that the documented low levels of overall industry compliance and consumer
knowledge, viewed together, indicate that the Rule has not been in place long enough to adequately assess its impact
on the funeral market.

Although not uncontroverted by the rulemaking staff and funeral industry representatives, the results of two national,
consumer opinion surveys indicated that: (1) When asked whether they were ``familiar with the FTC's Funeral Rule
and what it requires,'' 90 percent of the 782 respondents aged 45 and above surveyed in the first of these ``Excel''
surveys said ``no'' and 10 percent answered ``yes;'' and (2) when asked whether each of several declarative statements
about funeral director obligations and funeral consumer rights was ``required by federal law or not,'' a majority
(54 percent-75 percent) of the 916 consumer-respondents aged 21 and over said that, to the best of their knowledge,
federal law does not require the rights and obligations actually mandated by the Funeral Rule, or said that they do
not know. See McFadden, HX&hyph;8 at 3 and Exhibit B, Table 001; Soulas, HX&hyph;76 at 3. The ``McFadden'' survey results
also provided evidence that older consumers aged 65 or over are significantly less likely to be aware of the Rule's
protections than are younger consumers aged 18&hyph;34. HX&hyph;8 at Exhibit B, tables 002&hyph;004, 006&hyph;007.

Thirty-six percent of the RS respondents reported that they had no prior experience arranging funerals; another
30 percent said that they had participated in planning arrangements once before, and the remaining third said they
had done so twice before or more. R&hyph;B&hyph;2 at III&hyph;9, Table III&hyph;7. Because the RS surveyed recent
funeral arrangers, however, and not the general public, the level of respondents' prior experience may not be representative
of the population as a whole. The Commission found, for example, that, at the time it promulgated the Rule, about 50
percent of the adult population had never arranged a funeral and another quarter had done so only once. See R&hyph;B&hyph;5

The Bureau of Economics staff performed an analysis of the RS data to determine whether there was any link between respondents'
degree of experience in making funeral arrangements (Question 10. of the study) and their level of knowledge about
the funeral transaction (Question 55 asked whether embalming is required by law and whether a sealed casket/vault
preserves remains indefinitely). BE staff divided respondents into two categories_those with arrangements experience
prior to the one surveyed and those without such prior experience. BE staff then performed a statistical test to determine
whether there was any relationship between those two categories and their answers to Question 55. BE staff found no
relationship between the degree of respondents' reported prior experience and their level of knowledge. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1
(SR) at n. 124. In addition to BE's statistical test, the RS results show that 50 percent and 42 percent, respectively,
of the RS respondents, all of whom had arranged a funeral at least once, reported incorrectly that embalming was always
required as a public health measure and that a sealed casket/vault preserves remains for an indefinite time. R&hyph;B&hyph;2

b. Market price-sensitivity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consumers' demand for funerals, of course, is price inelastic. Record evidence indicates, however, that consumers'
selections of individual funeral providers, overall types of funeral service, and individual funeral goods and
services are price-sensitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumers value available price information in selecting a funeral home and in making specific funeral arrangements,
particularly when they receive the price information early in selecting funeral goods and services. With respect
to the selection of a provider, 52% of NSM survey respondents in the years 1983&hyph;1988 said that they considered
price ``very important'' in their funeral home selection, although other factors appeared to be more important;
only 19% considered price unimportant.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, ``low-cost'' funeral homes, where they exist, have increased their business substantially in recent
years as a direct result of their competitive pricing practices.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 Regarding the selection of specific goods and services, many consumers are purchasing competitively-priced caskets
from third-party sellers when they are available,
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 are increasingly choosing the significantly less-expensive cremation alternative,
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 are purchasing significantly fewer caskets and requesting embalming for cremation less frequently than in 1981,
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 and are declining items that used to be included in funeral ``packages.''
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Replication Study consumers who received price information early in the transaction spent $252 less for their specific
arrangements than those who did not get that timely information;
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 the earlier consumers received price information, the more likely they were to consider the information important
to their choices in making funeral arrangements.

The analysis is based on R&hyph;J&hyph;11, NSM Summary sheets, Question 1.f. See also, R&hyph;M&hyph;5 at 7&hyph;8.
The NSM Survey results are remarkably similar to those of the RS concerning the importance of price. That data indicate
that 56% of the survey respondents reported that the cost of funeral arrangements was ``very'' or ``somewhat'' important
in their decision to select the funeral home they used; 15% reported that cost was somewhat or very unimportant. R&hyph;B&hyph;2

The BE analysis showed that cremation selections increased from 11% in 1981 to 14% in 1987, and that the average cremation
cost to 1987 respondents was about one-third of the cost of open-casket funerals ($1,054 vs. $2,818). HX&hyph;122
at Table II, p. 6, Table III, p. 7. BE staff noted that the close similarity of the survey results to cremation statistics
provided by the CANA suggests that the BLS and RS are representative of the national population.

Thirty-four percent of cremation buyers in 1981 also purchased caskets, and 35 percent bought embalming services;
those selections dropped in 1987 to 19% (caskets) and 25% (embalming). R&hyph;B&hyph;3 (BLS) at Table 3, p. 23; R&hyph;B&hyph;2
(RS) at Table III&hyph;44, p. III&hyph;71 (caskets) and Table III&hyph;42, p. III&hyph;67 (embalming). Similarly,
CANA member surveys indicate a reduction in the purchase of caskets for cremation from 22% to 17% between 1983 and 1987,
a reduction which the CANA attributed to the Rule. See Kelsey, Tr. Vol. II, 310&hyph;312, Purdy, Tr. Vol. III, 158.

Seventy-six percent of consumers who received price information ``at the beginning'' of arrangements discussions
said that price information was very or somewhat important; 75% said so when they got price information ``before casket
selection;'' 62% who reported that they received such information ``when finalizing arrangements'' said that it
was very or somewhat important at that time; 67% said so when they got the information ``after decisions had been made;''
and 53% said so when there was ``no discussion of price.'' In the first three periods above, 41%, 31%, and 22% of respondents,
respectively, said that price information was ``very'' important. The analysis is based on consumers' answers to
RS questions 27 (when price information was first received) and 35(c)(5) (importance of price information in arranging
the funeral). R&hyph;B&hyph;2 at APPENDIX: Questionnaire, and data tape. See also, R&hyph;M&hyph;5 (Staff Rebuttal)

c. Pro-competitive/informational benefits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite the 31% overall industry compliance level with four of the Rule's key requirements
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 and the lack of price competition among funeral homes, competitive and informational benefits that are at least partially
attributable to the Rule have begun to manifest in the funeral market. Testimonial evidence establishes that the
Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure provisions have encouraged third-party casket sellers and low-cost
funeral homes to enter the market and have helped them compete,
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 in part because the GPL and telephone disclosure requirements permit non-industry entities to gather and publish
comparative price data.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 Many consumers have used that data to select those lower-cost funeral providers and purchase caskets from third-party
sellers where they exist.

Other testimonial evidence presented by the FFDA, which provides financial and accounting services to 1,500 independent
funeral home clients in 30 states, indicates that the Rule_through the availability of the GPL_has raised the industry's
``price consciousness,'' which may be partly responsible for the tempering of price increases in recent years.
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 Mandatory itemization may have helped retard the growth of funeral prices and consumer expenditures, a goal fully
intended by the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 Statistical data provided by the FFDA and the Replication Study, and analyzed by an economist for the AARP and the BE
staff, also establish that, although overall prices and consumer expenditures for funerals increased since 1981
by more than the general price level (the ``CPI&hyph;U''), which includes all goods and services, the increase was
comparable to the increase in service prices (the ``CPI&hyph;US,'' which excludes medical services); that is, compared
to other service industries,
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 funeral prices and expenditures in the period 1981&hyph;1987 did not increase above the rate of inflation.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 In 1988, expenditures and prices for funeral services increased by even less than the rate of inflation for the general
economy (the ``CPI&hyph;U'').

See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 76, 79&hyph;80. Even if overall industry compliance were higher and consumer expenditures
still remained unchanged, the level of expenditures is not the sole test of the Rule's benefits. As the BE staff stated
in its report, expenditures may rise as a result of price increases related to funeral homes' fixed costs that are not
associated with any costs of Rule compliance. The record evidence indicates, in fact, that Rule compliance has not
significantly increased funeral providers' costs or prices, that consumer expenditures and funeral prices, when
compared to other service industries, have not increased above inflation, and that an industry ``price consciousness''
induced by the availability of the GPL may have tempered price increases. If the Rule's only benefit were to increase
informed consumer choice (without imposing substantial costs on industry), regardless of whether some chose to
spend more for their arrangements than they would have without the Rule, that benefit would likely justify retention
of the Rule because other consumers would have the right to choose to spend less. The Commission in its 1982 SBP for the
Rule so stated the Rule's purpose. The record evidence in fact indicates that many consumers will purchase fewer funeral
items or less-expensive services as a result of informed choice.

In addition to these benefits, record evidence discussed above suggests that the Rule has helped increase consumers'
awareness of prices and service options as factors to consider in making funeral purchase decisions. Many consumers
choose low-cost funeral homes and caskets competitively offered by third-party providers, and consumers who chose
cremation in 1987 purchased fewer caskets and embalming than in 1981. Finally, that evidence indicated that consumers
now decline items once included in packaged funerals, and increasingly choose less-expensive cremation alternatives.

Although the record evidence supports the conclusion that the Rule facilitates consumers' choice of cremation,
the degree to which the Rule has affected the cremation rate is unclear from the record evidence. The NFDA suggested
that the Rule has not played an important role in the steadily increasing cremation rate, because the increase began
in the early 1970s and is based primarily on changing social and moral values, as well as on the wishes of the deceased,
and not on price concerns. The CANA and the AARP, in contrast, asserted that the Funeral Rule proceedings, which also
began in the early 1970s, as well as the Rule itself, substantially increased publicity about the cremation alternative,
and that many consumers do choose cremation based on price and other considerations. The CANA also provided evidence
that the marketing of cremation options has dramatically increased since the Rule's inception. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1

Other empirical evidence indicates that, since 1981, the proportion of consumers who receive price information
early in the funeral transaction, and use that information to spend less for their arrangements, has increased by
7%.
<FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>
 Consumer purchases of ``unneeded'' caskets and embalming for cremation have decreased,
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 as have provider misrepresentations about casket requirements,
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 and the accuracy of consumers' knowledge regarding casket for cremation and embalming requirements and the preservative
value of sealed caskets has increased slightly.
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 The great majority of rulemaking participants expressed the view that the actual and potential Rule benefits just
enumerated will tend to increase over time, as compliance with, and consumer awareness of, the Rule increases.

That data show that, in 1981, 18% and 11% of ``direct cremation'' purchasers, respectively, appear to have bought
embalming services and caskets that were unnecessary, because the body is not present during the service (making
embalming unnecessary) and is not buried (making a casket unnecessary). In 1987, those figures declined to 9% (unneeded
embalming) and 2% (unneeded caskets), respectively. See R&hyph;M&hyph;5 (Staff Rebuttal) at 9; R&hyph;B&hyph;2

Record data also indicate that those arguably ``unneeded'' casket purchases occurred in many cases as a result of

Seven percent of those 1987 RS respondents who purchased cremations said that the providers they used represented

did not include a response category permitting the compliant statement that an unfinished wood box (an alternative
container that is arguably a type of casket) was required. Eleven percent of the 1987 RS respondents answered the question

Although not directly related to pro-competitive and informational benefits, other empirical evidence based on
the Replication Study data and BE staff's compliance indices indicates that the proportion of consumers reporting
satisfaction with their arrangements steadily increases as simultaneous provider compliance with the Rule's provisions
increases.

 That evidence indicates that compliance with the Rule benefits consumers and funeral providers by increasing consumer
satisfaction with funeral service, and that the level of satisfaction might continue to increase if compliance with

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Rule has begun to provide benefits to consumers, empirical evidence demonstrates that its requirements
have not been a significant contributing factor to increases in funeral home costs of doing business or funeral home
prices, or to any reduction of overall consumer satisfaction with funeral services. Funeral provider groups, however,
asserted that the Rule has imposed on providers a variety of increased costs, most notably for personnel as a result
of a 23-minute average increase in the duration of the arrangements conference, and for business expenses such as
printing, accounting and legal services. These costs, those groups said, have been passed on to consumers in the form
of higher prices, particularly for professional services.

 and analyzed by an economist for the AARP, indicates that funeral home costs arguably most related to the Rule (such

and casket cost),

Federated Funeral Directors of America (FFDA) processes records from 1,500 funeral home clients in 30 states that
conduct about 181,000 funerals a year, representing just under 10% of all deaths. FFDA is the largest company of its
type in the country. Hahn, Tr. II, 662&hyph;663.

Dr. Barnow, speaking on behalf of the AARP, reported that his review of the FFDA data showed that accounting, consultants
and legal costs were responsible for 2.6% of the real increase in overall funeral home costs since 1981, whereas depreciation
and casket cost respectively accounted for 14.9% and 9.3% of the real increase in costs. See Dr. Barnow, HX&hyph;118
at 14 and Exhibit 2, pp.12&hyph;13. Dr. Barnow further stated that increased compliance would not substantially
increase the Rule's costs, because there are no identifiable, major costs imposed by the Rule now on providers. Tr.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When first proposed, many believed the Funeral Rule would lower funeral and cremation service prices because lower-priced
options would be made known to the consumer. However, when put into effect, the Funeral Rule caused funeral directors
to examine their costs. In doing so, many realized that they had been ``giving away'' some services. In effect, funeral
directors became more business-oriented as a result of the FTC rulings, and found that they could actually raise prices.

Further record analysis of the FFDA statistical data by BE staff indicates that funeral homes' personnel expenses
appear to have increased very slightly since 1984, but that personnel expense as a proportion of overall business
expense has not significantly changed in many years, including the period covered by the Rule. Similar analysis shows
that salary expense as a proportion of personnel cost has likewise remained stable.

e. State Regulation of Funeral Providers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rulemaking record finally documents that most individual states favor the continued existence and strong enforcement
of the Funeral Rule to protect funeral consumers, rather than reliance on the states to adopt comprehensive, state-specific
legislation. A 1987 staff survey of the states' funeral industry statutes, regulations and rules revealed that ten
states have incorporated the Rule by reference into their laws or adopted provisions similar to six of the Rule's most
salient requirements; six have enacted at least four of those provisions, and, overall, thirteen to twenty-five
states have laws that include one or more provisions similar to the Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
85
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No party presented evidence during the review that additional states have adopted relevant funeral laws or that existing
laws have been significantly strengthened.

Testimonial evidence presented by state legislators and officials further indicates that, although the Rule has
helped stimulate the enactment of similar funeral industry laws in several states, such reform is unlikely in their
or other states because of industry opposition. Those witnesses expressed their views that the Funeral Rule needs
to be retained as a result, and is beneficial to consumers, funeral providers, and state enforcement officials.

C. Section-by-Section Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule as amended contains two major changes_deletion of the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement and
the prohibition of non-declinable fees (such as so-called ``casket handling fees'' and ``basic facilities fees'')
charged in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic professional services of the funeral director and staff.
These primary changes, and a number of ``fine-tuning'' amendments, are intended to increase the Rule's benefits
and reduce its costs by facilitating funeral providers' compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's
requirements, while preserving the integrity of the Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission has made several technical amendments to the Rule that are necessary to correct inconsistencies
or unnecessary language in certain Rule provisions, or to complement other amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Affirmative Telephone Disclosure Repeal: Section 453.2(b)(1)(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.2(b)(1)(i) of the original Rule required funeral providers to affirmatively tell persons who call and
ask about the ``terms, conditions, or prices'' at which funeral goods or funeral services are offered that price information
is available over the telephone. The Commission has decided that the affirmative telephone disclosure provision
should be deleted from the Rule because its costs outweigh its actual and potential benefits to consumers, and because
the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retaining the requirement to provide
price information over the telephone on request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission designed this provision to help consumers in two ways. First, it would alert them to the availability
of price information over the telephone, and, second, it might diminish consumers' reluctance to seek such information.
The Commission intended that affirmative disclosure provision to facilitate consumers' comparison shopping for
a provider.

Empirical evidence presented by the Replication Study, however, indicated that few consumers comparison shop before
selecting a provider. The Commission in the NPR thus requested public comment on whether: (1) Consumers are aware
of their right to seek price information over the telephone; (2) compliance with this provision is costly; and (3)
it should retain the affirmative telephone disclosure provision in view of the study results.

Empirical and testimonial evidence in the record provided insights into the delicate relationship between consumers
and funeral providers that appear to affect the degree to which consumers seek price information directly from providers.
Results from the Baseline, Replication and Gallup Studies indicated that consumers seldom seek price information
or comparison shop by calling providers directly. In 1981, 7.2% of the Baseline Study respondents comparison shopped
by contacting more than one funeral home;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
89
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 4.2% of the 1987 Replication Study respondents did so,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
90
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 11% of the 1988 Gallup Study consumers contacted more than one provider.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
91
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most 1987 Replication Study respondents knew which funeral provider they intended to use,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
92
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and those who had not decided on a funeral provider usually contacted only one at the time of need.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

Record evidence indicated that both consumers and providers are reluctant to initiate price discussions during
funeral arrangements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
95
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The evidence indicates that, unlike a visit to the funeral home, where the general price list facilitates the actual
review of services and merchandise, the offer to discuss prices over the telephone is helpful only if the consumer
is prepared to do so. The weight of the evidence demonstrates that the initial telephone contact is a tentative encounter
in which the consumer is relying on the funeral provider to set the tone of the interaction. The funeral provider at
that delicate time, however, reasonably wishes to avoid the appearance of insensitivity by raising price issues
when the callers' typical concerns are whether and how to arrange the funeral with the particular provider.

Several provider witnesses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
96
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 testified that the affirmative telephone disclosure has offended callers, who interpret the disclosure as an indication
of the funeral provider's preoccupation with the consumer's ability to afford services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
97
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For example, a state funeral board member observed that, whenever a client calls first to arrange a date and time for
a funeral service, expecting an empathic response, the consumer is offended by the funeral director's uninvited
statement that price information is available, and the funeral provider resentful about having to make such a statement
at this early juncture.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
98
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other providers distinguished between the accepted practice of giving price information that is requested, and
the difficulty of telling the caller who has not requested it that the funeral provider is prepared to talk about prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
99
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Funeral director representatives concluded that providers' goodwill is harmed as a result of the offense generated
by the unsolicited affirmative disclosure, which providers under the Rule must make during the initial telephone
contact.

during the initial telephone discussion that price information is available was offensive or confusing to consumers.
The Gallup results indicated that most arrangers (83%) are not offended ``when funeral directors give them information
about the cost of funeral services when they first begin making arrangements.'' See Colasanto, HX&hyph;66 at Appendix
B, Tabulations, p. 24. That question, however, refers more specifically to consumers' feelings about actual price
information offered by providers during the arrangements conference, such as providers' offer of the GPL, and not
to consumers' views about the affirmative telephone disclosure that price information is available.

The evidence further shows that providers experience difficulty in understanding their obligation under &sect;453.2
(b)(1)(i). Under that affirmative disclosure provision, a funeral provider must either tell every caller that price
information is available, or determine whether an inquiry concerns a ``term,'' ``condition,'' or ``price'' of funeral
goods or funeral services offered, thus triggering the disclosure. The original staff Compliance Guidelines illustrated
that problem; the Guidelines told funeral providers that a call asking whether the provider will perform a funeral
for a particular religion does not trigger the disclosure, whereas a call asking whether the provider will remove
the deceased from a hospital does.

The Commission, however, has not adopted the AARP-suggested modification that would resolve this compliance problem
by requiring funeral providers to inform all callers that price information is available over the telephone. The
record contains substantial evidence that some consumers would be offended unnecessarily by such unsolicited remarks,
and that substantial harm to funeral providers' reputations could occur, without significant consumer benefit.
These possibilities further may increase the likelihood of non-compliance, which the evidence suggests may be no
greater than 50% at this time. On balance, ensuring that those callers who seek price information can obtain it would
better assist consumers in making informed selections.

Other empirical data indicate that the disclosure does not affect consumers' expenditures for funeral arrangements.
Economic analysis of the Replication Study data indicated that those consumers who called the provider and received
the Rule-required affirmative disclosure spent no less for their arrangements than other respondents.

Consumer group participants, however, suggested that the affirmative disclosure was meant to signal consumers
who are reluctant to raise price issues that it is acceptable to do so, and that providers can find ways to make that disclosure
without offending consumers.

 Although the empirical evidence is not conclusive on the issue, the preponderance of the reliable anecdotal evidence
provided by many funeral directors who must make the disclosure to consumers supports the conclusion that the requirement's
potential to overcome consumers' inhibitions and benefit additional consumers is unlikely, and does not justify
the imposition of awkwardness and potential offense in a transaction already fraught with delicate business, social
and personal issues.

In summary, the record evidence shows that consumers rarely price shop for a funeral home or seek price information
directly from providers because of their reluctance to do so and their general lack of awareness about prices charged
by providers, and not because of a conviction that price information cannot be requested over the telephone. The affirmative
disclosure that price information is available thus does not appear to give consumers new information that is likely
to increase their desire to ask about prices or to encourage price shopping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record evidence further indicates, however, that the Rule overall is contributing to increased consumer ``price
sensitivity'' that leads some additional consumers to use the telephone to shop for lower-cost providers, or to seek
comparative price information from non-industry sources. Consequently, consumers who want price information
will affirmatively use the telephone to seek such information from providers who advertise prices, or to engage in
alternative shopping methods, such as calling memorial societies, media price ``hotlines,'' or state agencies
that make comparative price information available.

The preponderance of the evidence in the rulemaking record indicates that the affirmative telephone disclosure

 Nor does the evidence support a conclusion that industry compliance with the affirmative telephone provision is
too low to permit a conclusion about its potential benefits. The evidence on compliance with &sect;453.2(b)(1)(i)
is inconclusive. The RS data show that about half of all providers (49%) who were asked about funeral ``prices, terms,
or conditions'' over the telephone made the required disclosure. However, an unusually large proportion of the respondents_29%&hyph;31%_could
not recall whether they received the disclosure, and the study contractor warned that the results should be viewed
with extreme caution because of the small cell size (93 respondents called and asked about ``prices, terms, or conditions'').
Excluding from the analysis those who could not recall increases the compliance level to about 72%. See R&hyph;B&hyph;2
(RS) at III&hyph;36, Table III&hyph;26; HX&hyph;122 (BE Report) at 16&hyph;17 (compliance results); R&hyph;B&hyph;2

In light of this evidence, the Commission has determined to repeal the affirmative telephone disclosure provision
because its potential to benefit additional consumers is unlikely, and does not warrant the intrusion of potential
offense in what is otherwise an extremely delicate business, social and personal transaction. The Commission further
concludes that the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retention of the general
requirement to provide price and other readily-available information over the telephone on request (&sect;453.2(B)(1)).

107

The Commission in its Statement of Basis and Purpose for the Rule clearly expressed its view that the general telephone
requirement to give price information on request, and the requirement to give the GPL to any person seeking in-person
information about funeral arrangements, in addition to the affirmative telephone disclosure, would all contribute
to increased comparison shopping.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nevertheless, the Commission did not base the Rule's entire success in reducing barriers to price competition on
the affirmative telephone disclosure or on comparison shopping, because it fully recognized that such behavior
might always be infrequent.

 As described above, the Rule's provisions already are providing pro-competitive benefits to consumers, including
increased price sensitivity, despite the low overall levels of industry compliance, price competition and consumer
knowledge demonstrated by the record. Those benefits are likely to increase over time as industry compliance with,
and consumer awareness of, the Rule's other provisions increases.

from cemeteries and other third-parties, charge high ``casket handling fees'' for arrangements where consumers
supply their own caskets purchased from those third parties.

The PAA Survey provided empirical evidence on the widespread existence and amount of ``casket handling fees,'' as
reported by the respondent retailers. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said that at least 60% of the funeral
homes in their market area assess handling fees, about two-thirds said that 80% to 100% charge the fees, and one-quarter
reported that all of the homes impose the casket handling fee.

Concerning the amount of ``casket handling fees'' assessed, 81% of the PAA Survey respondents said that the average

 Wendell Hahn of the FFDA, which provides financial advising services to 1,500 providers in 30 states, testified that
handling fees are assessed because providers, who typically charge professional service fees ``hundreds of dollars''
below their true operation cost, will try to recoup those costs that are lost by the third-party casket sale. Mr. Hahn
concluded that handling fees are thus roughly equal to the amount that providers' non-declinable service fees are
underpriced.

See Hahn, FFDA, HX&hyph;49 at 2. The average mark-up in 1988 was $1,338 (average retail casket price) minus $517 (average
wholesale cost), or $821. By definition, a handling fee must be ``high'' if its purpose is to recoup overhead costs
and profit lost on the casket sale.

Several local surveys conducted by individual casket retailers provided further evidence on the range of ``casket
handling fees'' in given market areas. Those surveys found that handling fees ranged from $100 to $700 in Chicago;

six instances among a sampling of funeral home records he reviewed for the month of August 1988 where handling fees
ranging from $75 to $480 were disclosed on providers' GPLs. HX&hyph;49 at 5, Tr. Vol. II, 673, 719&hyph;720. Other

Record evidence indicates that ``casket handling fees'' prevent potential price competition and reduce consumer
choice. Ninety-two percent of the casket seller respondents to the PAA Survey reported that their casket sales have

marketing efforts as a result of those fees.

Casket retailers and others provided evidence that many third-party sellers offer caskets at prices lower than those
charged by funeral homes. About half of the seventeen PAA Survey respondents who answered the survey's price question
said that their price for the ``same or similar'' casket was at least $250 less than funeral home prices in their market
area. About one-quarter said that their prices were between $100 and $250 less, and another quarter said that their
prices were comparable (within $100). See, Radovich, HX&hyph;101 at Ex. B, p. 10. One retailer who commented on the
ANPR reported that a small casket manufacturer in Chicago was selling 90% of its retail caskets on an at-need basis,
charging about half that of Chicago funeral homes_$250 for a cloth-covered casket and $650 for a sealed, metal casket.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proponents of handling fees did not provide evidence to refute that offered by casket retailers and others on the purpose,
prevalence and impact of ``casket handling fees'' on the casket market. Funeral provider representatives, for example,
did not dispute that ``casket handling fees'' are used to recoup profits and overhead costs lost to third-party casket
sales, but defended that purpose on several grounds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
135
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Providers' responses to third-party casket sales arise, the trade groups asserted, due to the industry's long-standing
tradition of recovering much of its overhead costs and profits through the casket mark-up, and not by increasing service
fees; lower service fees allow funeral homes to provide full service funerals, including lower-priced caskets,
to those who might not otherwise be able to afford them. Although providers in recent years have shifted some of that
casket mark-up to service fees, the shift has been very gradual. The industry groups concluded that providers who
lose casket sales to third parties must, as a result, still forego the recovery of much of their costs and profits that
would have been included in the casket sale.

Nor did the NFDA and NSM argue that ``casket handling fees'' are imposed for actual services rendered in ``handling''
consumer-supplied caskets. Many witnesses, including funeral directors, testified that providers incur no additional
labor or insurance costs when third-party sellers provide a casket, and that the actual labor time spent handling
any casket is minimal; the cost for that service is normally included in the non-declinable professional services
fee. See R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 182; Hahn, FFDA, Tr. Vol. II, 692&hyph;693; Bates, NSM Executive Director,

Those groups asserted that the imposition of ``casket handling fees'' is an isolated, non-discriminatory practice
that fairly allocates providers' overhead costs and profits; the purpose of the fee is to obtain from consumers who
buy third-party caskets consumers' proportionate share of providers' costs and profits for rendering the funeral
service. Providers' only alternative to handling fees, the industry groups argued, would be to raise service fees
charged to all consumers, which, in effect, would require regular clients who purchase providers' caskets to subsidize
the funerals of consumers who purchase their caskets elsewhere_by paying the mark-up on the casket as well as the higher
service fee that would result from other consumers supplying their own caskets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those groups further asserted that handling fees are not assessed for ship-ins, outer burial container sales traditionally
lost to competing cemeteries, or for direct cremation/immediate burials where the consumer supplies the alternative
container because, unlike the unexpected loss of a casket sale to a third-party seller, providers set prices for those
services with the knowledge that they will not make a sale in those cases. Finally, the funeral groups concluded that
the amount of ``casket handling fees'' is sufficiently regulated by the market, because providers that charge unreasonably
high fees will offend consumers and lose market share.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has concluded that substantial ``casket handling fees'' are imposed on consumers by a significant
proportion of providers wherever third-party casket sellers exist, and, as a result, frustrate the Rule's ``unbundling''
requirements and result in the reduction of potential competition in the sale of caskets fostered by the Funeral Rule.

 Others may use handling fees as a direct response to third-party competition. In either case, the issue to be determined
in this proceeding was whether the Rule should allow providers to condition a consumer's right under the Rule to obtain
a funeral service with a consumer-supplied casket upon the payment of a non-declinable fee, charged in addition to
the basic professional services fee (already permitted under the Rule to be non-declinable), or whether the Rule
should require providers to recoup costs and profits lost to third-party casket sales in ways that do not violate the
intent of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision. For example, providers under the Rule may recoup any unallocated
costs or profits lost to third-party casket sales in the non-declinable professional services fee permitted by &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).
The Commission has determined that the latter course is warranted to affirm the Rule's intent to increase consumer
choice and reduce barriers to price competition.

The Commission disagrees with arguments made by funeral provider groups during the proceeding that regulation of
handling fees would amount to ``price regulation.'' The primary issue is the propriety of the handling fee cost and
profit adjustment, through the imposition of a separate, non-declinable fee charged in addition to the non-declinable
fee for ``services of funeral director and staff,'' and not the amount of the handling fee.

Section 453.4(b) of the Funeral Rule was intended to address all ``bundling'' arrangements imposed on consumers
by funeral providers. Under that provision, consumers have the right to decline the purchase of any item, including
a casket, from a funeral provider, and may elect to supply their own. That right, however, is illusory if funeral providers
can condition consumers' choice on the payment of an additional, non-declinable fee. The fee, in any amount, penalizes
consumers for exercising their choice afforded by the Rule.

Section 453.4(b)(2)(ii) of the Rule permits providers to refuse a request for goods and services that would be ``impossible,
impractical, or excessively burdensome'' to provide. That provision, however, does not permit a funeral provider
to refuse service to a consumer because the consumer supplied the casket. See, e.g., Staff Opinion Letter to George
W. Lemke, Executive Director, Casket Manufacturers Association of America (March 18, 1985), FTC File No. 215&hyph;46,

``Casket handling fees'' require consumers to pay two substantial mark-ups, one on the casket they purchase from
the third-party seller, and another on the casket they did not buy from the funeral provider. The evidence indicates
that handling fees average between $300 and $500, and often are higher. That burden, the evidence shows, effectively
removes consumers' economic incentive to purchase a casket from anyone but the funeral provider. Casket sales by
third parties have declined as a result, and several retailers have curtailed their marketing efforts or withdrawn
from the market. Handling fees thus frustrate the purpose of the Funeral Rule_to ensure informed consumer choice
and foster a competitive funeral market. The Commission thus concludes that casket handling fees are unfair conditions
on a consumer's right to decline unwanted items he or she may wish to purchase elsewhere, in violation of section 5 of
the FTC Act, and the spirit of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision (&sect;453.4(b)).

 Conditioning the furnishing of any funeral good or service upon the payment of a so-called ``casket handling fee,''
or any other non-declinable fee not otherwise permitted by the Rule, is an unfair practice for the same reasons articulated
by the Commission in declaring ``package-only'' pricing unfair when it promulgated the Funeral Rule and its general
``unbundling'' section_453.4(b) (the practice is prevalent and imposes substantial and unavoidable injury on
consumers). See R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (SBP) at 42269&hyph;71.

Section 453.4(b), however, does not specifically address the practice of conditioning the furnishing of any funeral
goods or services on the payment of fees, such as ``casket handling'' fees, because those fees have developed since
the Rule's implementation, and because they are not conditioned charges for ``goods'' or ``services''_the conditioned
products referred to in that provision. The Commission thus has concluded that so-called ``casket handling'' fees,
and other non-declinable fees that are more aptly referred to as ``recovery of overhead and profit'' fees, need to
be separately addressed in the Rule.

 The Commission prohibits fees that are similar in purpose to ``casket handling fees'' in its Advertising of Ophthalmic
Goods and Services Trade Regulation Rule, 16 CFR Part 456. That Rule requires eye doctors to give consumers a copy of
their eyeglass prescription, so that consumers can shop for eyeglasses. Section 456.7(c) of that Rule further prohibits
eye doctors from charging consumers a fee ``as a condition for releasing the prescription,'' other than the examination
fee. The section thus prevents eye doctors from charging a fee for goods and services not provided that, in effect,
would penalize consumers who wish to comparison shop for ophthalmic goods. Like the non-declinable ``casket handling
fee,'' the conditional fee prohibited by this Ophthalmic Goods and Services Rule frustrates a consumer's right under
the Rule to exercise free choice.

The Commission recognizes the legitimate desire and expectation of funeral industry members to recover overhead
costs and realize a profit. The Rule, however, permits consumers to select and buy only the items wanted unless state
or local law require otherwise. The Funeral Rule is designed to permit funeral providers to have one non-declinable
fee to recover general overhead costs_the fee for the basic services of funeral director and staff. Permitting funeral
providers to have additional surcharges, whether they are called ``casket handling fees,'' or something else, would
frustrate the Rule's aim to promote full itemization and informed consumer choice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent that result and clarify the current requirements of the Rule, the Commission has added paragraph (b)(1)(ii)
to &sect;453.4 of the Rule. That amendment prohibits as an unfair or deceptive act or practice the furnishing of funeral
goods or services upon payment of any conditional ``fees'' not otherwise permitted by the Rule. The amendment, however,
permits funeral providers to recover overhead in the two ways permitted by the original Rule_by marking up the items
offered for sale to the public, and by having the non-declinable fee for basic services of funeral director and staff,
permitted by &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) and 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A) of the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also has amended &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)(2) of the Rule to require, among other things, disclosure
of: (1) The dollar amount charged for any non-declinable basic professional services when that charge is included
in the price of the provider's caskets; and (2) the statement ``This same fee shall be added to the total cost of your
funeral arrangements if you provide the casket.'' These amendments are intended to have the same effect as the amendment
to &sect;453.4(b) above_they prohibit funeral providers (who choose not to itemize the charge for basic professional
services) from charging consumers who purchase caskets from third parties a non-declinable fee for recovery of overhead
and profit in addition to the professional services fee charged to all customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These two amendments are not intended to impede funeral providers from recovering overhead costs and earning profits
from their operations. Efficient providers can structure their prices charged to all consumers to recover the revenue
lost to third-party casket (or other merchandise) sales. The evidence indicates that providers for many years have
so adjusted their pricing structure to account for consumer-supplied caskets (in ship-in cases), outer burial containers,
and alternative containers.

Providers asserted that the impact of a ban on imposing separate, non-declinable casket handling fees, in addition
to the non-declinable professional services fee, would be increased professional service fees to all consumers.
The funeral provider industry made the same argument in the original proceeding regarding the effect of consumer
declinations caused by Rule-required itemization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
143
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the Commission reasoned at that time, providers under the Rule can set or shift prices as they wish, but the long-term
competitive impact of the Rule's price availability provisions might not permit providers to recover lost revenue
from casket declinations simply by raising professional service fees. In the short-term, some consumers might spend
more and some less than they would without the right to decline if providers actually raise service fees in order to
recoup revenue lost to third-party casket sales. As discussed earlier, however, the evidence in this proceeding
indicates that, although service fees generally are underpriced by roughly the average handling fee amount, providers
are reluctant to raise service fees even under current competitive conditions. In any event, the evidence indicates
that the impact of a ban on handling fees would more likely be increased competition in the sale of caskets, and, in turn,
an overall reduction in casket prices over time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.2(b)(4) of the Rule required providers to give for retention a General Price List to persons who inquire
in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services. The GPL must contain, among other
things, several disclosures about consumers' right to select only those items they desire and the retail prices for
17 specified items, if offered for sale. Providers under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i) of the original Rule were required
to offer the GPL ``

upon beginning discussion either of funeral arrangements or of the selection of any funeral goods or funeral services.''

Many funeral providers, however, erroneously believe that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation of preliminary
arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. That misinterpretation leads
them to offer the GPL at arguably inappropriate times, such as during preliminary discussions of death certificates
or veterans benefits, or, in the case of an out-of-town death, the location of the deceased.

The Commission has determined, however, that the preponderance of the evidence does not warrant the sweeping amendments
to, or repeal of, &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i) as proposed by funeral provider groups. The Commission draws that conclusion
particularly in light of the empirical evidence on the level of providers' compliance with the current GPL requirements
(23% give the GPL at the outset of arrangements discussions), and the evidence that consumers want price and options
information about funeral goods and services and value price information that they receive early in the funeral transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is persuaded by that compliance evidence, however, that some fine-tuning is necessary to clarify
the Rule and promote increased compliance, thereby enhancing the Rule's opportunity to provide benefits to consumers.
The amendment discussed below thus is intended to remove any ambiguities and unnecessary rigidity in &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i)
that appear to cause funeral directors to misinterpret their obligations under that provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provider group proposals would have unacceptably narrowed the circumstances in which providers would be required
to provide a GPL to consumers. First, the suggestion that providers ``make available'' a GPL might have been tantamount
to effective repeal of the entire GPL requirement if such language means something other than physically giving the
GPL to consumers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
147
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consumers might receive no GPL disclosures about funeral service prices or options, or concerning their rights in
the funeral transaction under the Rule or other laws, unless they asked to see the GPL and providers voluntarily complied
with their request. Such a change is not warranted, given record evidence on relatively low, overall levels of Rule
compliance. Other evidence_that consumers are reluctant to raise price issues after the death of a loved one, that
consumers, nonetheless, desire price and service options information, and that consumers benefit from price information
they receive early in the funeral transaction_also supports this conclusion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the NFDA suggestion that providers need only give a GPL to persons who inquire in person about the ``price''
of funeral goods or services would eliminate the obligation to give a GPL to those who ask about prices 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``funeral arrangements.'' In light of the evidence just mentioned, this proposed narrowing of the GPL distribution
requirement is not supported by the record. Although one of the Rule's goals is to increase price competition, and,
in turn, reduce overall consumer expenditures, the Commission also intended the provision of itemized price information
to alert consumers to their various options and to permit them to select only those items they desire, whether or not
expenses would be reduced as a result.

Virtually every funeral director who advocated a change in the GPL timing requirements expressed concern about when
in the arrangements discussions might be the sensitively correct time to discuss ``price'' with consumers. None
spoke of the correct time to provide or discuss information about funeral service ``options'' and their relative
cost. The record evidence, however, suggested that because price issues may not specifically arise early in the transaction,
due to mutual provider and consumer reluctance, consumers may choose particular types of arrangements, or specific
items, without the benefit of information about the available alternatives unless they receive a timely GPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, the NFDA proposal that providers make the GPL available at the funeral arrangements conference before ``specific''
funeral goods and services are selected or prices discussed would remove the requirement that providers give the
list at the beginning of arrangements discussions, wherever they take place. Record evidence shows that consumers
benefit from price and service options information, including the GPL, that they receive early in selecting funeral
goods and services, and that at least some funeral arrangements, short of a formal ``arrangements conference,''
often can and do occur away from the funeral home premises.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
149
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other evidence discussed earlier demonstrated that consumers' knowledge generally about the funeral transaction,
although somewhat improved, is still relatively low. As a result of adopting the NFDA suggestion, consumers' opinions
about the overall type of funeral service or individual items could thus be formed, or actual selections made, without
the benefit of the GPL disclosures concerning prices, options and consumer rights under the Rule. In that event, the
preponderance of the record evidence supports the conclusion that the GPL's purpose to provide ready price and service
options information for consultation while consumers are considering what goods to purchase, before they make selections,
would be unnecessarily defeated.

Finally, the NFDA-NSM proposal that the GPL's ``give for retention'' requirement be changed so that only consumers

Record evidence indicates that consumers may increase their comparison shopping before selecting a funeral provider
as the marketing of pre-need funeral services increases, because the time constraints surrounding at-need arrangements
are not present to the same degree. See, e.g., Neel, R&hyph;E&hyph;1 at 3.

The Commission has amended &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i) to effect two changes to its original, preventive requirements.
This amendment remedies providers' stated concerns about the timing of the GPL without limiting consumers' ability
to use the information provided by GPL disclosures effectively. First, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``timing''
requirements by breaking down the triggering term ``funeral arrangements'' into its component parts, namely, discussions
of prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific funeral goods or services. This change
should eliminate the apparent provider misinterpretation that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation
of preliminary arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. It clarifies, however,
that discussions about the overall type of service trigger the GPL requirement, and that providers must give the GPL
at the beginning of any discussion involving prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific
funeral goods or services.

Record evidence indicates that some providers have construed the term ``selection'' in the original provision to
mean choosing individual items, such as the casket or vault. See, e.g., F. Hunter, Tr. Vol. I, 801 (``as long as before
they sign the contract, before they look at the caskets and select the vault and the exact kind of funeral''); J. Hunter,
Tr. Vol. III, 604&hyph;605 (``after we have discussed some basic funeral plans, when the arranger has determined
a feel for the families' wishes and desires, and prior to the selection of any services and/or goods''); Pierson, R-G&hyph;1
at 2&hyph;3; Starks, Tr. Vol. II, 402; Franzen, Tr. Vol. II, 818). Other providers are reluctant to discuss the GPL
until price issues are raised. See, e.g., Hocker, Tr. Vol. III, 1435; Johnson, Tr. Vol. I, 744; Starks, Tr. Vol. II,
402&hyph;403; and Hennessy, Tr. Vol. II, 1024.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``distribution'' requirement contained in an original compliance guidelines
interpretation that requires that providers must give consumers the GPL whether discussions occur in the funeral
home ``or elsewhere.'' Record evidence shows that arrangements may occur away from the funeral home premises. However,
the amendment exempts from the GPL requirement in-person provider requests for prior embalming authorization if
the provider makes essentially the same GPL disclosure required by &sect;453.3(a)(1)(ii) of the Rule concerning
the legal necessity for embalming.

Record evidence indicates that providers often may be placed in the uncomfortable position of responding to consumers'
requests to discuss selections during removal of remains. If providers are willing to commit consumers to financial
obligations at that time by making arrangements, record evidence supports consumers' right to receive a GPL. Record
evidence also shows, however, that giving the GPL during removal may be awkward, offensive, and unnecessary if no
other arrangements discussions occur at that time. Such evidence further indicates that a provider's request for
prior embalming authorization, by itself, may be the most potentially offensive situation for both consumers and
funeral directors, because it is a request to perform an intrusive procedure so soon after the survivors' loss.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original and amended Rule resolve this issue for embalming requests made over the telephone by not requiring any
disclosure in that case. But the original Rule required that the GPL must be given if the request is made in person.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If no other selections are made when the provider seeks prior permission, arguably the most important information
consumers need to make an informed response at that time concerns whether embalming is necessary. The required disclosure
that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases should trigger that discussion if the consumer
so desires. The Rule's embalming provisions are predicated on that basis. The amendment simply substitutes the disclosure
of that information for the provision of the entire GPL, to reduce the burden on providers and consumers and to promote
compliance with the Rule. Under the amendment, providers would be in compliance if they either provided a GPL when
seeking prior permission, or made the required embalming disclosure.

5. Fees for Basic (Non-declinable) vs. Other Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.4(b) of the Rule imposes the general legal requirement that consumers' selection of funeral goods and
services be permitted on an itemized basis. However, &sect;453.4(b)(2)(i)(A) permits an exception to that general
right to select. Under that provision, consumers may not decline the basic services of the funeral provider if the
provider so requires. The provision in that event further requires that providers place on the GPL the following statement:
``However, any funeral arrangements you select will include a charge for our services.'' Providers under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)
must also place the following disclosure on the GPL in conjunction with the price for the services of funeral director
and staff, if the fee cannot be declined: ``This fee for our services will be added to the total cost of the funeral arrangements
you select. (This fee is already included in our charge for direct cremations, immediate burials, and forwarding
or receiving remains.)'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission, in promulgating that exception, reasoned that the process of selection itself involves use of the
provider's services, irrespective of the actual goods and services chosen by consumers. The Commission thus permitted
providers to make the services of the funeral provider non-declinable.

The Commission also intended that the non-declinable fee for professional services would include only the charge
for providers' basic services in arranging and planning the funeral, and not charges for services associated with
providing any of the other sixteen items for which itemization is required on the GPL.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
158
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

could not decline under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (the GPL service fee disclosure requirement).

The Commission, however, did not codify in the Rule its intent regarding basic services other than in the definition.
No substantive Rule provision thus clarifies that providers in disclosing itemized fees on the GPL must separate
``basic,'' non-declinable services from services associated with providing the other, declinable GPL goods and
services, including such items as ``use of facilities for viewing,'' and ``use of facilities for funeral ceremony.''
The original staff compliance guidelines for the Rule, as a result, contained lengthy interpretations of the Rule
on that issue, concluding that the non-declinable fee for ``services of funeral director and staff'' may not include
a charge for those services involved in providing any of the other items required to be separately listed on the GPL.
Charges for those services, the Guidelines stated, must be included in the price for each of those items. The Guidelines
further concluded that the non-declinable fee for services may include the services listed in the Rule's definition
of ``services of funeral director and staff.''

 Several public hearing witnesses expressed their view, however, that the original disclosure requirement for the
non-declinable services fee permitted the inclusion of service items that all consumers do not receive with their
arrangements, so that consumers may be paying for services not received,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

impractical or excessively burdensome'' to provide may result in ``non-declinable'' charges under certain conditions.
Generally, however, those items are not considered ``non-declinable'' in the sense that consumers, at the outset
of planning arrangements, have no choice but to purchase them.

Still other witnesses identified another problem with the original services fee disclosure. Those participants

providers in fact appear to include different items in their service fee charges. Price comparison among funeral

 Similarly, Wendell Hahn of the FFDA asserted that providers' inclusion of the cost of providing a special-purpose

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evidence indicates that some providers on their GPLs may not be fully separating non-declinable services from
services associated with providing other items on the GPL. To the extent that is occurring, consumers who decline
other items may be purchasing more services than they actually receive. Other consumers may be ``double charged''
for some services if providers, confused about which services are declinable and which are not, include some portion
of the services associated with declinable items, such as ``use of facilities for viewing,'' in that charge, as well
as the non-declinable services fee. Still other consumers (or groups such as memorial societies that obtain and publish
comparative price data) who attempt to comparison shop may not readily be able to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has concluded that the service disclosure requirements need to be clarified to implement fully the
Commission's intent in permitting a non-declinable services fee. Amendment of the Rule, however, to permit a non-declinable
``basic facilities fee'' charge is not warranted by the evidence or the original Rule requirements. The Rule's core
purpose is to permit itemization so that consumers may select only the funeral items they desire, and decline unwanted
items. The Rule allows providers to recover overhead for facilities by allocating a portion of those costs to each
item offered or by including them in the non-declinable services fee. A second, non-declinable fee would signal a
return to package pricing, where all consumers would pay for the use of all facilities (and, presumably, other overhead
costs) irrespective of the degree to which consumers choose to use them. Itemization permits consumers to decline
the use of various provider facilities. The testimony of at least one funeral director suggested, however, that some
providers currently may be imposing in some form a ``non-declinable'' facilities fee on consumers, in apparent violation
of the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission has adopted the following amendments to clarify the Rule's intent and requirements
with respect to service fees and non-declinable charges: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Revision of the ``services of funeral director and staff'' definition in &sect;453.1(o) to clarify that these
are the basic services that cannot be included in prices of other, declinable GPL categories, and that are furnished
by a funeral provider in arranging any funeral, such as conducting the arrangements conference, planning the funeral,
obtaining necessary permits, and placing obituary notices; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Addition of the term ``basic'' before the word ``services'' where the latter term appears in &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)
(1) and (2) and 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A), so that all GPL disclosures regarding the non-declinable services fee refer to
``basic services'' rather than simply ``services''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Addition of the phrase ``and staff'' after the phrase ``use of facilities'' to &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4) (H) and
(I), to clarify that providers are required to disclose the prices for use of facilities and the services of staff associated
with viewing and a funeral ceremony; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Replacement of the ``other use of facilities'' price disclosure requirement, &sect;453.2(b)(4)(J), with the
more specific disclosures ``use of facilities and staff for memorial service'' and ``use of equipment and staff for
graveside service''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Addition to &sect;453.1 of the definitions of a ``memorial service'' and a ``funeral ceremony'' to distinguish
those services for purposes of listing them separately on the GPL; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Addition of the express requirement to the disclosure requirements of &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (1)
and (2) that, if the services fee cannot be declined, it must include all charges for the recovery of unallocated funeral
provider overhead, and funeral providers may include in the required disclosure (and in the GPL disclosure required
by 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A)) the phrase ``and overhead'' after the word ``services,'' so that disclosures regarding non-declinable
services fees refer to ``basic services,'' and to ``basic services and overhead,'' if providers wish; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Addition of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) to &sect;453.2 to make clear that the Rule permits only one non-declinable fee
for services, facilities or unallocated overhead, unless otherwise required by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments clarify the Commission's intent and providers' obligations in distinguishing non-declinable
service fees from other service charges associated with providing separately listed, declinable goods and services.
The changes are designed to promote industry compliance and consumer understanding of the services they must purchase
and those they may decline, without substantially altering providers' obligations. The amendment permitting providers
to add the phrase ``and overhead'' to the non-declinable service fee disclosure responds to industry's stated concern
that consumers may be deceived by service fee price disclosures that fail to disclose a charge for overhead,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
171
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and clarifies for providers that the non-declinable fee can include overhead not allocated to other charges.

fees include a charge for overhead. Providers may do so under this amendment. See, e.g., P&hyph;37 (NFDA/NSM) at 240&hyph;242;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
173
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the required GPL listing; (2) delete as unnecessary the required GPL disclosure that the GPL does not include
cash advance items, &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i)(D), and move from the GPL to the statement of goods and services selected
the cash advance mark-up disclosure required by &sect;453.3(f)(2);

174
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3) decline to adopt the required use of a ``standardized general price list,'' which the Commission finds is unnecessary
in light of the relatively standardized GPL the Rule now requires, and the amendment, discussed below, prohibiting
any language in any of the Rule-required price lists that alters or contradicts the information provided therein.

 To the extent that the Rule's listing provision has caused providers to charge for acknowledgment cards that were
previously provided free of charge, as funeral provider groups suggested, the Rule may have had the unintended result
of contributing, at least in some small sense, to increased consumer costs. To the extent that the costs are recouped
elsewhere, those costs appear to be so incidental as to be tangential to the Rule's primary purpose. In either case,
the benefits of requiring acknowledgment cards on the GPL appear to be outweighed by the harm to funeral providers'
reputations and consumer satisfaction. The Commission thus has concluded that the better course is to remove the
provision from the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no record evidence to support, however, a general right for the provider to list any of the other items now required
to be on the GPL as ``no charge'' items, as industry groups suggested. The Commission is concerned, for example, that
if the Rule were to permit the listing of embalming or transportation as ``no charge'' items, their costs, which can
amount to several hundreds of dollars, would be recovered in the prices of other items. As a result, consumers would,
in effect, not have the opportunity to decline the costs associated with important items. Such a change could thus
result in the diminution of itemization and the return of package-only pricing, which the Rule was primarily designed
to prevent. See the discussion at R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR), 172&hyph;173.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.3 of the Rule currently requires funeral providers to make specific written disclosures on the price
lists and the itemized statement of goods and services selected. The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and
Purpose determined that, due to funeral providers' false claims or failure to disclose accurate information, many
consumers erroneously believed that certain procedures (such as embalming) or particular goods (such as caskets
for cremation and outer burial containers) were required purchases not subject to individual choice, and that goods
and services had certain protective and preservative qualities when such was not the case.

R-B&hyph;5 at 42274&hyph;42279. Although the record did not contain evidence that certain misrepresentations
(such as the protective and preservative claims of goods and the requirement of a casket for cremation) were widespread,
the Commission determined that their inclusion in the Rule was necessary because of their pernicious nature, or because
of the substantial, potential cost that could be incurred by consumers who make purchase decisions based upon incorrect
assumptions of material facts. Id. at 42276&hyph;42278.

Section 453.3 thus declares that it is a deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to misrepresent: embalming
requirements, casket for cremation requirements,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
177
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 outer burial container requirements, legal and cemetery requirements, preservative and protective value of funeral
goods and services, and cash advance charges. The provisions of &sect;453.3 were designed to prevent those deceptive
practices and to correct consumers' misconceptions by requiring written disclosures on both the price lists and
the itemized statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has determined, however, that the record does not provide a substantial basis to repeal the twelve
affirmative disclosures. Although the empirical data indicate that consumers' knowledge has increased somewhat
under the Rule, and that some misrepresentations have declined, the data also show that misrepresentations are still
occurring, particularly in areas where consumer knowledge is still low, such as embalming. The evidence further
demonstrates that consumer knowledge of funeral requirements and products is still at a minimal level. Viewed together,
those facts warrant the retention of the disclosure provisions.

 Nor is there sufficient evidence to warrant an amendment allowing funeral providers to use their own disclosure language.

that they may only be charged for those items selected or for items that are required by law. If purchases are required
by law or otherwise, this provision further provides consumers with an explanation in writing, together with the
reason the requirement applies to their selections. The provision was intended to provide consumers with a final
reminder that they need only pay for items that they have selected.

use of such price information by making a decision to decline items which they do not wish to purchase.'').

The Commission has amended the required language in order to clarify for consumers the original purpose of the provision.
It alerts consumers that they may only be charged for the goods and services that they choose, or that are required by
law or by a cemetery or crematory (such as an outer burial container or a certain type of alternative container).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission further adopts a technical change to &sect;453.6 concerning providers' retention of documents,
to clarify its requirements. The original section required the funeral provider to retain a copy of the ``signed''
statement of goods and services selected. The Rule, however, does not contain any express requirement that the final
statement be signed, either by the consumer or the provider. The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose
made no mention of the signature requirement. Earlier drafts of the Rule included a requirement that the funeral provider
ask the consumer to sign the itemized statement, but it was not adopted in the final version. The ``signed'' language
of &sect;453.6 was apparently inserted to complement the earlier draft of the Rule that contained the itemized statement
requirement; however, when the signature requirement was deleted, the language of &sect;453.6 was inadvertently
left intact. This language, however, is susceptible to different interpretations, and may lead some funeral providers
to believe that they must obtain the signature of the consumer on the statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission therefore has amended the language of &sect;453.6 by deleting the phrase ``on which the statement
was signed,'' and substituting the phrase ``of the arrangements conference,'' so that the provision now requires
providers to maintain a copy of each statement of funeral goods and services selected ``for at least one year from the
date of the arrangements conference.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in addition, has added clarifying language to the required ``clear and conspicuous'' disclosure
standard contained in &sect;453.7 of the Rule. That language clarifies that providers may not add statements or information
to the Rule-required price lists that alter or contradict the information required to be included in those lists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This specific prohibition is necessary to prevent violations of the ``clear and conspicuous'' standard that relate
to provider detraction and potential consumer confusion problems demonstrated in the record.

Finally, the Commission has: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Deleted the definition of ``Accounting year'' (&sect;453.1(a)), because that phrase does not appear elsewhere
in the Rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) amended the definition of a ``casket'' (&sect;453.1(d)), to include those constructed of ``fiberglass'' and
``plastic'', because those types of caskets represent a significant portion of caskets produced in today's market;

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) made a slight grammatical change to the definition of ``Funeral services'' (&sect;453.1(j)), to make it clear
that the Rule only covers services that involve both the preparation of remains and the supervision of disposition.

A. Final Regulatory and Regulatory Flexibility Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined that these amendments to the Funeral Rule will not have an annual effect on the national
economy of $100 million or more, or otherwise have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business.
The preponderance of the evidence in the record indicates that the Rule overall has not significantly increased funeral
providers' costs of doing business, and that the amendments will reduce any costs to providers imposed by the Rule's
requirements, by making it easier for them to comply. Therefore, pursuant to the exception for Rule amendments contained
in section 22(a)(1)(A) of the FTC Act, and the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604, 605, section
22 of the Act requiring that the Commission issue a final regulatory analysis with the promulgation of a final rule
does not apply to this amended Rule.

In selling or offering to sell funeral goods or funeral services to the public, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice
for a funeral provider to fail to furnish accurate price information disclosing the cost to the purchaser for each
of the specific funeral goods and funeral services used in connection with the disposition of deceased human bodies,
including at least the price of embalming, transportation of remains, use of facilities, caskets, outer burial containers,
immediate burials, or direct cremations, to persons inquiring about the purchase of funerals. Any funeral provider
who complies with the preventive requirements in paragraph (b) of this section is not engaged in the unfair or deceptive
acts or practices defined here.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent these unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as well as the unfair or deceptive acts or practices defined
in &sect;453.4(b)(1), funeral providers must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Telephone price disclosure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tell persons who ask by telephone about the funeral provider's offerings or prices any accurate information from
the price lists described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section and any other readily available information
that reasonably answers the question.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Give a printed or typewritten price list to people who inquire in person about the offerings or prices of caskets
or alternative containers. The funeral provider must offer the list upon beginning discussion of, but in any event
before showing caskets. The list must contain at least the retail prices of all caskets and alternative containers
offered which do not require special ordering, enough information to identify each, and the effective date for the
price list. In lieu of a written list, other formats, such as notebooks, brochures, or charts may be used if they contain
the same information as would the printed or typewritten list, and display it in a clear and conspicuous manner. Provided,
however, that funeral providers do not have to make a casket price list available if the funeral providers place on
the general price list, specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the information required by this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Place on the list, however produced, the name of the funeral provider's place of business and a caption describing

special ordering, enough information to identify each container, and the effective date for the prices listed. In
lieu of a written list, the funeral provider may use other formats, such as notebooks, brochures, or charts, if they
contain the same information as the printed or typewritten list, and display it in a clear and conspicuous manner.
Provided, however, that funeral providers do not have to make an outer burial container price list available if the
funeral providers place on the general price list, specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the information
required by this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i)(A) Give a printed or typewritten price list for retention to persons who inquire in person about the funeral goods,
funeral services or prices of funeral goods or services offered by the funeral provider. The funeral provider must
give the list upon beginning discussion of any of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Specific funeral goods or funeral services offered by the funeral provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The requirement in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section applies whether the discussion takes place in the funeral
home or elsewhere. Provided, however, that when the deceased is removed for transportation to the funeral home, an
in-person request at that time for authorization to embalm, required by &sect;453.5(a)(2), does not, by itself,
trigger the requirement to offer the general price list if the provider in seeking prior embalming approval discloses
that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases, if any. Any other discussion during that time
about prices or the selection of funeral goods or services triggers the requirement under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)
of this section to give consumers a general price list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) State or local law or regulation requires embalming in the particular circumstances regardless of any funeral
choice which the family might make; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Prior approval for embalming (expressly so described) has been obtained from a family member or other authorized
person; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The funeral provider is unable to contact a family member or other authorized person after exercising due diligence,
has no reason to believe the family does not want embalming performed, and obtains subsequent approval for embalming
already performed (expressly so described). In seeking approval, the funeral provider must disclose that a fee will
be charged if the family selects a funeral which requires embalming, such as a funeral with viewing, and that no fee
will be charged if the family selects a service which does not require embalming, such as direct cremation or immediate
burial.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise the United States Standards for Grades of Apricots. The proposal would specify definitions
that do not appear in the standard but are described in the inspection handbooks and bring up to date any obsolete terms
and definitions. In addition, the proposed rule will provide metric equivalents for dimensions given in terms of
U.S. Customary units and contains conforming and editorial changes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule for the revision of U.S. Standards for
Grades of Apricots will not impose substantial direct economic cost, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes
on small entities, and will not alter the market share or competitive position of these entities relative to large
businesses. In addition, under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, the use of these standards is voluntary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must
be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies periodically review existing regulations. An objective of the review is to ensure that the grade standards
are serving their intended purpose, the language is clear, and the standards are consistent with AMS policy and authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States Standards for Grades of Apricots became effective on May 25, 1928 and has not been revised since then.
In June 1992, the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee (WAMC) requested the USDA to revise the standard. Consisting
of producers from various districts throughout the State, the WAMC recommends minimum size, pack, and grade requirements
each year for the Federal Marketing Order on Washington State grown apricots. Specifically, the WAMC requested that
skin breaks (cuts and stem punctures), and stem pulls be changed from ``free from'' defects to ``free from damage''
or ``serious damage'' defects in the U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 grades, respectively. Such changes would have the effect
of allowing these defects on fruit in various degrees without being scored against the grade (versus ``free from''
which means they are scored on sight). WAMC also suggested that the Department should make any other revisions deemed
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMS reviewed these issues to ascertain the need for the change proposed by WAMC as well as other technical changes or
updates that the Agency believes may be helpful. Many suggestions and comments were received pertaining to a recent
informal market survey by AMS. The California Apricot Advisory Board advised AMS that the changes proposed pertaining
to skinbreaks and stem pulls are not warranted and would allow the export of otherwise unsaleable product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it would appear that there is not a widespread consensus among interested parties that skin breaks, stem
punctures or similar defects should be allowed in these grades. However, in order for the Department to receive comments
in a more widespread and formal manner this requested change as well as the following changes by the Department which
would bring the standard up to date with current industry practices, are being proposed.

Sections 51.2925 and 51.2926 are proposed to be revised to remove cuts and skin breaks as free from defects (and change
them to free from damage and serious damage defects, respectively). According to the Washington Apricot Marketing
Committee, the ``Washington Apricot industry has had difficulty in meeting the U.S. Grade Standards for Apricots
with regard to `skin breaks.' This has caused a great deal of hardship as the industry attempts to make sales into Canada.
Over the past year members of the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee have been expressing a desire to gain some
sort of relief from the strict interpretation of the `free from' portion of the grade standards. The real problem,
as our industry sees it, is that there is no definition of what constitutes `damage' and `serious damage' relative
to `skin breaks' and/or `punctures.' Consequently, all of these types of defects are scored no matter how small or
insignificant they might be.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that &sect;&sect;51.2925 and 51.2926 be revised to include bruises as a specified defect. Bruising
is a prevalent defect on apricots that should have specific areas designated which constitute damage and serious
damage. Presently, this defect is scored based on the general definitions for damage and serious damage. It is proposed
that any bruise causing discoloration exceeding the area of a circle three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter or one-eighth
inch (3.1 mm) in depth (damage) or five-eighths inch (15.9 mm) in diameter or three-sixteenths inch (4.8 mm) in depth
(serious damage), or an aggregate of lesser bruises detracting from the appearance, edible or shipping quality of
the apricot as much as the depth or area requirements previously mentioned be scored against the grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51.2926a Unclassified is being removed. Unclassified is not a grade in itself but was simply a designation
for apricots that do not meet any grade requirement. However, it is often mistaken as an actual grade. Since the designation
is rarely used and may create some confusion in the market place it should be discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that paragraph (c) Description of Pack of &sect;51.2927 be removed. This paragraph provides for pack
designations in 4-basket crates. Apricots are seldom, if ever, packed in these types of containers for today's markets.
Therefore, this paragraph is no longer needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) Tolerance would also be removed. This paragraph allows a tolerance for offsize specimens. The proposed
rule would make referencing of these tolerances easier and bring the format into conformity with more recent standards
by establishing a separate ``Tolerances'' section. This new section, 51.2928 would respecify not only the size tolerances
which are being removed from paragraph (d), but would also apply tolerances to packages marked according to count,
and defect tolerances as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51.2928 Mature is revised so that the definition of mature does not contain the word as part of the definition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously mentioned a new section which would now be designated &sect;51.2928 Tolerances, would list all applicable
tolerances for the grades. Other than the provision for packages marked according to count, there are no new tolerances
proposed in this section. Rather than scatter the tolerances under different sections throughout the standard,
they have been grouped together under one section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new section, 51.2929 Application of Tolerances, is being proposed. This section will designate a limit on excessively
high defect percentages for an individual sample which, if exceeded, would cause the lot to fail to grade even though
the average of these defects may be within the lot tolerances provided. It is proposed that for lot tolerances of ten
percent or more, individual samples may not contain more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified, and
for tolerances of less than 10 percent, individual samples may contain not more than double the tolerance specified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general definition for damage would be revised to reflect that which is currently used in most other standards.
It also specifies that the dimensions provided for defect limits are based on an apricot one and seven-eighths inches
(4.8 cm) in diameter, and correspondingly lesser or greater dimensions are allowed for smaller or larger sized apricots.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new section (51.2932) proposed for damage, each defect is listed as a separate paragraph. New definitions
under this section include dirt, scab, scale hail, skin breaks, stem pulls, and bruises. All specifications except
for bruises, skin breaks, and stem pulls are taken from the inspection handbook on scoring these defects under the
general definitions of damage and serious damage. The scoring for skin breaks and stem pulls was recommended by WAMC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that scale occurring as scale insects, scale marks, or similar marks which are heavily concentrated
or are scattered and aggregating more than one-fourth inch (6.3 mm) in diameter (damage) or one-half inch (12.7 mm)
in diameter (serious damage); scab spot when cracked or aggregating more than three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter
in the aggregate (damage) or when the skin has been broken or when more than three-sixteenths of an inch (4.8 mm) deep
or more than one-half inch (12.7 mm) in diameter in the aggregate (serious damage); and bruises when any bruise causes
discoloration exceeding the area of a circle three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter or one-eighth inch (3.1 mm) in
depth (damage) or when any bruise causes discoloration exceeding the area of a circle five-eighths inch (15.9 mm)
in diameter or three-sixteenths (4.8 mm) in depth; skin breaks in the form of cuts and punctures which exceed individually
or in the aggregate, an area equivalent to a circle three-sixteenths inch (4.8 mm) in diameter (damage) or three-eighths
inch (9.6 mm) in diameter (serious damage); stem pulls which exceed an area equivalent to a circle three-eighths inch
(9.6 mm) in diameter (damage) or one-half inch (12.7 mm) in diameter (serious damage); be specified as definitions
under the appropriate sections.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the 1993 Act) was enacted on August 10, 1993. Section 1106 of the 1993
Act amended the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (the 1938 Act) by adding new section 320C that imposes a domestic
tobacco content requirement for cigarettes made in the United States by any ``domestic manufacturer of cigarettes''
as defined in the 1938 Act. Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, each such manufacturer of cigarettes must certify
the percentage of tobacco produced in the United States which was used by the manufacturer to produce cigarettes during
the preceding calendar year. If the percentage of United States produced tobacco used by a domestic manufacturer
of cigarettes in the manufacture of cigarettes is less than 75 percent, the manufacturer will be subject to a domestic
marketing assessment and must purchase a quantity of tobacco from inventories of the producer owned burley and flue-cured
cooperative marketing associations in an amount equal to the quantity of imported tobacco used by the manufacturer
to produce cigarettes during the preceding calendar year that exceeds 25 percent of the total quantity of tobacco
used in such cigarette production. When a manufacturer is subject to a domestic content marketing assessment, the
assessment rate will be based on the amount by which 1/2 the sum of the average prices per pound received during the most
recent marketing year, by producers of domestically produced burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively,
exceeds the average price per pound paid for unmanufactured imported tobacco during the preceding calendar year.
This proposed rule would amend the regulations to implement the provisions of section 320C.

This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on a preliminary regulatory impact
analysis, this proposed rule has been determined to be economically significant. To obtain a copy of the Preliminary
Regulatory Impact Statement, contact Dr. Robert Miller, Director, Tobacco and Peanut Analysis Division, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, P. O. Box 2415, Washington, DC
20013&hyph;2415, telephone (202) 720&hyph;8839.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 75 percent domestic tobacco content requirement is expected to increase the usage of domestic tobacco by 188 million
pounds for 1994 which will cost domestic manufacturers about $200 million. Since the cost of domestic tobacco is about
double that of imported tobacco, domestic cigarette manufacturers are expected to shift cigarette production to
foreign based operations. As this shift in production occurs, domestic cigarette production is expected to decline
about 9 percent a year for the next four years. This will result in the loss of about 11,000 jobs in domestic cigarette
manufacturing plants. The use of domestically produced tobacco will eventually decline to a level less than if there
were no domestic content requirement. Domestic cigarette output is expected to decline about 40 percent by 1998.
The impact statement indicates little effect on the consumer prices for cigarettes because the tobacco accounts
for only about 3 percent of the cost of cigarettes. The regulatory impact analysis does not consider any effects that
an increase in cigarette excise tax may have on domestic cigarette production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial increase in the use of domestic tobacco is expected to draw down current loan stocks of burley and flue-cured
tobacco. This will benefit tobacco producers in the short term since the Commodity Credit Corporation's net loan
outlays for the 1994 marketing year are estimated to be about $380 million less as a result of the domestic tobacco content
requirement. This will reduce the amount of the no-net-cost assessments paid by producers and purchasers of tobacco.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the cigarette manufacturing sector, this proposed regulatory action is not expected to have an adverse
effect on the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. This regulatory
action is not expected to be inconsistent nor interfere with an action taken or planned by another federal agency.
Other than as indicated in the summary of the regulatory impact statement, this action would not alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of the recipients thereof.
This proposed rule would be consistent with the President's priorities and principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.

Summary of Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 320B of the 1938 Act imposes certain requirements on ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' and those
manufacturers are defined in section 301 of the 1938 Act to be those that produce and sell at least one percent of the
cigarettes produced and sold in the United States. Section 320B requires that those manufacturers specify each year,
in advance, their expected purchases of burley and flue-cured tobacco. The sanction for failing to do so accurately,
within certain limits, is that the manufacturer must pay an additional assessment to offset the cost of the Federal
tobacco program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 320C provides for additional requirements that must be met by ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes''
to avoid additional assessments. The provisions of section 320C are set out in greater detail below in the description
of the content and organization of the proposed rule. Generally, under section 320C manufacturers who are ``domestic
manufacturers of cigarettes'' must certify each year the percentage of U.S. tobacco used in their cigarettes. If
more than 25 percent is imported tobacco, the manufacturer must pay an assessment. Also, if this limit is exceeded,
the manufacturer must make compensatory purchases of tobacco from the burley and flue-cured producer loan associations
and may be required to pay a penalty for failing to make such compensatory purchases in a timely manner. Under section
320C(f), the 75/25 ratio may be reduced if the Secretary determines that U.S. tobacco supply conditions warrant a
reduction due to conditions beyond the control of producers. Also, section 320C requires that manufacturers file
reports and maintain records as specified by the Secretary to enforce that section. Failure to file required reports
or maintain records, or the submission of false information can lead to criminal penalties as well as other sanctions.
Other new provisions concerning assessments on imported tobacco enacted in the 1993 Act will be implemented in a separate
rule.

Coverage of the Proposed Rule; Definition of Tobacco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The 75/25 ratio is referred to in the rule as the ``domestic content requirement.'' Since this requirement is a calendar
year requirement under section 320C, the proposed rule would apply the requirement first in 1994. The authorizing
statute was enacted well into 1993. There is nothing in the Act to provide for making the provisions retroactive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement applies only to ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes.'' The statute does not limit, as such, the
content requirement to cigarettes produced by those manufacturers in the United States. The fact that section 320C
applies the requirement only to certain ``domestic'' manufacturers, and given other provisions of section 320C,
the proposed rule limits the coverage to cigarettes produced by subject manufacturers in the United States. For that
purpose, the rule defines ``United States,'' consistent with section 301 of the 1938 Act, to be the fifty States, the
territories of the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. With respect to limiting coverage to domestic
production, section 320C(b) provides that the sanctions in 320C(c), (d), and (e) will apply when the use of ``imported
tobacco'' exceeds 25 percent. Tobacco becomes ``imported'' only by reference to a domestic market. Hence, it appears
clear that the statute was intended to cover only domestic production of cigarettes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The domestic content requirement requires counting all the ``tobacco'' in the cigarettes and computing the amount
of ``imported tobacco'' in those cigarettes. The 1938 Act covers many commodities, including tobacco. Until recently
the tobacco provisions of the 1938 Act dealt mainly with regulating the production of tobacco by domestic producers
and the definition of ``tobacco'' in section 301 of the 1938 Act, which is made generally applicable to the entire 1938
Act, appears to have been drafted accordingly when it was enacted in 1938. The term ``tobacco'' is used in section 320C
without a modifier and in combination with the word ``imported.'' Tobacco is classified by kind and by type number.
For example, domestic burley tobacco is commonly referred to as type 31. Section 301 refers to the ``Service and Regulatory
Announcement 118 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Bureau of Agricultural Economics'' published in 1929
and defines tobacco to mean certain specified tobacco types by type number as identified in Announcement 118. All
of the identified types, however, are identified in Announcement 118 as domestic tobaccos. Foreign tobaccos are
assigned other type numbers and, thus, under the section 301 definition, they technically would not appear to be,
``tobacco'' at all under that definition. However, section 320C clearly was intended to measure the amount of use
of ``imported tobacco,'' as those words would be defined in their common meaning as compared with domestic tobacco
use. Use of the section 301 definition of ``tobacco'' would make that comparison impossible and make the statute essentially
meaningless. Thus, the proposed rule presumes that the Congress did not intend for the section 301 definition of ``tobacco''
to be used for the section 320C purpose. The proposed rule has been drafted accordingly. ``Tobacco'' is defined in
the proposed rule to mean that which is commonly considered to be ``tobacco'' in the trade. As there is no provision
in the statute to do otherwise, that would include all foreign tobacco, including those like Turkish and Oriental
tobaccos, which may not have as close a domestic counterpart as other tobaccos. This inclusion is consistent with
the Conference report issued with the 1993 Act (H. Conf. Report No. 103&hyph;213) where the Conference managers stated
their belief that the 75/25 ratio, by allowing the maintenance of current blends, would be sufficient to ``permit
the continued importation of Turkish and Oriental tobaccos.'' If Turkish and Oriental tobaccos were not subject
to section 320C, the ratio would be irrelevant. These conclusions, as with all aspects of the proposed rule, are subject
to further consideration on receipt of comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A ``domestic manufacturer of cigarettes'' is defined in section 301(b)(17) of the 1938 Act as ``a person that produces
and sells more than 1 percent of the cigarettes produced and sold in the United States.'' To avoid the domestic marketing
assessment and other sanctions imposed by section 320C of the amended 1938 Act, beginning in 1994 and each succeeding
calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes must use at least 75 percent domestically grown tobacco
in the cigarettes manufactured by such manufacturer. In determining compliance with the domestic content requirement,
the proposed rule specifies that imported tobacco will include all tobacco imported into the United States including
Oriental and Turkish tobaccos. The domestic tobacco content requirement will apply to all cigarettes manufactured
in the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes without regard to whether the manufactured cigarettes
are sold domestically or exported. The domestic content requirement would not apply to cigarettes manufactured
outside the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes. Likewise, the domestic tobacco content requirement
would not apply to tobacco processed in the United States for use in making cigarettes outside the United States. Domestic
manufacturers of cigarettes with operations located outside the United States would not be required to file reports
for cigarettes manufactured in such foreign based operations for foreign-made cigarettes and the domestic content
rules would not apply to such cigarettes.

2. Reports and Certifications by Domestic Manufacturers of Cigarettes (&sect;723.502) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the proposed rule, beginning with the 1994 and each succeeding calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of
cigarettes would be required to maintain records, file reports and certify to the quantities of domestic and imported
tobacco used by such manufacturer to manufacture cigarettes in the United States. Determinations as to content percentages
would be based on the weight of the tobacco when it is ready for the cigarette manufacturing process. Adjustments,
to avoid double-counting, will be made for any tobacco which loses its identity during the manufacturing process
and is recaptured and reused to manufacture cigarettes by the same manufacturer and for tobacco in any cigarettes
returned to the manufacturer and reused by such manufacturer to manufacture other cigarettes. Such adjustments
will be made only to the extent that records are maintained which prove the reuse of such tobacco. For the purpose of
determining the domestic content percentage, any tobacco reconstituted, or otherwise processed, so as to lose its
respective identity as either imported tobacco or domestic tobacco, before being acquired by a domestic manufacturer
of cigarettes shall be considered to be imported tobacco when it is used to produce cigarettes by a domestic manufacturer
of cigarettes. The proposed rule provides that reports and certifications must be mailed or otherwise delivered
to Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, U. S. Department
of Agriculture, P. O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415 by February 15 of the year after the calendar year for
which reports and certifications apply. Failure to file timely reports or make required certifications will result
in all tobacco used by the manufacturer in the manufacturing of cigarettes in the United States being considered as
imported tobacco and sanctions would be applied accordingly. Such a presumption is provided for in section 320C(b)
of the 1938 Act.

3. Domestic Marketing Assessment and Required Purchases of Tobacco (&sect;&sect;723.503 and 723.504) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 320C(c) of the Act provides that if the quantity of imported tobacco used by a domestic manufacturer for making
cigarettes for the year exceeds 25 percent, such manufacturer must pay a domestic marketing assessment on each pound
of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent. In addition, as provided in section 320C(d) and (e), such manufacturer
must purchase tobacco from the existing burley and flue-cured tobacco inventories of producer owned cooperative
marketing associations in an amount equal to the weight of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per pound domestic marketing assessment rate set by section 320C(c) is the difference between one-half the sum
of the average market prices received by domestic producers of burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively,
and the average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco. Domestically produced burley and flue-cured tobaccos
are marketed on a marketing year basis. The average price per pound paid to domestic producers for a kind of tobacco
is determined for the marketing year. The marketing years are: for burley tobacco, October 1 through September 30;
and for flue-cured tobacco, July 1 through June 30. Under the proposed rule, the average prices for domestically produced
burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco would be calculated using data published by the Department of Agriculture's
National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). For the other side of the comparison, a weighted average price
of all unmanufactured tobacco imported for consumption in the United States, with no allowance for tobacco reexported,
would be calculated from Bureau of Census data. For example, if the calculated average market prices were $1.83 per
pound for burley tobacco and $1.73 per pound for flue-cured tobacco, the average price would be $1.78 per pound. If
the weighted average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco for the relevant period was $1.28 per pound, a domestic
marketing assessment rate of $0.50 per pound would apply. That rate would be multiplied by the pounds of imported tobacco
used in excess of the 25 percent limit (unless a higher limit had been set under the Secretary's discretionary authority
to adjust the limit as provided for in section 320C(f)). If noncompliance is indicated, the cigarette manufacturer
will have an opportunity for an administrative hearing before any domestic marketing assessments or other sanctions
are imposed. Under the proposed rule payment of the assessment would be required to be made within 30 days after the
manufacturer is notified of the amount due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a domestic content violation has occurred, the compensatory purchases of tobacco by a manufacturer, as required
by section 320C(d) and (e), must be in equal quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco and must be from the inventories
of producer owned cooperative marketing associations that handle price support loans for tobacco. However, the
statute provides that if the total required compensatory purchases by all noncomplying manufacturers would reduce
the associations inventories of loan stocks of burley or flue-cured tobacco below the reserve stock level for the
respective kind of tobacco, the required purchase of such kind of tobacco, for each manufacturer, may be reduced proportionately.
These provisions of section 320C would be implemented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;723.504 of the proposed rule. The required purchases of burley tobacco could be made from either of the two producer
owned marketing associations for burley tobacco: the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association and the Burley
Stabilization Corporation. There is only one applicable producer association for flue-cured tobacco, the Flue-Cured
Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation. Under the proposed rule, required purchases of tobacco must be
at the applicable list price published by the association without discounts of any kind. The manufacturer would be
allowed to make such purchases from any grade or grades of uncommitted tobacco in the association's inventories.
Compensatory purchases of tobacco would be required to be made within 30 days after the manufacturer is notified of
the quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco that must be purchased. However, the time could be extended if the
manufacturer requests reconsideration of the compensatory purchase determination. As provided in sections 320C
(d) and (e) of the statute, if a manufacturer fails to make the required compensatory purchases in a timely manner,
the manufacturer, under the proposed rule, would be subject to a penalty of 75 percent of the average market price for
the applicable kind of tobacco for the most recent marketing year multiplied by the quantity of tobacco involved.
Further, as provided in sections 320C(d)(5) and (e)(5), these compensatory purchases could not be counted by the
manufacturer for purchases in the application of section 320B of the 1938 Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 320C(f) provides that the Secretary may reduce the 75 percent domestic content requirement for a calendar
year following a crop loss if the Secretary, in consultation with the producer owned tobacco associations, determines
that: (1) Because of drought, insect or disease infestation, or other natural disaster or other conditions beyond
the control of producers, the total quantity of a crop of domestic burley or flue-cured tobacco which is harvested
and suitable for marketing is substantially less than the expected production for the crop and (2) loan stock inventories
for the kind of tobacco have been depleted. Under the proposed rule, the expected production would be calculated based
on the planted acreage of the kind of tobacco, as reported by the NASS, multiplied by the average of the 5 most recent
years' average yields per acre as published by the NASS for that kind of tobacco. The loan stock inventory of a kind of
tobacco would be considered to be depleted if the Secretary, in consultation with the associations, concluded that
the loan stock inventories at the beginning of the next marketing year for such kind of tobacco would not likely exceed
25 percent of the reserve stock level. Under the proposed rule, the Secretary would make the determination to announce
any reduced percentage for the domestic content requirement by November 30 of the year preceding the year of the reduction.
Under the proposed rule, the Secretary's authority for making the determinations on reducing the domestic content
percentage would be delegated to the Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division.

Section 320C(b) of the 1938 Act requires that manufacturers maintain records and make such reports as are necessary
to show compliance with the domestic tobacco content requirement. That section also provides that the Secretary
and the USDA Office of Inspector General may examine such records and other matters as the Secretary has reason to believe
may be relevant and that the Secretary may charge a fee to the manufacturer for the reasonable cost of any such examination.
Section 320C(b) provides, as well, that any person who fails to provide requested information or provides false information
shall be subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001 which, generally, provides that persons who knowingly and willfully supply false
or misleading information, or cover up information, on matters within the jurisdiction of federal agencies, may
be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned up to five years. Section 320C(b) also provides that information submitted regarding
cigarette content and levels of production will be exempt from disclosure to other members of the public under the
Freedom of Information Act provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552. These provisions of section 320C are implemented in &sect;723.506
through &sect;723.508 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, with respect to records and reports, manufacturers would be required, at a minimum, to file
reports and maintain records concerning the kind, quantity, form (stemmed, unstemmed, reconstituted, etc.), and
country of origin of all tobacco which is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In inventory at the beginning of the calendar year, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(4) Disposed of other than through the manufacture of cigarettes in the United States during the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Separate records would be required for each lot, batch, or blend that is used to manufacture cigarettes. These records
would be required to indicate the quantity of tobacco by category, domestic or import, and the total quantity of tobacco
for each specific lot, batch, or run of tobacco. Regarding confidentiality, while the provisions of the statute controls
disclosure of information regarding individual manufacturers, summary statistical data and general statements
that are not related to a specific cigarette manufacturer could be released.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Multiplying the required percentage of domestic content by the total pounds of tobacco used to produce cigarettes
during the applicable calendar year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subtracting the pounds of domestic tobacco used in such cigarettes from the result determined in paragraph (c)(1)
of this section, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Multiplying the result determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a positive number, by the assessment
rate determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time for paying assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The manufacturer shall pay the domestic marketing assessment provided for in this section within 30 calendar days
after demand for payment. However, if the manufacturer timely requests reconsideration or timely appeals the determination,
the time for payment of the amount in dispute may be extended by the Director to a date no later than 30 calendar days after
the final determination is rendered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to paying a domestic marketing assessment, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes who fails to comply
with &sect;723.502, as determined by the Director, shall purchase a quantity of burley and flue-cured tobacco from
the loan stocks of the producer owned cooperative marketing associations as provided in this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purchase quantity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amount of tobacco that must be purchased shall be an amount equal to the amount of imported tobacco on which the assessment
in &sect;723.503 can be levied. The total amount of required purchases shall be divided equally between burley and
flue-cured tobacco. If it is determined that the required amount of purchases by all manufacturers would reduce the
inventories of burley or flue-cured tobacco below the reserve stock level, the Director may reduce the required purchase
quantity on a pro rata basis. Required purchases under this section shall not be considered as purchases for purposes
of meeting the manufacturer's purchase intentions under section 320B of the 1938 Act.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purchase price.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to receive credit for a purchase to satisfy a purchase required by this section, the purchase price must not
be less than published offer list price of the applicable producer cooperative marketing association. Credit for
required purchases shall not be allowed if discounts, rebates, or other special incentives have been offered and
received in connection with purchases of tobacco loan stocks from association inventories.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each manufacturer shall have 30 calendar days from date of notification of the required purchase amount to complete
the purchases required under this section. The producer cooperative marketing association shall report to the Director
the quantities of required purchases that have been made. A manufacturer who fails to purchase within the allotted
time the required quantity of burley or flue-cured tobacco shall be liable for penalty on each pound of tobacco for
which there has been a failure to make a timely purchase. The penalty rate shall be the amount determined to be equal
to 75 percent of the average market price for the kind of tobacco required to be purchased for the year preceding the
year of the violation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Director, in consultation with the producer owned cooperative marketing associations, may reduce the domestic
content level to a percentage below 75 percent for any calendar year, when the Director determines that the production
of burley or flue-cured tobacco for the preceding year was substantially reduced because of natural disaster or other
conditions beyond the control of producers for the immediately preceding crop year and that the loan stock inventory
for the kind of tobacco involved will be depleted to 25 percent of the reserve stock level for that kind of tobacco.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Secretary Espy announced in late May 1993 that he was requesting the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to present
him with a plan for making the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system of process control mandatory
in all the Nation's federally inspected meat and poultry establishments. At the Secretary's direction to ensure
greater input from all constituent and other interests, it was determined by FSIS that it would be beneficial to provide
all constituent groups with a forum to comment on development of a mandatory HACCP system. Therefore, FSIS announces
that a HACCP Round Table discussion will be held.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS views this Round Table as an opportunity to allow free and frank discussion of the legitimate concerns of all constituents
prior to the issuance of a proposed regulation on HACCP. This meeting is envisioned as a substantive opportunity to
assist FSIS through a thorough discussion of the issues regarding HACCP. This will aid FSIS when it begins drafting
the rule for implementing a HACCP system of production in all meat and poultry establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Round Table will be facilitated by a neutral third party. The facilitator will seek the full participation of all
Round Table participants, will ensure that all identified issues are addressed by the Round Table participants,
and will invite comments at the end of the Round Table. After the Round Table meeting, the facilitator will provide
a transcript of the meeting, and will prepare a final report, which will include any comments submitted at the Round
Table meeting and will summarize the positions of all Round Table participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Round Table meeting will be open to the public. Issue papers will be prepared in advance of the meeting by the participants,
and will be publicly available through the FSIS hearing clerk. All issues relative to a HACCP system shall be open for
consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has preliminarily identified the following categories of constituents:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meat and Poultry Industry and Their Representatives (Including Grocers and Retailers)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consumers and Their Representatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and identify his or her constituent category, to Mr. Mark Manis whose address and phone number appear in this notice
in the paragraph entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, within 2 weeks of the date of the publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the 2-week notification period, FSIS will: (1) Compile a list, for each category, of those who expressed an
interest in participating in the Round Table meeting; and (2) share that list, by category, with the members of each
category. FSIS will then request, within 2 weeks after sending the list to members of each category, that the members
of each category select representatives to serve as both Round Table and Steering Committee participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure the effectiveness of this process, the estimated number of Round Table participants will be between 25 and
30, and the total number of attendees will be determined by the capacity of the meeting room. FSIS will request each
constituent category to appoint one representative to serve on the Steering Committee. FSIS will request that five
representatives be appointed for the Round Table by each of the following constituent categories: Meat and Poultry
Industry and Their Representatives; Consumers and Their Representatives; and Scientists and Professional Scientific
Organizations. FSIS will request that four representatives be appointed for the Round Table from the Producers and
Farmers category. FSIS will request that three representatives be appointed for the Round Table from the FSIS Employees
and Their Representatives; and Federal, State, and Local Governments categories. FSIS will request that two representatives
be appointed for the Round Table from the Public Health Officials and Medical Doctors category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any constituent category is unable to designate its representatives, USDA will assist in the selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, any person who believes that an affected interest is not represented by the identified categories of
constituent groups may request, within 2 weeks of the date of publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, Round Table participation for that affected interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the representatives are appointed, FSIS will convene a Steering Committee to be held in the Washington, DC, area
in advance of the Round Table meeting. The Steering Committee will address all relevant pre-meeting issues and determine
the: (1) Round Table issues; (2) process for developing issue papers prior to the Round Table; (3) timeframes; (4)
meeting schedule; (5) Round Table discussion rules; and (6) any other matter which would assist in an effective and
full discussion.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc
Spey series turbofan engines. This proposal would require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure
turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) steel disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. This proposal is prompted
by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor steel disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT steel turbine disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion,
which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey
series turbofan engines. The CAA advises that they have received a report of a three-inch crack extending radially
outward from the bore of a steel stage 7 high pressure compressor disk installed in an R&hyph;R Spey 506&hyph;14D engine.
The crack had originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's entry into service. Subsequent
investigation revealed that engine failure due to disk burst was imminent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA has determined that steel stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks
could also contain corrosion pitting that could have been present since original manufacture. Rolls-Royce, plc
has informed the FAA that all turbine disks installed in Spey engine models type certificated in the United States
are made of steel. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an HPT or LPT steel turbine disk burst due to cracking
attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing and further analysis indicate that to ensure that steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks do not operate under
prolonged exposure to levels of corrosion greater than the overhaul manual limits, at least one inspection is required
after 40% of the disk cyclic life is expended in order for the disk to continue in service and to reliably attain full
disk cyclic life. Rolls-Royce, plc has issued Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1044, dated September 1992, that specifies
a one-time inspection of steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. The CAA classified
this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the airworthiness of these R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan engines
in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan
engines of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time inspection
of steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed at least
40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These disks
must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit for either
HPT or LPT overhaul after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will allow stage 1 and stage
2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD and
that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it would take no additional work hours per engine
to accomplish the proposed actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during scheduled overhauls. Approximately
80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform
the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $189,750. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc
(R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. This document proposes to supersede Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52,
which superseded Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51. Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 reduced cyclic life
limits for seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000
TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 currently
requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. This proposal
would increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models, eliminate the option for
repetitive inspections, and further reduce the cyclic life limits. This proposal is prompted by further investigation
into disk bore cracking that was caused by corrosion. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority of the United Kingdom, notified the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan
engines. The CAA advises that they have received a report of a three-inch crack extending radially outward from the
bore on a seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk installed in a R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14D engine.
The crack originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's entry into service. Investigation
indicated that failure of the engine due to disk burst was imminent. That condition, if not corrected, could result
in a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine
failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that airworthiness directive (AD) action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 20, 1988, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, which reduced cyclic life limits for seventh
stage HPC disks from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14
and &hyph;14D engines. On January 26, 1989, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which supersedes
Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, and currently requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic
life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of these two previous AD's, further investigation of the cracked disk revealed that the crack originated
from a corrosion pit that could have been present at the disk's entry into service. A testing program investigated
the effects of corrosion on seventh stage HPC disks, and as a result of this investigation, disk cyclic life has been
reevaluated, assuming the possible presence of corrosion at entry into service. To account for the possible presence
of corrosion, this proposed AD would further reduce the cyclic life limit, and would require removing from service
seventh stage HPC disks that exceed the revised cyclic life limits following the schedule established in this AD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised limit reduces the cyclic life limit below the point that intermediate, repetitive inspections are practical;
therefore, this AD does not provide for repetitive inspections. In addition, this AD would increase the effectivity
to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models not affected by the previous Telegraphic AD's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rolls-Royce issued Mandatory Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1034, Revision 1, dated May 4, 1990, that describes
the revised cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks, and the additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models affected.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the airworthiness of these R&hyph;R Spey
series turbofan engines in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan
engines of this same type design installed on aircraft registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede
Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 to increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine
models, eliminate the option for repetitive inspections of seventh stage HPC disks, further reduce the cyclic life
limits, and require removing from service disks that exceed the revised cyclic life limits following the schedule
established in this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described
previously.

The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, and
that it would not take any additional work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions. Replacement parts,
prorated for the reduced life, would cost approximately $1,718 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,214.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric
Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require installation of a fan stator
case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one fan shroud. This proposal is prompted by a report of an uncontained
stage one fan blade failure, which resulted in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in
an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received a report of an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, attributed
to excessive fan blade tip clearance. Engines without a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one
fan shroud, operate with relatively open stage one fan blade tip clearances. Increased fan rotor vibration occurs
when the average tip clearance exceeds the maximum allowable clearance tolerances. This increased vibration increases
stresses in the fan blade shank, which leads to cracking and subsequent blade failure. This condition, if not corrected,
could result in an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage
to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;573,
Revision 5, dated September 15, 1981, that describes procedures for the installation of the stiffening ring assembly
and new stage one fan shroud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist, or develop, on other engines of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly and a new stage one
fan shroud, which will result in reduced running clearances, and lower fan blade stresses. The compliance end date
of August 31, 1995, ensures timely compliance without forced engine removals based on hardware availability. The
actions would be required to be accomplished, in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 67 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA has been advised by the manufacturer that there are no engines on U.S. registered aircraft that would
be affected by this AD. However, should an affected engine be imported on an aircraft and placed on the U.S. registry
in the future, it would take approximately 48 work hours to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $9,360 per engine. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD is estimated to be $12,000 per engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric
Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require repetitive inspections
of the left compressor discharge pressure (CDP) manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks, and if found cracked, rework
or replacement with serviceable parts. This proposal would also require rework or replacement of the left CDP manifold,
lower CDP tube, stage 14 turnbuckle, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection of the compressor rear
frame (CRF) as a terminating action to the inspection program. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracks in the
left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and CRF bleed port struts, that have resulted in inflight engine shutdowns and rejected
takeoffs. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent cracks in the left CDP manifold, lower CDP
tube, and CRF bleed port struts, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown, rejected takeoff, or damage to
the engine nacelle.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed airworthiness directive (AD) is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50
series turbofan engines. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received 228 reports of cracks in the left
compressor discharge pressure (CDP) manifold, lower CDP tube, and compressor rear frame (CRF) bleed port struts.
Of these 228 reports, 24 have resulted in inflight engine shutdowns, and 24 in rejected takeoffs. The current type
design hardware has been found to crack, allowing hot air to leak into the core cowl area, resulting in false fire warnings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cracks in the current type design hardware are the result of high cycle fatigue (HCF). The excessive stress is the
result of both thermal and airframe installation loading factors. New hardware exists which decreases operating
stresses, therefore reducing the chance of cracks due to HCF. This condition, if not corrected, may result in cracks
in the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and CRF bleed port struts, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown,
rejected takeoff, or damage to the engine nacelle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 75&hyph;065,
Revision 1, dated March 26, 1993, that describes procedures for rework or replacement of the left CDP manifold, lower
CDP tube, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection of the CRF bleed port struts; GE CF6&hyph;50 SB No.
75&hyph;067, dated March 15, 1993, that describes procedures for rework or replacement of the stage 14 turnbuckle;
and GE CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 75&hyph;064, Revision 2, dated July 23, 1992, that describes procedures for repetitive
inspections of the left CDP manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the left CDP manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks,
and if found cracked, rework or replacement with serviceable parts. This proposal would also require rework or replacement
of the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, stage 14 turnbuckle, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection
of the CRF as a terminating action to the inspection program. The compliance end-date of October 31, 1996, is proposed
to ensure timely compliance. Based upon engine shop visit rates, a compliance end-date of October 31, 1996, will ensure
timely compliance while minimizing the number of forced engine removals. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 2202 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet.
The FAA estimates that 223 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed inspections, 32 work hours per engine
to accomplish the proposed terminating action, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts
would cost approximately $27,500 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $6,549,510. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is requesting public comment on the text of a draft
two page generic risk disclosure statement currently being discussed among various international futures regulators
that potentially could be used to meet the risk disclosure requirements for both domestic and foreign commodity futures
and commodity option products subject to regulation by the CFTC. As contemplated by Commission rule 1.55(c), the
text of the generic risk disclosure statement is being published, in part, to further these discussions relative
to the development of one document to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of the CFTC and such foreign jurisdictions
as may choose to adopt its language for use in their jurisdictions. Based on the comments received, the CFTC may be better
able to provide input to these discussions and to consider rule amendments to permit the substitution of this statement
under rule 1.55(c) and certain other rules for firms doing cross-border business.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 30, 1993, the Commission, among other things, adopted final rule amendments to Commission rule 1.55(b) which
simplified the risk disclosure process by consolidating the risk disclosure statements applicable to domestic
futures transactions and foreign futures and foreign commodity options transactions in rules 1.55 and 30.6, respectively.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The use of such a statement was intended to greatly simplify the risk disclosure process for U.S. firms conducting
cross-border business.

58 FR 17496 (April 5, 1993). These amendments also: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_eliminated the requirement that the rule 190.10 disclosure regarding treatment of non-cash margin be acknowledged
by the customer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_clarified that the rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement may be included in a booklet of account opening documents,
provided it appears on the cover page or following the cover page of such booklet; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_provided that the Commission may approve a risk disclosure statement that has been approved by a foreign jurisdiction
or foreign SRO for use in lieu of the Commission-required statement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_permitted the use of a single acknowledgement for rule 1.55 and 33.7 statements and other elections, subject to specified
conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_simplified the disclosure requirements regarding the bulk transfer of accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to Commission suggestions in the notice of proposed rulemaking concerning rule 1.55 that it also was considering
the development of a ``plain language'' options disclosure statement,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 some commenters supported that course of action and further suggested that the Commission not only shorten the rule
33.7 disclosure statement applicable to exchange-traded commodity option transactions but also consolidate it
with the new combined domestic futures and foreign futures and foreign commodity options statement. In response,
the Commission noted that certain international regulators were endeavoring to develop a single risk disclosure
statement that could be used in multiple jurisdictions to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements applicable to
domestic and cross-border transactions in futures and options. The Commission stated that if a universal statement
were to be developed, it would consider permitting the use of such a statement in lieu of the new consolidated rule 1.55
risk disclosure statement as well as the options risk disclosure statement required by current rule 33.7.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Under amended rule 1.55(c), the Commission may permit the substituted use of a risk disclosure statement approved
by a foreign regulatory or self-regulatory organization if the Commission determines that such statement reasonably
is calculated to provide the disclosure required by Commission rule 1.55(b).

For some time, a working group
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 of international regulators worked towards developing a single risk disclosure statement which could satisfy the
risk disclosure requirements applicable, in the multiple participating jurisdictions, to domestic and cross-border
transactions in futures and options (``generic disclosure statement'').
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Following extensive discussions, the draft generic disclosure statement set forth herein was developed and the
draft text was passed to those regulatory authorities (including the CFTC) who were interested in taking the work
forward. The text remains subject to final discussion and approval by the regulatory authorities of the participating
jurisdictions.

It is intended that the generic disclosure statement would specify, in an addendum on a third page, the participating
jurisdictions and the specific products for which it could be used. The addendum would be updated periodically as
new jurisdictions adopted the text. In the United States, it is contemplated that such risk disclosure statement,
if ultimately proposed and adopted after further public comment, would satisfy only those risk disclosure obligations
set forth in Commission rules 1.55 (which incorporates the risk-disclosure contained in Commission rule 30.6),
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 the special disclosures related to futures-style margining of options permitted on certain foreign exchanges,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and the special bankruptcy disclosures of Commission rule 190.10(c) related to the acceptance of non-cash margin.

The Commission notes in this regard that pending resolution of the Commission's determination on this draft generic
risk disclosure statement, firms operating pursuant to Commission rule 30.10 relief should continue to comply with
the risk disclosure requirements set forth in the relevant Commission orders and that for these purposes may continue
to use the text of rule 30.6 as published prior to the 1993 revisions to Commission rules 1.55 and 30.6 (which incorporated
the rule 30.6 disclosures for foreign futures into the rule 1.55 disclosures for domestic futures) (see 58 FR 17496
(April 5, 1993)).

Approach Taken By Working Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approach taken by the international working group with respect to risk disclosure has been to develop a draft generic
statement which focuses on the major risks of trading and contains the basic generic disclosures required by most
jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the approach of the working group was to eliminate much of the definitional and educational material which currently
is required to be disclosed by Commission rule 33.7 and to treat options disclosure in a manner equivalent to disclosure
for futures. As such, the statement is intended to focus customer attention on the risks of trading, as currently is
the practice with futures risk disclosure. Further, the statement would highlight the importance of obtaining sufficient
information as to the specifics of trading without attempting to address the differences from market to market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of a Commission mandated description of options trading and other educational material from the
mandated risk disclosure statement does not mean, however, that firms do not have the obligation to provide all material
disclosures in compliance with Commission and National Futures Association (NFA) rules.

Additional Topics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the working group's objective was not only to create a risk disclosure statement that categorized existing disclosure
requirements in most jurisdictions but also to incorporate new matters deemed relevant in an evolving marketplace,
the generic statement also contains the following additional topics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Supporting Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current draft generic disclosure statement would briefly disclose the fact that most open-outcry and electronic
trading facilities are supported by computer-based component systems, which are vulnerable to temporary disruption
or failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Electronic Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Differences in electronic trading systems are such that a common disclosure appropriate to the specifics of each
such system may not be feasible and, in the case of domestic contract market electronic systems, the draft generic
disclosure statement would not substitute for disclosure requirements that currently are required by individual
contract markets for such systems. However, as the purpose of the draft generic disclosure statement is to articulate
general risks common to futures and options trading, it is possible in the case of electronic systems to identify the
risks common to any such system, such as the possibility of system failure and that the liability of the system provider
may be limited. No attempt has been made to describe in detail the specifics of any one system. On the contrary, the proposed
disclosure text encourages the customer to ask the firm with which it is dealing for details in this respect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Off-Exchange Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft generic disclosure statement also contains a reference to the risks of off-exchange trading. The international
working group drafting the consolidated disclosure statement concluded that such a provision, if worded appropriately,
would not mislead or confuse customers in those jurisdictions which, for example, do not permit retail customers
to participate in off-exchange markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Request For Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is inviting public comment and suggestions generally on the draft text of the generic risk disclosure
statement so that any material public concerns can be considered by the Commission. The Commission also requests
public comment on whether the use of a generic disclosure statement to substitute for current disclosures contained
in rules 1.55, 33.7, 190.10 and Commission orders and Advisories regarding disclosures related to futures-style
margining of option premiums allowed by certain foreign exchanges would be most useful if made mandatory for certain
categories of registrants, and if so, which categories should be included, and whether use should be limited to firms
doing cross-border business or more broadly available.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks and other significant aspects of trading in futures and options.
In light of the risks, you should undertake such transactions only if you understand the nature of the contracts (and
contractual relationships) into which you are entering and the extent of your exposure to risk. Trading in futures
and options is not suitable for many members of the public. You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate
for you in light of your experience, objectives, financial resources and other relevant circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Futures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Effect of ``Leverage'' or ``Gearing'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transactions in futures carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the
futures contract so that transactions are ``leveraged'' or ``geared.'' A relatively small market movement will
have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against
you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the
firm to maintain your position. If the market moves against your position or margin levels are increased, you may be
called upon to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with
a request for additional funds within the time prescribed, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be
liable for any resulting deficit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Risk-reducing Orders or Strategies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The placing of certain orders (e.g. ``stop-loss'' orders, where permitted under local law, or ``stop-limit'' orders)
which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts may not be effective because market conditions may make it impossible
to execute such orders. Strategies using combinations of positions, such as ``spread'' and ``straddle'' positions
may be as risky as taking simple ``long'' or ``short'' positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Variable Degree of Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transactions in options carry a high degree of risk. Purchasers and sellers of options should familiarize themselves
with the type of option (i.e. put or call) which they contemplate trading and the associated risks. You should calculate
the extent to which the value of the options must increase for your position to become profitable, taking into account
the premium and all transaction costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purchaser of options may offset or exercise the options or allow the options to expire. The exercise of an option
results either in a cash settlement or in the purchaser acquiring or delivering the underlying interest. If the option
is on a future, the purchaser will acquire a futures position with associated liabilities for margin (see the section
on Futures above). If the purchased options expire worthless, you will suffer a total loss of your investment which
will consist of the option premium plus transaction costs. If you are contemplating purchasing deep-out-of-the-money
options, you should be aware that the chance of such options becoming profitable ordinarily is remote. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selling (``writing'' or ``granting'') an option generally entails considerably greater risk than purchasing options.
Although the premium received by the seller is fixed, the seller may sustain a loss well in excess of that amount. The
seller will be liable for additional margin to maintain the position if the market moves unfavorably. The seller will
also be exposed to the risk of the purchaser exercising the option and the seller will be obligated to either settle
the option in cash or to acquire or deliver the underlying interest. If the option is on a future, the seller will acquire
a position in a future with associated liabilities for margin (see the section on Futures above). If the option is ``covered''
by the seller holding a corresponding position in the underlying interest or a future or another option, the risk may
be reduced. If the option is not covered, the risk of loss can be unlimited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain exchanges in some jurisdictions permit deferred payment of the option premium, exposing the purchaser to
liability for margin payments not exceeding the amount of the premium. The purchaser is still subject to the risk of
losing the premium and transaction costs. When the option is exercised or expires, the purchaser is responsible for
any unpaid premium outstanding at that time.

Additional Risks Common to Futures and Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Terms and Conditions of Contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
You should ask the firm with which you deal about the terms and conditions of the specific futures or options which you
are trading and associated obligations (e.g. the circumstances under which you may become obligated to make or take
delivery of the underlying interest of a futures contract and, in respect of options, expiration dates and restrictions
on the time for exercise). Under certain circumstances the specifications of outstanding contracts (including
the exercise price of an option) may be modified by the exchange or clearing house to reflect changes in the underlying
interest.

5. Suspension or Restriction of Trading and Pricing Relationships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Market conditions (e.g. illiquidity) and/or the operation of the rules of certain markets (e.g. the suspension of
trading in any contract or contract month because of price limits or ``circuit breakers'') may increase the risk of
loss by making it difficult or impossible to effect transactions or liquidate/offset positions. If you have sold
options, this may increase the risk of loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, normal pricing relationships between the underlying interest and the future, and the underlying interest
and the option may not exist. This can occur when, for example, the futures contract underlying the option is subject
to price limits while the option is not. The absence of an underlying reference price may make it difficult to judge
``fair'' value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Deposited Cash and Property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded money or other property you deposit for domestic and
foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover
your money or property may be governed by specific legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, property which

in the event of a shortfall.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Commission and Other Charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before you begin to trade, you should obtain a clear explanation of all commission, fees and other charges for which
you will be liable. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Transactions in Other Jurisdictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, may expose
you to additional risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation which may offer different or diminished investor
protection. Before you trade you should enquire about any rules relevant to your particular transactions. Your local
regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in
other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected. You should ask the firm with which you deal for details
about the types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other relevant jurisdictions before you start
to trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Currency Risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The profit or loss in transactions in foreign currency-denominated contracts (whether they are traded in your own
or another jurisdiction) will be affected by fluctuations in currency rates where there is a need to convert from the
currency denomination of the contract to another currency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Trading Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most open-outcry and electronic trading facilities are supported by computer-based component systems for the order-routing,
execution, matching, registration or clearing of trades. As with all facilities and systems, they are vulnerable
to temporary disruption or failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Electronic Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trading on an electronic trading system may differ not only from trading in an open-outcry market but also from trading
on other electronic trading systems. If you undertake transactions on an electronic trading system, you will be exposed
to risks associated with the system including the failure of hardware and software. The result of any system failure
may be that your order is either not executed according to your instructions or is not executed at all. Your ability
to recover certain losses which are particularly attributable to trading on a market using an electronic trading
system may be limited to less than the amount of your total loss. Limits on liability may be imposed by the system provider,
the market, the clearing house and/or member firms. Such limits may vary: You should ask the firm with which you deal
for details in this respect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Off-exchange Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some jurisdictions, and only then in restricted circumstances, firms are permitted to effect off-exchange transactions.
The firm with which you deal may be acting as your counterparty to the transaction. It may be difficult or impossible
to liquidate an existing position, to assess the value, to determine a fair price or to assess the exposure to risk.
For these reasons, these transactions may involve increased risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-exchange transactions may be less regulated or subject to a separate regulatory regime. Before you undertake
such transactions, you should familiarize yourself with applicable rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 5, 1993, the Commission authorized publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of a proposal to make major amendments to the Commission's Rules of Practice. Published on November 22, 1993 (58 FR
61732), this proposal stems from the work of the Commission's Task Force on Administrative Proceedings, chaired
by Commissioner Mary Schapiro. In addition to updating the Commission's existing rules and make them more consistent
with actual practices, the proposed revisions would establish procedures to implement the authority granted to
the Commission by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act. The Commission requested that
comments the received by January 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the Rules, the Commission has received from interested persons a number of requests for an
extension of the comment period. On December 27, 1993, an Ad Hoc Committee of the American Bar Association that is preparing
comments in response to the Commission's proposal sent a letter requesting that the comment period be extended from
January 6, 1994 to February 1, 1994. The stated reason for this request is the ABA requires more time because of the breadth
of the Commission's proposal and its accompanying commentary. Three other parties have contacted the Commission's
Office of the General Counsel to request an extension of the comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the length and complexity of the release and the benefits to the Commission of receiving carefully considered
comments, the Commission believes a reasonable extension of the comment period is appropriate. Therefore, in order
to assist interested participants in their consideration and preparation of carefully reasoned comments, the Commission
is extending the comment period for all persons to February 4, 1994.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period for responding to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34&hyph;33163 is extended to February 4,
1994.

 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considering the establishment of a viticultural area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in Siskiyou County, California, to be known as

``Seiad Valley.'' This proposal is the result of a petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed by Brian J. Helsaple of Seiad Valley Vineyards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that the establishment of viticultural areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows wineries to designate the specific areas where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grapes used to make the wine were grown and enables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers to better identify the wines they purchase.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definite American viticultural areas. The regulations also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for the listing of approved American viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), title 27, CFR, defines an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region distinguishable by geographical features, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a viticultural area. The petition should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring to the area specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Evidence relating to the geographical features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from surrounding areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area, based on features which can be found on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest applicable scale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the

ATF has received a petition from Brian J. Helsaple of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seiad Valley Vineyards proposing to establish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area in Siskiyou County, California, to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as ``Seiad Valley.'' The proposed viticultural area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in northwestern California, about 15 miles south of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Oregon border. It contains approximately 2160 acres, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which approximately 2.5 acres are planted to vineyards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seiad Valley Vineyards is the only commercial grower and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the only wine producer currently active within the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The U.S.G.S. map used to show the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed area (the Seiad Valley Quadrangle 7.5 minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series map) uses the name ``Seiad Valley'' to describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area immediately surrounding Seiad Creek, corresponding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the portion of the proposed area which is north of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Klamath River. The map also shows the town of Seiad Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within this area. The map shows no separate designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the portion of the proposed area south of the Klamath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River, which is drained by Grider Creek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The petitioner provided excerpts from the 1957 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of Siskiyou Pioneer, an annual publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Siskiyou County Historical Society, which discuss the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history of the name Seiad Valley, and local understanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the extent of the area known as Seiad, or Seiad Valley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Sciad,'' by Betty Livingston and Hazel Davis, states the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name Seiad was originally spelled Sciad, and the creek and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valley were called that by the trappers ``before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospectors came in 1850.'' Sometime after 1871, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spelling of the name changed to Seiad. In ``Gold Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Scott Bar to Happy Camp,'' by J.B. Grider, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following description appears: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Seiad is a small valley two miles long and one mile wide *&blank;*&blank;* There are two large creeks in Seiad, Grider
Creek and Seiad Creek. Grider Creek flows north into the Klamath from the Marble Mountain territory. Seiad creek flows
south into the Klamath from the Siskiyous and Red Mountain.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The petitioner also provided a copy of a claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document dated August 26, 1942, which states the Grider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek mining claim is ``situate in the Seiad Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Evidence of Boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner has defined the proposed area primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by its elevation, using the 1600 and 1800 foot contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lines. As evidence that the proposed boundaries for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area are as specified in the petition, the petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that the vegetation within and outside the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a dramatic contrast. Within the proposed area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cottonwood, oak and willow trees and wild blackberries and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grapes grow in addition to the cultivated crops. Outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed area, on the higher slopes of the surrounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mountains, conifers such as cedar, Douglas fir and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ponderossa pine predominate in the thin, eroded soils with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scant summer moisture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Geographical Features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed viticultural area consists of the valleys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drained by Seiad Creek and Grider Creek, which both flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the Klamath River in northwestern California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petitioner, these valleys and an expanse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of land along the Klamath River which connects them share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of topography, soil composition and climate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which distinguish the proposed viticultural area from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding areas. The petitioner provided the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence to support his claims: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Topography 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S.G.S. topographic map submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner shows the proposed area is a relatively flat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area varying in elevation from 1,400 to 1,600 feet, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small portion as high as 1,800 feet, surrounded by steeply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rising terrain. Outside the area, the elevation ranges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 2,000 to 2,800 feet, with peaks exceeding 3,000 feet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on all sides, and some peaks as high as 3,900 feet. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner explains that snow melt, runoff, and erosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from these higher areas into the valley create a contrast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in both the quality of soils and the availability of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within and outside the proposed area. The lower elevation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the proposed area also contributes to more moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Soil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the valley floor ``is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composed of deep fertile soil mixtures of loam, sand, clay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and rocks eroded from the surrounding mountain slopes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to a draft environmental impact report prepared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1975 by the California Department of Transportation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valley floor is ``mostly alluvium deposits which were widely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dredged and hydraulically mined for gold. Chromite was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also mined within the Seiad Valley area.'' Dredging left 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tailings,'' or piles of rounded rocks, wherever the dredge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated. The petitioner states that these granite-dominated rock tailings store heat during the day and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide protection against frost in spring and fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Climate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner provided the following material related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the climate in the area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) An article in the Pioneer Press of September 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, titled ``Rock-pile grapevines surprising all experts,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrasted Siskiyou County growing conditions with those in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seiad Valley vineyard: ``What's stopped the area from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becoming a wine-producing area are the erratic late spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
freezes in the zone where elevations are low enough to even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it possible. And in some of the county's lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevation areas, the precipitation levels are too high.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The article stated the rock tailings in his vineyard ``may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give Helsaple just the edge he needs to be the county's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first successful longterm wine grape grower.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Sunset New Western Garden Book, 1979 edition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
climate map of northern California and western Nevada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed Seiad Valley as Zone 7, and characterizes a Zone 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
climate as having hot summers and mild but pronounced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winters, favorable for deciduous fruit that requires a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marked seasonal pattern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Boundary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The boundary of the proposed Seiad Valley viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area may be found on one United States Geological Survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(U.S.G.S.) map with a scale of 1:24000. The boundary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in &sect;9.148. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this proposed regulation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866. Accordingly, this proposal is not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis required by this Executive Order.

carefully considered. Comments received after that date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be given the same consideration if it is practical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as to comments received on or before the closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF will not recognize any comment as confidential.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Boundary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Seiad Valley viticultural area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in Siskiyou County, California. The boundary is as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The beginning point is the intersection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1600 foot contour line with the power transmission line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north of the Klamath River, near Mile 130; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1600' contour line in a generally northeasterly direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until it reaches the intersection of an unnamed light duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
road and an unimproved road just west of Canyon Creek; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The boundary then follows the unimproved road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north to its end, then goes east in a straight line until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it reaches the 1800' contour line; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The boundary then follows the 1800' contour line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a northeasterly direction to the point, near Sawmill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulch, where the contour line crosses Seiad Creek and turns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south and west; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The boundary continues to follow the 1800' contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line as it proceeds southwest for approximately 4.5 miles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then turns sharply south-southeast for approximately 0.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miles, until the contour line turns sharply east at a point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just north of the Klamath River; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The boundary then diverges from the 1800' contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line and proceeds south-southeast in a straight line, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across the Klamath River and State route 96, until it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intersects with the 1600' contour line; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The boundary then follows the 1600' contour line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south and west, then north and west, roughly following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of the Klamath River, until it reaches an unnamed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peak 1744 feet high; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(8) The boundary continues along the 1600' contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line as it diverges from the Klamath River and proceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south, just to the east of an unnamed light duty road, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the point where that road crosses Grider Creek; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the west side of Grider Creek;

A. Background for This Action Regarding Section 211(m) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Motor vehicles are significant contributors of carbon monoxide emissions. An important measure toward reducing
these emissions is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen enhances fuel combustion and helps
to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starts, which are more prevalent in the winter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(m) of the Act requires that various states submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline
programs no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with carbon monoxide nonattainment
areas with design values of 9.5 parts per million or more based generally on 1988 and 1989 data. Each state's oxygenated
gasoline program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen
by weight during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide.
Under section 211(m)(2), the oxygenated gasoline requirements are to generally cover all gasoline sold or dispensed
in the larger of the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
in which the nonattainment area is located. Under section 211(m)(2), the length of the control period, to be established
by the EPA Administrator, shall not be less than four months unless a state can demonstrate that, because of meteorological
conditions, a reduced control period will assure that there will be no carbon monoxide exceedances outside of such
reduced period. EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods by area in the

 Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content
than is required (i.e., an oxygen content greater than 2.7 percent by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset
the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. Where a credit program has been adopted, EPA's guidelines
provide that no gallon of gasoline should contain less than 2.0% oxygen by weight.

1. Type of Program and Oxygen Content Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, section 211(m)(2) of the Act requires that gasoline sold or dispensed for use in the specified
control areas contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Under section 211(m)(5), the EPA Administrator
issued guidelines for credit programs allowing the use of marketable oxygen credits. The State of Colorado, by the
authority of the Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC), has elected to adopt a regulation requiring 2.7% oxygen content
for each gallon of gasoline sold in a control area, not allowing for the use of marketable oxygen credits. The following
sections of this notice address some specific elements of the State's submittal. Parties desiring more specific
information should consult the TSD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicability and Program Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(m)(2) requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold during a control period based on air quality monitoring
data and established by the EPA Administrator. Colorado has established control periods consistent with the EPA
guidance. The control period for all of Colorado's affected areas begins on the first day of November each year and
ends following the last day of February. Colorado State oxygenated gasoline regulations require oxygenated gasoline
to be sold in the Fort Collins-Loveland MSA, the Colorado Springs MSA, and the Boulder-Denver MSA, consistent with
the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Transfer Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado has no requirements related to transfer documentation in its oxygenated gasoline regulation. EPA feels
that the State's policy of presumptive liability provides the incentive for all parties to ensure gasoline meets
the oxygen content requirements of the program. In lieu of transfer documentation indicating oxygen content, the
State provides for presumptive liability on the part of the party in possession of gasoline found to be in violation
of the required oxygen content, and allows for no defenses. The State has historically inspected refineries, bulk
fuel storage plants, fuel distribution plants, pipelines, and retail station for fuel compliance, holding all parties
responsible to meet oxygen content requirements for gasoline in their possession. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Enforcement and Penalty Schedules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State oxygenated gasoline regulations must be enforceable by the state oversight agency. EPA recommends that states
visit at least 20% of regulated parties during a given control period. Inspections should consist of product sampling
and record review. In addition, each state should devise a comprehensive penalty schedule. Penalties should reflect
the severity of a party's violation, the compliance history of the party, as well as the potential environmental harm
associated with the violation.

The Colorado oxygenated gasoline regulation is legally enforceable by the Colorado Department of Health, Division
of Air Pollution Control (APCD). The APCD is committed to the enforcement of this program requiring a level of sampling
greater than EPA's recommendation for the sampling of 20% of all oxygenated gasoline dispensing sites. Violation
of this regulation results in a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day of violation. The APCD considers three factors
when assessing penalties: the penalty constraint; the economic benefit of noncompliance; and a gravity component
taking into consideration the intentional nature of the violation, whether the violator cooperated with the APCD,
whether a repeat violation has occurred, the actual oxygen content of the sample, and an other relevant factors as
detailed in the Oxygenated Gasoline Program Policy and Procedure Manual (Procedure Manual), published by the Colorado
Department of Health, Air Pollution Control Division, October 1992. Penalty authority is contained in section 25&hyph;7&hyph;122

5. Test Methods and Laboratory Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each state regulation must include a test method. EPA's guidelines recommend the use of the OFID test, although parties
may elect to use ASTM-D4815&hyph;89 or another method, approved by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has tentatively approved a variation of the ASTM-D4815&hyph;89 testing method for use in Colorado, as detailed
in the Procedure Manual. The State may continue to use this testing method unless otherwise instructed by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has established an interim testing tolerance, which states appropriate ranges for credit and per-gallon programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As EPA states in the memorandum, for a per-gallon program, such as adopted by Colorado, the purpose of the testing is
to determine whether the gasoline contains less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Colorado is using testing tolerances
consistent with the tolerances in the EPA memo.

B. Background for This Action Regarding Regulation No. 13 Prior to the Requirements of Section 211(m) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 6, 1990, the Governor of Colorado submitted additional revisions to Regulation No. 13. The Regulation 13
amendments were necessary because the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) found that progress toward
attaining the carbon monoxide (CO) standard was not adequate to meet the December 31, 1987, Clean Air Act deadline.
The August 6, 1990, revisions required between December 1 and March 1 of each winter season, a 2.6 percent level of oxygen
for all gasoline except premium unleaded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that this, August 6, 1990, revision to Regulations No. 13 does not meet EPA's current guidance for oxygenated
gasoline programs. However, Colorado's present SIP revision, November 27, 1993, for the oxygenated gasoline program
amends the State's existing program, which includes elements that were contained in the past SIP revision, August
6, 1990. EPA is also proposing to approve this past revision, in order for the SIP to be considered fully approved.

Request for Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will
be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the address above. Comments must be received on or before February 10, 1994.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to approve the revisions to the Colorado SIP for both Regulation No. 13 (oxygenated gasoline program)
revisions, meeting the requirements of section 211(m) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Executive Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Regulatory Flexibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 11, 1992, the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) redelegated certain authorities to all State Directors
dealing with the settlement of and/or the release of liability on FmHA debts owed by borrowers who made application
to settle their FmHA debts or request release of liability. Notice of this redelegation was published in 57 FR 43688
(September 22, 1992). The redelegation authority, granted on September 11, 1992, expired on September 30, 1993,
and the Administrator now gives notice to extend that redelegation until December 31, 1994. All release of liability
cases of $1,000,000 or more (including principal, interest and other charges) must be submitted to the National Office
for approval by the Administrator. This action is taken to expedite the processing of requests of borrowers who are
unable to repay all of their FmHA debts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effect of the extension of the redelegation of the Administrator's authority is to continue to expedite the administrative
review process for releases of liability, permitting more timely debt relief to FmHA borrowers, and to consequently
reduce the Agency's portfolio of inactive uncollectible accounts.

The purpose of this notice is to announce the availability, after January 14, 1994, of the draft report of the Federal
Internetworking Requirements Panel (FIRP). This panel was named by NIST to review open systems network requirements
and to recommend policies on the use of networking standards by the Federal government. Organized in cooperation
with the Federal Networking Council and the Federal Information Resources Management Policy Council, the FIRP has
been considering issues related to interoperability requirements, security, ease of use, national and international
connectivity, and standards maintenance for the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS), Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
specifications, and proprietary networking protocols.

The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce has approved a revision of Federal Information
Processing Standard 140, General Security Requirements for Equipment Using the Data Encryption Standard, which
will be published as FIPS Publication 140&hyph;1. This revised standard supersedes FIPS 140 in its entirety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 8, 1991, a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 681) that a revision of Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 140, General Security
Requirement for Equipment Using the Data Encryption Standard, was being proposed for Federal use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The written comments submitted by interested parties and other material available to the Department relevant to
this proposed revision were reviewed by NIST. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approve
the revised standard as Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 140&hyph;1, and prepared
a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available
for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert
C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical
requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.

Explanation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This standard specifies the security requirements that are to be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within
a security system protecting unclassified information within computer and telecommunication systems (including
voice systems). The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3,
and Level 4. These levels are intended to cover the wide range of potential applications and environments in which
cryptographic modules may be employed. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design and implementation
of a cryptographic module. These areas include basic design and documentation, module interfaces, authorized roles
and services, physical security, software security, operating system security, key management, cryptographic
algorithms, electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC), and self-testing. This
standard supersedes FIPS 140, General Security Requirements for Equipment Using the Data Encryption Standard,
in its entirety.

7. Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This standard is applicable to all Federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems to protect unclassified
information within computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) that are not subject to Section
2315 of Title 10, U.S. Code, or Section 3502(2) of Title 44, U.S. Code. This standard shall be used in designing, acquiring
and implementing cryptographic-based security systems within computer and telecommunication systems (including
voice systems), operated by a Federal agency or by a contractor of a Federal agency or other organization that processes
information (using a computer or telecommunications system) on behalf of the Federal Government to accomplish a
Federal function. Federal agencies which use cryptographic-based security systems for protecting classified
information may use those systems for protecting unclassified information in lieu of systems that comply with this
standard. Non-Federal government organizations are encouraged to adopt and use this standard when it provides the
desired security for protecting valuable or sensitive information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Cryptographic-based security systems may be utilized in various computer and telecommunication (including voice)
applications (e.g., data storage, access control and personal identification, radio, facsimile, video) and in
various environments (e.g., centralized computer facilities, office environments, hostile environments). The
cryptographic services (e.g., encryption, authentication, digital signature, key management) provided by a cryptographic
module will be based on many factors which are specific to the application and environment. The security level of a
cryptographic module shall be chosen to provide a level of security appropriate for the security requirements of
the application and environment in which the module is to be utilized and the security services which the module is
to provide. The security requirements for a particular security level include both the security requirements specific
to that level and the security requirements that apply to all modules regardless of the level. System characteristics
not related to security (e.g., telecommunications interoperability) are beyond the scope of this standard.

For a one year period following the six months after the establishment of the FIPS 140&hyph;1 validation program,
agencies shall purchase either equipment with validated FIPS 140&hyph;1 cryptographic modules, or equipment whose
cryptographic modules have been submitted for FIPS 140&hyph;1 validation. After this period, only FIPS 140&hyph;1
validated cryptographic modules will be considered as meeting the provisions of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 2 summarizes the schedule for acquisition of FIPS 140 compliant equipment. For up to three years following June
30, 1994, equipment with cryptographic modules complying to FIPS 140, General Security Requirements for Equipment
Using the Data Encryption Standard (formerly Federal Standard 1027), may be purchased in lieu of equipment with modules
that comply with this standard. These modules either shall have been endorsed by the National Security Agency (NSA)
as complying to Federal Standard 1027, or shall be affirmed in writing by the manufacturer as complying to FIPS 140.
NSA endorsed modules shall have been endorsed prior to December, 1993. A list of endorsed products (NSA Endorsed Data
Encryption Standard (DES) Products List) is available from the NSA. For modules affirmed by the manufacturer as complying
with FIPS 140, a copy of the written affirmation shall have been sent by the manufacturer to the Director of the Computer
Systems Laboratory at NIST prior to June 30, 1994. A list of these methods is available from NIST. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment purchased under the above conditions may continue to be used for the lifetime of the equipment without the
need for further affirmation or validation for conformance to this standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The security requirements specified in this standard are based upon information provided by many sources within
the Federal government and private industry. The requirements are designed to protect against adversaries mounting
cost-effective attacks on unclassified government or commercial data (e.g., hackers, organized crime, economic
competitors). The primary goal in designing an effective security system is to make the cost of any attack greater
than the possible payoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the security requirements specified in this standard are intended to maintain the security of a cryptographic
module, conformance to this standard does not guarantee that a particular module is secure. It is the responsibility
of the manufacturer of a cryptographic module to build the module in a secure manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the use of a cryptographic module that conforms to this standard in an overall system does not guarantee
the security of the overall system. The responsible authority in each agency shall assure that an overall system provides
an acceptable level of security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a standard of this nature must be flexible enough to adapt to advancements and innovations in science and technology,
this standard will be reviewed every 5 years in order to consider new or revised requirements that may be needed to meet
technological and economic changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver Procedure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal agencies may approve waivers to Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official designated
pursuant to Section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Government Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under Section 552(b) of Title 5, U.S.
Code, shall be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.

<DOCTITLE>Trilateral Cross-Margining Program Among the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Intermarket Clearing Corporation, and the Options Clearing Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') have submitted to
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (``Act''), 7 U.S.C. &sect;7a(a)(12)(A), and Commission Regulation 1.41(b), 17 CFR 1.41(b), a proposal
to implement a trilateral cross-margining program with the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') (CME, ICC, and
OCC together being the ``participating clearing organizations). The CME&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC program would involve
the cross-margining of positions in specified commodity futures, commodity options, and securities options (``eligible
contracts'') carried for, among others, certain market professional customers. These market professionals would
include CME members and firms owning CME memberships, members of exchanges cleared by ICC, and market makers, specialists,
and registered traders on securities options markets whose accounts would not be proprietary within the meaning
of Commission Regulation 1.3(y), 17 CFR 1.3(y), (``participating market professionals'') and whose positions
are carried by participating futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') that also are participating broker-dealers
(``B/Ds'') or by participating FCMs and their affiliated participating B/Ds which may also be FCMs (together ``participating
clearing firms''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act provides that the Commission shall approve contract market rules only if such rules
``are determined by the Commission not to be in violation of [the] Act or the regulations of the Commission.'' Commingling
of futures and non-futures funds of customers currently is not permitted under the Commission's regulations. Section
4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. &sect;6d(2), however, authorizes the Commission to issue an order prescribing the terms
and conditions under which ``money, securities, and property (received by an FCM to margin, guarantee or secure the
commodity futures trades or contracts of a customer) may be commingled *&blank;*&blank;* with any other money, securities,
and property received by such [FCM] and required by the Commission to be separately accounted for and treated and dealt
with as belonging to the customers of such [FCM].'' Accordingly, any proposal which would permit such commingling
would require Commission action pursuant to section 4d(2) of the Act, as well as Section 5a(a)(12)(A).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the CME&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC non-proprietary cross-margining proposal provides for calculation by the participating
clearing organizations of a single margin requirement to support the positions of participating market professionals
in eligible contracts carried by participating clearing firms; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission has reviewed the CME&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC cross-margining proposal; new ICC rules 514, 515, 516, 517,
518, 519, and 520; proposed amendments to ICC Rules 101, 301, 302, 513 and 614; the proposed agreement among the participating
clearing organizations; the proposed agreements among the participating clearing firms and the participating
clearing organizations; and the proposed agreements among the participating market professionals and participating
clearing firms submitted by letters dated September 21, 1992 through April 22, 1993; the representations of the participating
clearing organizations as to the operation of the program; the representations of the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (``SIPC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''); and such other documents as constitute
the complete record in this matter (``Record''); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the agreements among participating market professionals, participating clearing firms, and participating clearing
organizations require that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Each participating market professional acknowledge in writing that any money, securities or property, including
securities option positions, held on his behalf in a non-proprietary cross-margining account (``cross-margining
property'') will be treated in a manner consistent with the terms of this Order and any other applicable order issued
by the Commission; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that any cross-margining property
held on his behalf by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with a participating FCM will be customer
property deemed to be received by the participating FCM to be accounted for, treated, and dealt with by such FCM as belonging
to such market professional in a manner consistent with Section 4d of the Act;

(c) Each participating market professional agree in writing that, in the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation, or
receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution of funds held by a participating clearing firm against
which such market professional has a customer net equity claim in respect of the cross-margining property, such claim
shall be subordinated to the customer net equity claims of ``public customers,'' as that term is defined in Commission
Regulation 190.01(hh), 17 CFR 190.01(hh), of such clearing firm that do not relate to money, securities, or property
in any cross-margining account; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that cross-margining property held
for or on his behalf will not be customer property under the Federal securities laws to the extent necessary to effect
this Order and will not be customer property under Subchapter III of Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11

 and will not be claimed as such, and will be customer property under the Act, Subchapter IV of Chapter 7 of Title 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 761&hyph;766, and part 190 of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR part 190; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
each participating market professional which signs such a participant agreement will be a customer of a participating
FCM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 each participating clearing firm will treat money, securities, and property received in respect of all accounts
other than cross-margining accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Commission and the SEC appropriate
thereto; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIPC has represented that it has no objection to the agreements under which a participating market professional's
cross-margining property would not be deemed to be customer property for the purposes of SIPA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the SEC has concurred with the treatment of securities positions and cross-margining accounts set forth in this Order;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now Therefore, based on the Record in this matter, and provided that the cross-margining proposal submitted by CME
and ICC and related proposed rules and rule amendments submitted by ICC are implemented consistently with the representations
and agreements cited herein, and provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and participating market professional
execute the agreements referred to herein; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and depository separately account
for cross-margining property maintained in non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and not commingle such cross-margining
property with money, securities, and property maintained in any non-cross-margining accounts or proprietary cross-margining
accounts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, participating market professional,
and depository provide the Commission with access to its books and records with respect to non-proprietary cross-margining
accounts and positions in a manner consistent with Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each participating clearing firm include all cross-margining property received from participating market
professionals as provided herein to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts,
commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, or accruing to such participating market professionals
as a result of such trades, contracts, commodity option transactions or securities option transactions, when calculating
segregation requirements for the purposes of Section 4d of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Each participating clearing firm compute total segregation requirements under Section 4d of the Act and Commission
Regulation 1.32, 17 CFR 1.32, by calculating separately the requirements for cross-margining and non-cross-margining
accounts without using any net liquidating equity in one account to reduce a deficit in the other; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Each participating clearing firm designate non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and positions as such
in its books and records, including both internal documents maintained at the firms and account statements sent to
participating market professionals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Each participating clearing organization calculate the margin requirements for each non-proprietary cross-margining
account separately from the margin requirements for other accounts, including proprietary cross-margining accounts;
collect any margin required with respect to non-proprietary cross margining accounts separately without applying
any margin in any such account to satisfy a margin requirement in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account and without applying any margin in a non-cross-margining customer account to satisfy a margin requirement
in any proprietary account or any non-proprietary cross-margining account; and maintain all cross-margining property
received from participating clearing firms to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity
futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for non-proprietary
cross-margining accounts or held in such accounts, and all accruals resulting from such trades, contracts, commodity
option transactions, or securities option transactions, separately from money, securities, and property received
to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions,
or securities option transactions that are effected for or held in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account, and related accruals; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Each participating clearing organization satisfy any deficiency in a non-proprietary cross-margining account
without recourse to non-cross-margining segregated funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participating clearing firm may commingle cross-margining property maintained
in respect of the non-proprietary cross-margining arrangement among CME, ICC, and OCC with money, securities and
property maintained in respect of similar Commission-approved non-proprietary cross-margining arrangements
between CME and other commodity clearing organizations, between ICC and other commodity clearing organizations,
or between OCC and other commodity clearing organizations, and may apply such commingled money, securities, and
property to meet its obligations to a commodity or option clearing organization arising from trades or positions
held in its non-proprietary cross-margining account established pursuant to one or more of such cross-margining
arrangements, provided that the participating clearing firm:

cross-margining arrangements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>Trilateral Cross-Margining Program Among the Commodity Clearing Corp., the Intermarket Clearing Corp., and the
Options Clearing Corp.</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') and the Commodity Clearing Corporation (``CCC'') have submitted
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (``Act''), 7 U.S.C. 7a(a)(12)(A), and Commission Regulation 1.41(b), 17 CFR 1.41(b), a proposal to
implement a trilateral cross-margining program with The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') (CCC, ICC, and
OCC together being the ``participating clearing organizations''). The CCC&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC program would involve
the cross-margining of positions in specified commodity futures, commodity options, and securities options (``eligible
contracts'') carried for, among others, certain market professional customers. These market professionals would
include New York Cotton Exchange (``NYCE'') or FINEX members and firms owning NYCE or FINEX memberships, members
of exchanges cleared by ICC, and market makers, specialists, and registered traders on securities options markets
whose accounts would not be proprietary within the meaning of Commission Regulation 1.3(y), 17 CFR 1.3(y), (``participating
market professionals'') and whose positions are carried by participating futures commission merchants (``FCMs'')
that also are participating broker-dealers (``B/Ds'') or by participating FCMs and their affiliated participating
B/Ds which may also be FCMs (together ``participating clearing firms''). Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act provides
that the Commission shall approve contract market rules only if such rules ``are determined by the Commission not
to be in violation of [the] Act or the regulations of the Commission.'' Commingling of futures and non-futures funds
of customers currently is not permitted under the Commission's regulations. Section 4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6d(2),
however, authorizes the Commission to issue an order prescribing the terms and conditions under which ``money, securities,
and property [received by an FCM to margin, guarantee or secure the commodity futures trades or contracts of a customer]
may be commingled *&blank;*&blank;* with any other money, securities, and property received by such [FCM] and required
by the Commission to be separately accounted for and treated and dealt with as belonging to the customers of such [FCM].''
Accordingly, any proposal which would permit such commingling would require Commission action pursuant to section
4d(2) of the Act, as well as section 5a(a)(12)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the CCC&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC non-proprietary cross-margining proposal provides for calculation by the
participating clearing organizations of a single margin requirement to support the positions of participating
market professionals in eligible contracts carried by participating clearing firms; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Commission has reviewed the CCC&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC cross-margining proposal; the proposed agreement
among the participating clearing organizations; the proposed agreements among the participating clearing firms
and the participating clearing organizations; and the proposed agreements among the participating market professionals
and participating clearing firms submitted by letters dated April 7 through November 16, 1993; the representations
of the participating clearing organizations as to the operation of the program; the representations of the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''); and such other
documents as constitute the complete record in this matter (``Record''); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the agreements among participating market professionals, participating clearing firms, and participating
clearing organizations require that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Each participating market professional acknowledge in writing that any money, securities, or property, including
securities option positions, held on his behalf in a non-proprietary cross-margining account (``cross-margining
property'') will be treated in a manner consistent with the terms of this Order and any other applicable order issued
by the Commission; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that any cross-margining property
held on his behalf by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with a participating FCM will be customer
property deemed to be received by the participating FCM to be accounted for, treated, and dealt with by such FCM as belonging
to such market professional in a manner consistent with section 4d of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each participating market professional agree in writing that, in the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation, or
receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution of funds held by a participating clearing firm against
which such market professional has a customer net equity claim in respect of the cross-margining property, such claim
shall be subordinated to the customer net equity claims of ``public customers,'' as that term is defined in Commission
Regulation 190.01(hh), 17 CFR 190.01(hh), of such clearing firm that do not relate to money, securities, or property
in any cross-margining account; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that cross-margining property held
for or on his behalf will not be customer property under the Federal securities laws to the extent necessary to effect
this Order and will not be customer property under subchapter III of chapter 7 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11
U.S.C. 741&hyph;752 or the Securities Investor Protection Act (``SIPA''), 15 U.S.C. 78aaa

Whereas, SIPC has represented that it has no objection to the agreements under which a participating market professional's
cross-margining property would not be deemed to be customer property for the purposes of SIPA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the SEC has concurred with the treatment of securities positions and cross-margining accounts set forth
in this Order; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now Therefore, based on the Record in this matter, and provided that the cross-margining proposal submitted by CCC
and ICC is implemented consistently with the representations and agreements cited herein, and provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and participating market professional
execute the agreements referred to herein; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and depository separately account
for cross-margining property maintained in non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and not commingle such cross-margining
property with money, securities, and property maintained in any non-cross-margining accounts or proprietary cross-margining
accounts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, participating market professional,
and depository provide the Commission with access to its books and records with respect to non-proprietary cross-margining
accounts and positions in a manner consistent with Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each participating clearing firm include all cross-margining property received from participating market
professionals as provided herein to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts,
commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, or accruing to such participating market professionals
as a result of such trades, contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, when calculating
segregation requirements for the purposes of Section 4d of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Each participating clearing firm compute total segregation requirements under Section 4d of the Act and Commission
Regulation 1.32, 17 CFR 1.32, by calculating separately the requirements for cross-margining and non-cross-margining
accounts without using any net liquidating equity in one account to reduce a deficit in the other; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Each participating clearing firm designate non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and positions as such
in its books and records, including both internal documents maintained at the firms and account statements sent to
participating market professionals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Each participating clearing organization calculate the margin requirements for each non-proprietary cross-margining
account separately from the margin requirements for other accounts, including proprietary cross-margining accounts;
collect any margin required with respect to non-proprietary cross-margining accounts separately without applying
any margin in any such account to satisfy a margin requirement in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account and without applying any margin in a non-cross-margining customer account to satisfy a margin requirement
in any proprietary account or any non-proprietary cross-margining account; and maintain all cross-margining property
received from participating clearing firms to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity
futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for non-proprietary
cross-margining accounts or held in such accounts, and all accruals resulting from such trades, contracts, commodity
option transactions, or securities option transactions, separately from money, securities, and property received
to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions,
or securities option transactions that are effected for or held in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account, and related accruals; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participating clearing firm may commingle cross-margining property maintained
in respect of the non-proprietary cross-margining arrangement among CCC, ICC, and OCC with money, securities, and
property maintained in respect of similar Commission-approved non-proprietary cross-margining arrangements
between CCC and other commodity clearing organizations, between ICC and other commodity clearing organizations,
or between OCC and other commodity clearing organizations, and may apply such commingled money, securities, and
property to meet its obligations to a commodity or option clearing organization arising from trades or positions
held in its non-proprietary cross-margining account established pursuant to one or more of such cross-margining
arrangements, provided that the participating clearing firm: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Separately identify and account for the money, securities, and property held pursuant to each of the non-proprietary
cross-margining arrangements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

contracts, and otherwise required by the Commission to be segregated under the Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution
of funds held by a participating clearing firm, any customer net equity claim which a participating market professional
has in respect of cross-margining property held by such participating clearing firm in a non-proprietary cross-margining
account shall be treated as a customer net equity claim, under part 190 of the Commission's regulations and subchapter
IV of chapter 7 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, but shall be subordinated to the customer net equity claims of ``public
customers,'' as that term is defined in Commission Regulation 190.01(hh), of such clearing firm that do not relate
to cross-margining property.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant
to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award a cooperative agreement to University of
Oregon (UO). The award represents a continuation of DOE funded research for the UO to produce marketable industrialized
housing that is more energy efficient. Public Law 95&hyph;224 provides the statutory authority for the proposed
award.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
UO has been engaged in industrialized housing research for the last four years and has made successful advances to
produce marketable industrialized housing that is more energy efficient and has a lower operating and first cost
than conventional ``stick-built'' construction. Research under the cooperative agreement will provide needed
data to DOE and industry utilizing industrialized housing technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the financial assistance application is being accepted because the work to be funded is necessary to continue
activities presently being funded by DOE and the work will enhance the public benefit. DOE knows of no other entity
which is conducting such an activity in the near or distant future. The project period for the cooperative agreement
is expected to begin in November 1993 for a five year period. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $10,075,000
for this project period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy plans to evaluate options for future use of Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2, including
options for development of the conventional oil and natural gas resources that may be contained within these Reserves.
Reserve Number 1 occupies 41,000 acres in Garfield County, Colorado, and Reserve Number 2 occupies 90,000 acres in
Carbon and Uintah Counties, Utah. Approximately 40 percent of the Utah Reserve is included within the Uintah and Ouray
Indian Reservation. Two open hearings are planned to provide opportunity for public comment on possible, future
uses for these properties.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2 originally were set aside by Congress to furnish the Navy with a supply of fuel
in the event of a national emergency. Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 1 is estimated to have more than 18 billion barrels
of oil in place, with approximately 2.5 billion barrels of oil recoverable from shale rated at 30 gallons or more per
ton. Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 2 is estimated to have almost 4 billion barrels of shale oil in place. No estimate of
recoverable shale oil has been made. The Department of Energy has no current plans to develop the oil shale resources
of either Reserve No. 1 or Reserve No. 2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves' Strategic Plan recognizes that although development of shale oil has
been deferred, the potential for conventional oil and gas resources within the Naval Oil Shale Reserves properties
must be assessed and plans formulated to develop these resources in the near to mid-term. Based upon current and past
production from oil and gas fields located in the vicinities of the Naval Oil Shale Reserves, the potential for recovery
of substantial quantities of oil and natural gas from within the Reserves' boundaries is quite high. Options for development
of these resources includes partnerships with industry (lease or farmout), Federal development, or simply deferring
development, maintaining all or a portion of the properties as wilderness areas. Attendance at each of the two scheduled
hearings will be limited to sixty persons. Oral and/or written presentations are invited. Oral presentations will
be limited to five minutes each.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on December 17, 1993, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPSC) requested the Commission to disclaim
jurisdiction over a retail rate schedule CZ&hyph;1 under which WPSC served the Northern Mobile Home Court (Northern)
until November of 1993. WPSC provided the service to Northern under ``Option 2'' of rate schedule, which provides
that the customer may install its own meters at each trailer stall and rebill electric service to the tenant. WPSC asserts
that the service is clearly nonjurisdictional; however, WPSC wishes to be absolutely certain to avoid any late filing
penalties. If the Commission asserts jurisdiction, WPSC requests that the CZ&hyph;1 rate schedule be accepted for
filing and that the notice requirement be waived to allow that rate schedule to become effective as to the Northern
service on January 1, 1963, which is approximately when service to Northern commenced.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hereby gives notice of the final Outer Continental Shelf
air permit decision for the Chevron U.S.A. Production Company, Inc., Destin Dome Block 97 Exploratory Well. Destin
Dome Block 97 is located approximately 29 miles offshore of Pensacola, Florida. After due consideration of the facts
applicable to this Outer Continental Shelf source as they appear in the Administrative Record and the requirements
expressed in the Clean Air Act and appropriate regulations, the Regional Administrator has determined that the Outer
Continental Shelf air permit, OCS-FL&hyph;001, should be issued with the revisions incorporated since the preliminary
determination announced by the previous public notice for this permit (Public Notice Date: October 3, 1993). This
action constitutes EPA's final permit decision in accordance with Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR)
&sect;124.15(a). The permit will become effective as specified in this notice, provided that no timely request for
review under 40 CFR 124.19 is received by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person who filed comments on the draft Outer Continental Shelf permit or participated in the public hearing may
petition the Environmental Appeals Board to review any condition of the permit decision. Any person who failed to
file comments or failed to participate in the public hearing on the draft permit may petition for administrative review
only to the extent of the changes from the draft to the final permit decision. The petition shall include a statement
of the reasons supporting that review, including a demonstration that any issues being raised were raised during
the public comment period (including any public hearing) to the extent required by 40 CFR Part 124 and when appropriate,
a showing that the condition in question is based on a finding of fact or conclusion of law which is clearly erroneous,
or an exercise of discretion or an important policy consideration.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) intent to approve the lists submitted to
the U.S. EPA pursuant to Clean Water Act (CWA) section 303(d) by the State of New York, the State of New Jersey, and the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on September 4, 1992, May 20, 1993, and November 18, 1993, respectively. Please be advised
that the U.S. Virgin Islands is not required to submit a 303(d) list because there are no water quality-limited segments
in the U.S. Virgin Islands requiring Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL). EPA issued its intent to approve the New York
State September 4, 1992 list submittal on May 18, 1993. With regard to the New Jersey May 20, 1993 and the Puerto Rico
November 18, 1993 list submittals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although EPA has not yet sent out approval letters, EPA does intend to approve both of these list submittals as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of the Puerto Rico section 303(d) list, it should be noted that several modifications, which will affect
the Commonwealth's section 303(d) list, have been agreed upon by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (PREQB)
and EPA subsequent to the November 18, 1993 submittal. These proposed modifications reflect recent negotiations
between PREQB and EPA regarding 1994 permitting priorities in Puerto Rico. The current Puerto Rico section 303(d)
list does not reflect these specific modifications. Since the section 303(d) process is ongoing, another comprehensive
review/revision of all State section 303(d) lists is scheduled to take place in April, 1994. At that time the Puerto
Rico section 303(d) list will be updated to include all agreed upon modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting public comment on its intent to approve these 303(d) lists, which, together with EPA's tentative
approval documents, are available to the public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987, requires every State to: Identify
those waters within its boundaries for which the effluent limitations required by section 301(b)(1)(A) and section
301(b)(1)(B) of the CWA are not stringent enough to meet any water quality standard applicable to such waters. Each
State is required to identify the pollutants causing the impairment of the listed waters. Section 303(d) further
requires the State to establish a priority ranking for such waters, taking into account the severity of the pollution
and the designated uses of these waters. Finally, the State is required to identify waters targeted for TMDL development
over the next two (2) years. TMDLs establish the allowable pollutant loadings necessary for a waterbody to meet applicable
State water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State 303(d) lists and TMDLs are submitted to EPA for approval or disapproval. The deadline for submitting the above
lists to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was October 22, 1992 (See 57 FR 33047 (July 24, 1992)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with 40 CFR 130.7, New York, New Jersey and Puerto Rico submitted to EPA, for approval, their listing decisions
under section 303(d) on September 4, 1992, May 20, 1993, and November 18, 1993, respectively. EPA today notices its
intent to approve these lists and solicits public comment on both the intent to approve and on the lists. EPA is soliciting
comments on the New York, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico 1992 CWA section 303(d) lists and approvals. All future biennial
submissions of the 303(d) lists will provide for public comment at the State level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lists and approvals are available by mail or for public inspection at the EPA Region 2 office by appointment. To
request a copy of a list and/or approval, to make arrangements to examine the lists, or to submit comments, contact
the Agency representative identified above. Comments must be submitted within thirty (30) days of the publication
of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the close of the comment period, EPA will make a final determination on the State lists and will issue a response

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comments received. A copy of EPA's decision and response to comments document will be sent to all parties submitting
comments in response to this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The application of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) was received by EPA on
April 28, 1993. Several modifications were made to the application package, based on discussions between the EPA,
the DENR, and the Office of the Attorney General. The final changes, including the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement
by the Governor, were completed on August 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and the August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, EPA highlighted three issues upon which it specifically requested
public comment. These issues concerned unsigned complaints from the general public, penalty authority, and citizen
intervention in enforcement actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of South Dakota's application package were available for public review at the EPA Region VIII office and at
the DENR office in Pierre, South Dakota. Copies also could be purchased from the DENR at a cost of $10.00. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA provided copies of South Dakota's public notices to permitted facilities, tribal councils and tribal environmental
agencies, and environmental groups in South Dakota. The mailing list used is part of the record of the program application
and review process. By letter dated August 25, 1993, EPA provided copies of South Dakota's application to the U.S.
Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, and to the South Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the public comment process, EPA conducted two public hearings on South Dakota's application. The hearings
occurred on October 14, 1993 at the Matthew Training Center, Joe Foss Building, 523 East Capitol, Pierre, South Dakota,
beginning at 3 and 7 p.m. The first hearing lasted approximately one hour, and the second lasted about 45 minutes. The
register of those attending is contained in the administrative record. In addition, until October 22, 1993, EPA accepted
written comments from the public. All comments or objections presented at either public hearing or received in writing

Federal regulations at 40 CFR 123.26(b)(3) and (4) require a State approved to administer the NPDES program to maintain
a program for investigating information regarding violations of applicable program and permit requirements, to
maintain procedures for receiving and ensuring proper consideration of information submitted by the public about
violations of applicable program and permit requirements, to encourage public efforts in reporting violations,
and to make available information on reporting procedures.

 notice and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, Section 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 of the South Dakota Codified Laws (SDCL)
prohibits the DENR from performing inspections or conducting other investigatory activities pursuant to SDCL Sections
34A&hyph;2&hyph;40, 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, and 34A&hyph;2&hyph;45 based on, or as a result of, information received
from the general public unless the person providing the information signs a complaint, which is to remain confidential
with the DENR. The statement by the South Dakota Attorney General notes that information in complaints from the general
public made to another agency or DENR program and then referred to the DENR NPDES program is not considered ``as a result
of'' a complaint from the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has described the means by which it will consider and respond to NPDES-related information from the general
public and from other state governmental agencies. The DENR will investigate and respond to all citizen complaints
where a signed complaint form has been received and will investigate all complaints received from other government
agencies. At the time an unsigned complaint is received, DENR will determine whether appropriate department authorities
exist under any state environmental statute to handle the unsigned complaint. If not, the citizen shall be referred
to the South Dakota Department of Emergency and Disaster Services, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish &amp;
Parks, or another appropriate State agency. The appropriate State agencies shall receive anonymous complaints
and either investigate under their authorities or sign and refer the complaint to DENR. The process used for investigating
and responding to unsigned complaints will be published in major newspapers in South Dakota and will be prominently
posted in the main office and the field offices of the DENR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its oversight role, EPA has established a ``hotline'' (1&hyph;800&hyph;227&hyph;8917) to receive complaints,
both identified and anonymous, regarding NPDES-related activities in South Dakota. To communicate this fact to
the general public, EPA will publish the hotline number in the Rapid City ``Journal'' and the Sioux Falls ``Argus-Leader'',
as well as sending a notice to public interest groups and permitted facilities. The hotline number may be used by callers
who have information concerning a possible violation of an NPDES permit or program requirement. The caller will be
referred to a staff member of the EPA Region VIII NPDES Branch. This staff person will record the information received
and make a decision whether or not an investigation is needed. EPA may conduct the investigation or request that the
DENR investigate.

A. Comments in Support of Sec. 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those supporting South Dakota's system for addressing unsigned complaints included the DENR, municipal, agricultural,
and mining associations, municipalities, another State agency, and industrial dischargers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Several commenters questioned the motives of people who submit unsigned complaints and/or the merits of such complaints.
They referred to the right to face one's accusers. Their comments included:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few persons stated that unsigned complaints result from feuds, cranks, or competitors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two expressed the opinion that if a complaint is genuine, the person making it should have the commitment to sign it.
A representative of an agricultural group that identified itself as the prime sponsor of Sec. 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111
stated that ``there should be a great deal of responsibility laid at the feet of those people making the complaint *&blank;*&blank;*.
[South Dakota is] a stand-up place *&blank;*&blank;* South Dakota newspapers, by and large, don't accept letters
to the editors that are unsigned. South Dakota State agencies, by and large, do not accept letters of complaint or phone
calls that are anonymous. South Dakota Attorney General's office does not accept complaints that are anonymous,
with some exceptions.'' Two commenters stated that a person is entitled to face his accusers and is protected from
anonymous harassment. One of them cited the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Some commenters indicated that the state government and the regulated community should be protected from unsigned
complaints: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One city official noted that unsigned complaints can have a detrimental effect upon an organization otherwise trying
to work cooperatively to achieve compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* an anonymous phone call or letter is too easy a method to trigger an environmental audit *&blank;*&blank;*.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``[Section] 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 is a necessary statute that helps to limit the expenditure of staff time on frivolous
personal grudge type complaints.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Some commenters praised DENR's record in conducting investigations and allowing for public participation. They
also noted the existence of the EPA ``800'' number. Their remarks included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary, DENR, asserted in his written statement: ``To our knowledge, since the passage of this law [SDCL Section
34A&hyph;2&hyph;111], this law has never hindered our ability to address water pollution incidents nor has it hindered
public involvement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* the current SDCL Section 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 is working very well. DENR is very responsible
in investigating complaints and has a system in place to guarantee that investigations take place once a complaint
arises and to keep the identity of the party making the complaint confidential.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters referred to the fact that EPA is maintaining an ``800'' number for persons not wishing to communicate
with the state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Several commenters indicated that the state's system provides sufficient opportunity for public participation
and agency investigation of complaints. They supported this point by identifying three ways in which Section 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111
was restricted in its applicability: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The prohibition applies to complaints from the general public, not to complaints made or passed on by another federal,
state or local level of government. If DENR determines that it lacks authority to investigate a complaint, the complaint
is then referred to another agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The prohibition does not apply to the state's mining laws, solid waste laws, and hazardous waste laws. Most complaints
from factory workers will relate to hazardous waste violations, which are not covered by this prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The prohibition does not apply to DENR's right of entry, to the issuance of an emergency order, to determinations
of responsibility for discharges, to waste disposal into state waters, and to more general authorities to investigate
violations of Chapter 34A&hyph;2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those opposing South Dakota's system for handling unsigned complaints included environmental groups and individuals
working in municipal facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Some commenters stated that people hesitate to sign complaints because they fear reprisals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An anonymous individual who described himself or herself as a ``person employed in the wastewater and pretreatment
field in the State of South Dakota'' stated, ``Many times people are reluctant to sign complaints because of some type
of repercussion.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``It is a reality that many individuals are reluctant to report suspected or obvious discharge violations for fear
of reprisal. Real or perceived, it is a reality.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An environmental group (which stated that it had recently concluded a successful citizen's suit against a mining
company in South Dakota) commented that it had filed written complaints with the DENR based on anonymous tips that
it, rather than the DENR, had received. Citizens had been reluctant to file a complaint even if it was considered ``confidential.''
This group also stated that it had never found any citizen complaint to be frivolous or harassing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several commenters criticized the process for investigating and responding to unsigned complaints, described
in Item E.4. on page 7 of the MOA. Their comments included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The MOA should contain unequivocal language setting forth a specific procedure for SDDENR to follow for maintaining
(1) an investigation of violations and (2) procedures for ensuring proper consideration of information from the
public about violations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``We do find fault, at times, with the depth and timeliness of the `investigation' conducted by DENR upon our filed
complaints. Investigations conducted several days to weeks after a complaint is filed may miss a violation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``In South Dakota, with its small population and overlapping networks of personal and business relationships, unsigned
complaints_if they are seriously considered by SDDENR are likely to be the most fruitful sources of violation reporting.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``It is not clear *&blank;*&blank;* whether department authorities exist within SDDENR to appropriately handle
unsigned citizen complaints if referred by another State agency.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. We do not consider it
appropriate to burden other State agencies whose administrative and field staff are already clearly overworked.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Any unsigned complaint will simply fall into the cracks between agencies and nothing will be done.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The Departments of Agriculture and Game, Fish and Parks do not have authority or expertise for dealing with complaints
that are properly the concern of SDDENR.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Some commenters indicated that SDCL prevented South Dakota's application from meeting pertinent authorization
requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``We believe neither SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 nor EPA's proposed solution meets the requirements of Section 402(b)(2)(B)
and Section 402(b)(7) of the Clean Water Act, and 40 CFR Sections 123.26(b)(3) and (4) *&blank;*&blank;*. EPA should
withhold NPDES delegation until SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 is repealed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The requirements of forty (sic) CFR Sections 123.26(b)(3) and (4) will not be met under the MOA because of the convoluted
nature of provisions for receiving and dealing with unsigned complaints.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Some commenters stated that the state's procedure for handling unsigned complaints created the impression that
the state favored special interests over the general public: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``If there's a problem, [most citizens] want action, no matter whom they call. For a citizen to be told they have to call
another agency to get a water problem addressed just confirms [the] citizen's view of government as controlled by
special interests who get laws like 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 approved *&blank;*&blank;*. State government should
not be empowered by EPA to cripple or make more difficult and confusing citizens' ability to work directly with the
proper state regulators because of paranoia on the part of the special interests who are regulated under water quality
laws.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two individuals commented in a letter that they were ``appalled of (sic) the manner in which the State intends on handling
or rather not handling citizen complaints and the legalese double talk the State Attorney General's office is trying
to portray as meaningful procedures.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. EPA's Response to Comments on Sec. 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has a program and procedures for public reporting of violations that ensures their proper consideration,
even though the existence of &sect;34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 appears to require a more cumbersome process than is desirable.
EPA might propose a simpler program or procedures for a hypothetical ``model'' state program. However, under the
Clean Water Act, a State is provided flexibility in achieving the minimum requirements of the Act, including those
for public participation. If approached by another state on suggestions for public reporting, EPA would recommend
against inclusion of a Section 111-type provision. EPA encourages South Dakota to repeal Section 111 as inefficient
and having the potential to limit the discretion of the very state agency entrusted to exercise enforcement discretion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA doubts that facilities subject to DENR investigations could use Section 111 as a means to avoid the consequences
for failing to comply with &sect;34A&hyph;2&hyph;40, &hyph;44, and &hyph;45. DENR investigators are not required
by any provision of state law to identify the basis for the information leading to investigation. Moreover, DENR has
authority to initiate prosecution based on verified information. Notwithstanding questions about enforceability,
DENR has indicated its intention to faithfully implement applicable provisions of state law, as well as to implement
public participation procedures to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 123.27(d). EPA encourages DENR to periodically
evaluate the effectiveness of its public reporting procedures in providing public participation in the NPDES enforcement
program in South Dakota, particularly in light of the existence of Section 111.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fact that the prohibition in 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 does not apply to complaints from governmental entities or
to other State environmental programs provides the State some options for the general public to use in reporting concerns
about possible violation or problems related to wastewater treatment or effluent. The description of the State process
will be published in major newspapers in South Dakota and posted in the DENR offices located throughout the State.
Therefore, mechanisms exist to ensure proper consideration of information from the general public and are sufficient
to meet the minimum requirements of public participation consistent with 40 CFR 123.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA acknowledges there may be some delay in investigation of information received from the general public because
of the requirement for a signed complaint. South Dakota has explained, however, that the requirement should not unduly
delay prompt investigation when the member of the general public indicates a willingness to identify himself or herself
and sign a complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The volume of unsigned complaints which are received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any one entity is not expected to be so great that it would strain the resources available to that organization. However,
the DENR is responsible for assuring whatever resources needed to respond to unsigned complaints are available,
as well as providing adequate resources to administer the NPDES program as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that the adequacy and effectiveness of DENR's public reporting requirements are easily verified, both
by EPA and the general public. If the described procedures do not, in practice, provide for adequate and effective
public reporting, DENR's compliance with public reporting requirements may be reexamined. Should subsequent administrative
or judicial interpretations of Section 111 broaden its scope from that described in the program submission or otherwise
impair implementation of the public reporting procedures, EPA may reevaluate whether the existence of Section 111
yet enables DENR to adequately administer the NPDES program.

Motives of Anonymous Tipsters, Rights of the Accused, and Complainant Fear of Reprisal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA does not dispute that some complaints may be submitted with questionable motives or that signed complaints may
often be more credible than unsigned ones. ``Crank'' calls may be from disgruntled neighbors or business competitors.
However, a statute is not needed to eliminate the problems associated with frivolous calls. The DENR has professionally
trained staff capable of screening out such calls, based on the information provided or not provided. Such calls are
also possible from persons who do sign their names. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fact that the prohibition applies only to the general public and not to other governmental entities allows the
NPDES program to use information referred to it by these entities. This information may be provided as problems the
entities have identified in the course of their duties (including accepting referrals). It may also come from problems
identified by complainants to other entities about their programs which contain information also applicable to
the NPDES program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the rights of the accused, the Sixth Amendment right to face accusers applies in criminal cases when the
testimony of an informant is to be used in trial. However, if an informant's tip is independently confirmed by a law
enforcement agency and the testimony of the informant is not needed at trial, then any rights under this amendment
have not been affected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fear of reprisal may occur even in situations where a person does not have to provide a name, since in small communities
it might be fairly easy to figure out or at least narrow down the persons likely to have reported the information. In
addition, employees may fear reprisal from their employers should they report possible violations of NPDES statutes,
regulations, or permit conditions. However, such fears may be diminished by the fact that SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111
requires the identity of the complainant to be kept confidential.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A frivolous claim may place a strain on an organization trying to cooperate. However, the potential for strain is offset
by the potential to promote the general good which complaints may provide the State in identifying and correcting
problems early on. Also, it would seem that there would be few instances of complaints being merely frivolous or harassing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is always the chance that actions by governmental entities may be misconstrued by the general public. This is
not a basis for determining a program does not meet the requirements for delegation. However, this is an issue both
the SDDENR and the EPA will be sensitive to as they administer and oversee the NPDES program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of South Dakota is a sparsely populated state with relatively few industries. Moreover, the existence of
overlapping business and personal networks provides an opportunity for someone removed from a situation to provide
information instead of someone concerned about retaliation from an employer. South Dakota's small population and
overlapping networks may be productive sources of information. These networks can work to the advantage of the NPDES
program in that possible NPDES violations, particularly those affecting surface waters may be reported in connection
with information supplied to other environmental programs. For example, according to the DENR, the DENR Ground Water
program has the lead on spills and contacts the NPDES staff when there is a potential for surface waters to be affected.
The Mining program will generally receive any tips regarding mining problem spills/discharges (e.g. cyanide) and
share them with the NPDES staff. Game Fish &amp; Parks recently referred a case of a discharge without a permit to the
DENR. That agency also uses its own authority when the discharge is in the area of a fishery. All of these programs are
not affected by the prohibition in SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 and, in the past, have received and forwarded complaints
which also related to NPDES-related activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concern expressed that information may fall between the cracks is a valid one. It is possible this could occur in
any process for receiving information sources outside the administering office. However, the system established
for investigating and responding to complaints provides that the DENR will investigate and respond to all citizen
complaints where a signed complaint form has been received and will investigate all complaints received from other
government agencies.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA determines that the procedure South Dakota has established is adequate to comply with the Clean Water Act and with
NPDES federal regulations. South Dakota has established a process to deal with issues raised by the general public
by accepting signed complaints and being required to keep the identity of the source confidential and by referring
other complaints to another State agency. The Governor, as a signatory to the MOA, has committed to follow the process
for receiving and responding to information from sources outside the State NPDES program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though section 111 may not provide an adequate program for public reporting in other states or for other programs,
under the particular circumstances of the DENR NPDES program, the state procedures are adequate for the following
reasons: (1) South Dakota is not heavily industrialized, (2) the prohibition pertains only to water programs and
not other media programs, (3) the state is sparsely populated for the most part, (4) the right of entry (&sect;34A&hyph;2&hyph;46)
is not impaired, (5) the prohibition provision does not appear to be directly enforceable by dischargers, and (6)
the State NPDES program retains the authority to respond in emergencies (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;68), to enforce against
persons causing pollution of waters (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;21), and to conduct investigations to determine the responsible
person for causing a discharge which may cause or has caused pollution of state waters (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;71.1)
regardless of the source of information leading to these actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation in South Dakota is such that there are overlapping networks of state agencies and there are active environmental
groups which will identify issues on behalf of their membership and of individuals who communicate information and
concerns to their groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that anonymous tips are just one source of complaints, albeit a significant source. The statute does not
place restrictions on any other sources of information or other activities than those defined in 34A&hyph;2&hyph;40,
&hyph;44, and &hyph;45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA oversight includes an hotline number (1&hyph;800&hyph;227&hyph;8917) to receive complaints from all sources.
Oversight also includes monitoring the DENR process and results from public participation in compliance and enforcement.
If there appears to be a problem, EPA will revisit this aspect of the program with DENR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 402(b)(2)(B) of the CWA requires an authorized state program to have authority to inspect, monitor, enter,
and require reports to at least the same extent as required by section 308 of the CWA. Section 402(b)(7) of the CWA requires
an authorized state program to have adequate authority to abate violations of permits or the permit program through
penalties and other means of enforcement. EPA State NPDES program requirements at 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i) provide

 notice and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, South Dakota does not have direct statutory authority to collect civil
penalties, or criminally enforce, a failure to comply with SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44 (record-keeping), 34A&hyph;2&hyph;45
and &hyph;46 (inspection authorities), due to a lack of citation to SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;75 (penalty provision)
in these sections. However, because the Department [of Environment and Natural Resources] can prosecute (both civilly
and criminally) violations of permit conditions and because it can set permit conditions for recording, reporting,
monitoring, entry, and inspection under 34A&hyph;2&hyph;40, it can enforce these statutes for permitted facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department can, with regard to unpermitted facilities, obtain both the records and entry for inspections pursuant
to search warrants issued on the basis of the criminal provisions of SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;75 and the violation of
SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;36 (operating without the required permit). Civil penalties for failure to comply with SDCL
34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46 by an unpermitted facility are available only through violation of
an order issued by the Department pursuant to SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;53.

A. Comments Favoring Existing Penalty Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DENR and various members of the regulated community expressed opinions that the lack of a direct authority to impose
penalties for violations of the cited statutes would have little affect on the ability of the State to exact penalties
for failure to comply with the statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter from the regulated community thought that no detrimental effects would be expected and, therefore,
the system for collecting penalties was adequate until such time as the matter was corrected by the legislative process.
The Secretary of the DENR noted that the Attorney General's Statement indicated that reporting requirements will
be included in the permit, and are therefore enforceable for permitted facilities. As to unpermitted facilities,
the Secretary of the DENR (who would be the party issuing orders) stated that the DENR could issue an enforcement order
in a timely manner to require any necessary reporting or sampling and that the DENR could enforce these orders. The
Secretary also cited a recent water pollution enforcement case settlement which included a penalty of $489,000 and
was accomplished without the authority to enforce any NPDES condition or requirement. He stated that delegation
would only increase the abilities of the DENR to enforce violations of the state's environmental laws. Another state
agency noted that ``It appears&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* that the case where this EPA concern would be applicable
is for facilities that are discharging without a permit and not keeping records. For these facilities, failure to
have a permit would be a more severe violation than the failure to keep records.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter thought that penalties for items normally found in a permit should not begin to accrue for an unpermitted
facility until after the state issues an order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those who criticized the existing authority were the pretreatment coordinator for a municipal treatment facility
and one environmental group. They questioned the ability of the authority to stand up to judicial review and the round-about
means the DENR would have to use to exercise the authority in collecting penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed the opinion that the state's authority to collect penalties from unpermitted facilities
is not clear, particularly in light of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
lawsuit. In that case, the court found that Mr. Freeman's civil rights were violated when, upon refusing State health
inspectors entry, he was served with a closure order. The commenter stated that the finding was made because the citation
under licensure statutes failed to cite an enforcement provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An environmental group indicated that the State's roundabout legal reasoning to support its authority to obtain
records and entry to inspect at unpermitted facilities may be overlooked by a judge faced with what appears to be a clear
failure to provide for criminal and civil sanctions for record-keeping or inspection violations. Specific penalty
provision language must be added to 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46 in order to comply with 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another environmental organization stated that the state should have direct statutory authority to collect civil
penalties and to criminally enforce a failure to comply with Sec. 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44. They also noted that the MOA
should require South Dakota to adopt less round-about methods to obtain records and entry and to be able to do so without
the DENR having to issue an order. They believed that formal issuance of orders and search warrants can take too much
time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's authorization regulations require civil penalties to be recoverable for the violation of any NPDES permit
condition; any NPDES filing requirement; any duty to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities;
or any regulation or orders issued by the State Director. See 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i). The State has demonstrated an
adequate authority and methodology for collecting penalties from permitted and unpermitted facilities. However,
EPA would recommend a legislative amendments to 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46 to define failure to
comply with each as a violation enforceable through 34A&hyph;2&hyph;53. These amendments would allow a more direct,
and thereby more effective, implementation of the enforcement program.

Adequacy of the Ability To Recover Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has shown that legal mechanisms exist for exacting penalties tied to permitted and unpermitted facilities
which fail to comply with SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46. The authorities used are not specifically
based on a violation of these statutes. However, they do provide for 'civil penalties to be recoverable' for refusal
to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities, which is what 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i) requires.

does not apply to the State's authority to collect penalties for refusals to allow the state to inspect potential water
pollution violations. In that case, State inspectors had summarily terminated a campground's license because the
campground's operator would not allow the state to inspect without a warrant. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Freeman
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, civil rights were violated because the State inspectors lacked statutory enforcement authority. In the Case of
South Dakota NPDES, SDDENR does have adequate statutory authority to issue administrative orders. The South Dakota
Attorney General has stated South Dakota has adequate statutory authority to implement the program described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ignorance of the law is not an argument for deferring penalties. The regulated community is notified through public
notice of the requirements for permits, right of entry, etc. It is their responsibility to be aware of these requirements
and be accountable for them from the time the requirements become effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the penalty for failure to have a permit might be more severe than for a failure to keep records by itself.
However, both requirements are normally available to the regulator in taking enforcement actions. The existence
of a penalty for a discharge without a permit does not, by itself, offset the need for a mechanism to collect penalties
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring requirements. As noted earlier, such a mechanism exists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the date at which a violation begins, the State has asserted that administrative orders or search warrants
could be issued within one or two days. Therefore, the number of days of violation used to calculate penalties for unpermitted
facilities would be almost the same as for permitted facilities. In cases where a discharge causes pollution of any
waters of the state, the penalty can be calculated for each day the discharge occurred as a violation of 34A&hyph;2&hyph;21,
subject to a &sect;34A&hyph;2&hyph;75 order. The number of days of violation is just one factor applied in calculating
penalties. The small difference in the number of days of violation between permitted and unpermitted facilities
could be offset by the presence of other factors in calculating and negotiating the final penalty (e.g. the existence
of another violation -discharge without a permit). Therefore, the immediate revision of SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44,
&hyph;45, and &hyph;46 is not required. However, EPA does consider such revisions desirable, so that the State would
have more direct remedies for these violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that EPA, in its oversight role, can take enforcement action. Typically, EPA would send to the
State a Notice of Violation and give the State 30 days to take action. If the State were not to take sufficient action,
including not collecting a large enough penalty, EPA could file an order and collect penalties from the date the violations
started. Citizen suits are also a means to assure appropriate penalties are collected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA finds that the penalty authority and process for collecting penalties is adequate and serves as a protection against
noncompliance with water pollution control law, rules, and permits. EPA's oversight role offers a second level of
protection. A third level of protection is offered by related statutes, such as prohibiting discharges which may
cause or cause pollution of waters of the state (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;21), prohibiting discharge of waste or pollutants
without a permit (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;36), and prohibiting reduction of existing water quality (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;22).
Therefore, the DENR NPDES program adequately meets the requirements for recovering penalties.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices requested public comment on South Dakota's statutory procedure for citizen
intervention in administrative enforcement actions, as required by 40 CFR 123.27(d). South Dakota has certified
that it allows intervention as of right in administrative enforcement actions pursuant to SDCL Sec. 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2.
It has indicated that Sec. 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2, considered alone, appears to grant merely ``permissive intervention'';
that is, intervention if no other party objects). However, South Dakota has also certified that if a citizen is denied
intervenor status in an administrative case, he may file a lawsuit in circuit court to have the court order him to be
named as a party in the administrative proceeding, pursuant to Sec. 34A&hyph;10&hyph;5. Because of the possibility
for such a circuit court proceeding, South Dakota's Attorney General construes SDCL 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2 to allow
mandatory intervention in administrative procedures. The Memorandum of Agreement, a document signed both by the
State of South Dakota and the EPA, states that the SDDENR will allow intervention as of right in civil proceedings to
at least the same extent required by 40 CFR 123.27(d)(1) and shall not oppose intervention in administrative proceedings
as provided by &sect;34A&hyph;10&hyph;2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Members of the regulated community commented that the statutory procedure afforded citizens an adequate right of
intervention. One specific comment, made by a member of the regulated community, was that the State assurance in the
MOA makes the citizen right to intervention mandatory. This commenter also noted that the Attorney General Statement
interprets SDCL 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2 to mean that the citizen's right to intervene is mandatory.

B. Comments Opposing Existing Intervention Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental groups and individual citizens criticized the existing intervention procedure and its application
by the DENR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Some commenters stated that intervention rights were not being honored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One environmental group stated that it was ``*&blank;*&blank;* especially concerned about the problems posed *&blank;*&blank;*
by the progressive subtle and not so subtle deterioration of participation by citizens and non-profit citizens organizations
in quasi-judicial hearings.'' It referred to individual citizens being ignored at public hearings, public documents
being unavailable for review and comment before a contested case hearing, and decisions being given little publicity.
One individual commented that at a public hearing in the Fall of 1992 he ``*&blank;*&blank;* watched (and objected)
as BME Board members subverted the rules of that hearing by allowing a mining industry lawyer take control of the hearing.
Board members allowed the attorney to cross examine citizens as if they were under oath when the citizens were simply
there to testify on their own behalf. The incidents are a matter of record. They are also quite typical of DENR.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another environmental group cited instances where it or individual citizens were excluded from permit modification,
remediation, and negotiation processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another individual citizen's letter provided comments which ``*&blank;*&blank;* center[ed] on the State of South
Dakota's continued and specific efforts to stifle and judicially dissuade individuals from pursuing environmental
issues. They concluded that ``[O]bviously, the state of South Dakota has little understanding of citizen participation
and rights to involvement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Politically powerful applicants regularly 'short-circuit' the contested case procedure with active help from
the Attorney General and the DENR. In several controversial cases *&blank;*&blank;* DENR and/or the applicant have
used various procedures to obtain 'quickie hearings' designed to thwart due process and a fair hearing. One state
board, at the urging of the Attorney General, *&blank;*&blank;* carved out a novel justification, citing SDCL 1&hyph;22&hyph;27,
that allows applicants the right to short-circuit the contested case process.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``A circuit court remedy for denial of intervenors status is NO remedy because of expense and unwieldiness.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Commenters expressed the concern that public interest and environmental groups must be represented by an attorney
at contested cases hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An environmental group stated that DENR has denied them intervention in administrative hearings if they are not represented
by an attorney. They noted that the State's application does not clearly state whether an attorney is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Public interest groups must be represented by an attorney at contested case hearings. Since hardly any of us can
afford such, the public interest has rarely been represented in the past few years.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The Board [of Minerals and the Environment] [h]as so decreed, and the state Attorney General's office has rendered
an opinion of agreement that only attorney's (sic) can present cases before the Board if the group appearing before
the Board is an association, corporation, or other similar entity. The Board has effectively prevented environmental
groups from appearing before the Board without the considerable expense of an attorney. It is our understanding that
other State Boards do not have the attorney requirement.''

C. EPA's Response to Comments Concerning Intervention Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has determined that DENR intervention authority and procedures adequately meets the requirement of 40 CFR 123.27(d).
Citizen intervention rights will be honored. There is currently no requirement for public interest groups to be represented
by attorneys at NPDES contested case proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Honoring Intervention Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The great majority of the comments expressing concerns with the application of intervention rights pertained to
non-NPDES State program topics (e.g. mining, sewage ash, landfills) and a State board (Board of Minerals and Environment)
which will not administer the NPDES program in South Dakota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Dakota statutes, rules, and program documents provide citizen access to information. SDCL 1&hyph;27&hyph;1
specifically allows for open inspection of all records and documents during normal business hours. The MOA (page
7, item E.1) provides public access to NPDES files during normal working hours. Public notice of proposed general
permits, major permits, and pretreatment program applications is provided for in the MOA (page 7, item E.3) and the
Program Description (page 9). South Dakota Rule 74:03:13:02 requires the DENR to public notice any contested case
hearing requested and the reasons for the hearing. The public notice of any proposed settlement of a State enforcement
action is required only when the authority which allows intervention as of right is not demonstrated (see 40 CFR 123.27(d)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General Statement construes the language of SDCL 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2 concerning intervention to be
mandatory. In addition, both the MOA (page 3, item A.13) and the Program Description (page 19) allow for citizen intervention
as of right in civil proceedings equivalent to that required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 123.26(d)(1).

Representation by an Attorney 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The South Dakota Bar Association has issued an ethics opinion that appearance before administrative agencies on
behalf of corporations or associations must be by licensed attorneys. The ruling concerning representation at contested
case hearings was in reference to contested case hearings held by the Board of Minerals and Environment. The requirement
for representation by an attorney does not appear to apply to the NPDES program. However, even in the case of the Board
of Minerals and Environment, the Board does not exclude individual citizens from full participation at hearings,
but applies the requirement for legal representation of organizations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DENR clarified in an addendum to the MOA regarding the NPDES program that individual members of the general public
and nonprofit organizations shall not be required to be represented by attorneys in NPDES program contested case
hearings to the extent allowed by the State Bar Association and the State Supreme Court. EPA believes that a state bar
association does not have the authority to direct the policies and procedures of a state agency which derives its authority
from the state legislature. EPA does recognize that a state bar association can constrain the activities of individual
attorneys employed by a state agency. In its oversight role, EPA will monitor future rulings of the South Dakota Bar
Association and the State Supreme Court regarding citizen intervention and whether environmental organizations
are being required to be represented by attorneys. If either of these occur, EPA will consider the impact these rulings
and requirements have on the viability of the State's NPDES enforcement program.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, EPA withheld from NPDES program authorization consideration those lands
which were in Indian Country or for which there was significant controversy over whether or not the land was Indian
Country. As noted earlier, EPA provided copies of South Dakota's public notices to tribal councils and tribal environmental
agencies. Tribal governments and affected permittees were also provided with copies of the list of permitted facilities
which EPA would continue to administer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In withholding authorization for these areas, EPA was not making a determination as to whether or not South Dakota
had adequate jurisdiction. This issue was considered deferred. Nevertheless, a number of comments were received
regarding jurisdiction. No comments were received from tribal councils or tribal environmental organizations.

A. Comments Regarding EPA's Continued Administration of the NPDES Program in Indian Country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a member of the regulated community, stated that EPA's retaining authority within the identified
Indian Reservations should lighten the load for SDDENR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters however, disagreed with EPA's administering the program in Indian Country or land in controversy.
Some of the comments were the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* EPA is asserting a jurisdictional authority which it cannot for regulatory and resource reasons,
carry out; the result is inconsistent environmental protection, and some geographical areas left without environmental
protection *&blank;*&blank;* If EPA insists that it carve out geographical areas of the state which should not have
equal environmental protection, then I want to make it very clear that the State of South Dakota will further pursue
the issue of jurisdiction on non-Indian lands within reservation boundaries.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``To the extent that EPA retains authority over facilities located on lands other than retained Indian allotments,
we believe EPA violates the holding *&blank;*&blank;* [that] exclusive tribal and federal jurisdiction is limited
to the retained allotments *&blank;*&blank;* We believe the better policy, at least as it applies to former reservation
areas, is to grant the State authority unless the Tribe can show authority for the dischargers being within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Tribe or federal government.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``We feel South Dakota has demonstrated its intent and ability to administer programs fairly in the entire state.
Therefore, the SDDENR should administer the NPDES program throughout the State. The department will need to work
closely with tribal governments. Splitting the non-Federal responsibilities could result in ineffective protection
of the waters of the state.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A state agency expressed concern that the split in administering the program would cause confusion.

This issue was deferred until a satisfactory demonstration of jurisdiction over Indian Country is made by the State
of South Dakota or another governmental entity. Otherwise, delegation of any part of the program would have to be held
up pending a lengthy resolution of this complicated issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While a number of comments were received regarding jurisdiction, this issue is deferred until such time as an appropriate
analysis is made of the State's authority to assert jurisdiction over lands for which EPA is retaining jurisdiction.
EPA will specifically mail copies of public notices of future assertions to those who provided comments, so they may
make their comments during the appropriate public comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that EPA has prepared a list of NPDES-permitted facilities which will continue to be administered
by EPA. Operators or owners of facilities subject to the NPDES program which are located on these lands should continue
to send original or renewal permit applications to EPA. They will be notified of this at the time all permittees are
notified of the program authorization decision. Persons with questions as to whether their facilities may be in Indian
Country are advised to consult with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the EPA.

V. Pretreatment Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A state pretreatment program must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 403.10(f) before being approved for program administration
by the EPA. Under 40 CFR 403.10(f)(1)(i) and 403.3(j), an approved state program must have the authority to require
industrial users to comply with pretreatment standards for specific industrial subcategories, as established
by EPA regulations in 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, ``Effluent Guidelines and Standards.'' When South Dakota submitted
its proposed program to EPA, subchapter N had not been incorporated into the State program. However, incorporation
was approved at the July 28, 1993, public hearing of South Dakota Water Management Board and became effective on September
5, 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a pretreatment program manager, expressed concerns and raised questions regarding the clarity of
the pretreatment program procedures and the level of resources needed by the DENR to administer the pretreatment
program: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``1. I feel DENR must elaborate and develop a procedure for entering into a joint powers agreement with a municipality
in order for DENR to run a municipal pretreatment program. There is nothing in the submission that indicates the extent
to which DENR will administer the program, especially if a large municipality requests the Department run their program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does DENR have the authority to flatly refuse to administer a municipal pretreatment program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If DENR issues a SWD Permit to a POTW and mandates the development of a pretreatment program, can the POTW in turn request
the State to administer the program? If so, what are the procedures for requesting that DENR administer the program?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Assuming the State becomes delegated, what is the timeframe for previously approved pretreatment programs to
submit notice to the DENR that the POTW wishes to continue administering the program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. I honestly feel that if ONE of the larger POTW's [sic] request that DENR administer their pretreatment program,
along with all of the other smaller POTW pretreatment responsibilities the state will assume, the Department will
not have enough personnel to adequately administer this program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second commenter proposed that the following be added to the administrative rules: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``74:03:26_A POTW that intends to discharge wastewater to a separate POTW which is under a different authority must
submit a request for approval to the Secretary at least 90 days prior to discharge. The Secretary must evaluate the
impact of industrial user wastes on contributing POTW and receiving POTW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary may choose one of the following options to protect both POTWs from significant industrial user discharges:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Require contributing jurisdiction to establish a Pretreatment Program in accordance to [sic] the requirements
in 40 CFR Part 403.8(a) and the State provide direct oversight over program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State implement a POTW Pretreatment Program in lieu of the contributing jurisdiction as set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR Part 403.8(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Control all significant industrial users in the contributing jurisdiction directly by conditions established
in 74:03:26:03 to 74:03:26:14 and the State of SD Pretreatment Program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. EPA's Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ARSD Section 74:03:26:02 and Section V of the Program Description provide for development of a joint powers agreement
in cases where a POTW required to develop a pretreatment program has requested the DENR to assume pretreatment program
requirements. This request is to be made within 30 days of notification that the State has been delegated the pretreatment
program or within 30 days of the facility being notified that it is required to develop a pretreatment program. In the
latter case, this notification would be made either at the time of issuance of an NPDES permit with such a requirement
or the conclusion of an enforcement action imposing such a requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that any POTW can request that the State assume responsibility for a local pretreatment program, subject
to implementation of an agreed-upon joint powers agreement. It appears that the DENR may refuse to administer a program
only if no joint powers agreement is developed within forty-five days after notification of intent by the POTW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the DENR should provide more detailed instructions to POTWs regarding the joint powers agreement
process. This can be done at the time the POTW requests the DENR to administer its pretreatment program, since the procedures
may vary somewhat depending on the extent and content of local legal authorities and procedures at each facility when
the request is received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DENR will be required upon authorization to supply whatever resources are necessary to ensure that all pretreatment
program activities are fully implemented and enforced. DENR staff are knowledgeable about the resources required
to implement a program. SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;120 provides for the DENR to collect annual fees from, not only the POTW
for which it administers the pretreatment program ($35,000), but each pretreatment industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
user ($600 plus up to $1,600 per process line for analytical testing). These fees, plus any legislative appropriations,
would be the financial basis for DENR administering the overall state pretreatment program and individual programs
with which it has joint powers agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the proposed rule changes, EPA finds additional rules are not needed to provide the State the authority
to require a POTW to develop a pretreatment program or to request that the DENR administer the program in lieu of the
POTW. The State is not required to offer POTWs the option to develop or have programs developed at POTWs which do not
meet the criteria contained in 40 CFR 403.8(a), as seems to be suggested by the second commenter's proposed rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pretreatment program described adequately meets the requirements of 40 CFR 403.10(f). The Program Description
outlines the process for joint powers agreements. EPA recognizes that the specific steps for developing joint powers
agreements between the DENR and an individual POTW may vary according to the situation at each municipality. EPA will
continue to play a significant review and oversight role in the development and implementation of joint powers agreements.

VI. Endangered Species Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our August 25, 1993 letter to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), EPA initiated informal consultation
under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on EPA's proposal to authorize the DENR to administer the NPDES
Program under section 402 of the Clean Water Act in South Dakota. The FWS responded to EPA on October 20, 1993. EPA responded
to that letter with a letter on November 19, 1993 describing permitting and variance procedures and providing a biological
assessment of the impact of program authorization on endangered and threatened species in South Dakota delineated
in the FWS October 20th letter. The November 19th letter also stated that EPA believed that the delegation would have
no effect on the listed species. Responding in its November 30, 1993 letter to the EPA, the FWS indicated that it could
concur with our no adverse effect finding if EPA agreed to four conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and DENR staff met with staff at the FWS South Dakota Field Office in Pierre to discuss the conditions. Based on that
meeting, the EPA and DENR agreed to these conditions, as follows. FWS concurred on EPA's Finding of No Adverse Affect
on December 15, 1993. The MOA between EPA and South Dakota on the administration of the South Dakota NPDES program addressed
these conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In each individual public notice or variance, the State shall make an initial determination of effect on all federally
listed endangered and threatened species that may occur in the project area of influence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This information will be provided to the Service as well as to the EPA with sufficient time to review and, if necessary,
provide comments, as reflected in the Memorandum of Agreement signed between EPA and the State of South Dakota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State will communicate with the Service, on a periodic basis, on the permits that it will be issuing. The
Service will work with the State to identify those permits for which there are species in the project area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If it is determined by the State that the individual permit or variance to the permit provided to the Service may adversely
affect any federally listed and/or proposed endangered and threatened species, the State will work with the Service
to eliminate the adverse affect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If the Service does not concur with the State's ``no affect'' determination, the State will work with the Service
to eliminate the adverse effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If any adverse effects cannot be eliminated, the permit application or variance will be held in abeyance and the
EPA, with their oversight responsibilities, will require consultation with the Service, after EPA has completed
the formal objection process and the permit has reverted to EPA for issuance.

VII. Overall Delegation Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a number of public comments regarding the overall capability and intent of the DENR to administer an authorized
NPDES program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Comments Regarding the Benefits of Delegation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Many commenters praised the capabilities, competency, knowledge, and past performance of the DENR staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;we have relied on the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural resources
as a resource for questions and concerns we have had with the NPDES program. We have found the DENR to be staffed by a group
of well-informed professionals dedicated to the enhancement of water quality. Their guidance and advice have always
been valuable&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The DENR has established itself as a very competent department and has a very positive working relationship with
a variety of industries within the state. The DENR will be very effective in administering and enforcing the NPDES
program for the State of South Dakota *&blank;*&blank;* we haven't always agreed with DENR on our positions, but let
me say clearly we have always been treated very fairly.'' ``To me, the State seems very capable of making decisions
and taking action, while at the Federal level, response does not occur with promptness.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``We are aware of the efforts the Department made prior to and during the 1992 State Legislative session to secure funding
needed to upgrade staff capability to take over management of the NPDES program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* environmental regulations are best administered at the state level. State administration
provides both the permittee and the regulator better opportunity for face to face communication and for better understanding
of the specifics of an operation through regular inspections. Administration and enforcement are both enhanced
by having the regulators in close proximity to the regulated facilities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Numerous commenters emphasized the advantages of regulation by an agency actually in the State. Comments included
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``EPA technical staff are normally available by phone only, while state staff are frequent visitors to the area and
are available for valuable on-site assistance&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*. Our experience in working with [a delegated
state regarding other facilities] has been one where positive environmental benefits have been achieved in an efficient,
timely manner. We deal directly and in person with all the regulatory people involved, which drastically reduces
the questions of interpretation, improves timeliness of permit compliance and in the end provides quicker, effective
solutions to environmental problems.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``I believe that delegation of the NPDES program for regulating the discharges of pollutants into waters within the
State will mean a more effective operation on both a programmatic and cost basis.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``We are as concerned for the environment of our employees as much as anyone else is, but we have a desire for cooperation
rather than dictation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``I believe a program administered by the state of South Dakota, with regional offices in efforts to help industry
clean up our environment, should we be polluting it, would be a tremendous benefit to all manufacturers.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Having the answers in state and accountable to South Dakotans will enhance businesses' ability to comply.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``[The State Feedlot Program Regulation Review]&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*. Committee concluded that State management
of the NPDES program was needed to accomplish effective regulation of feedlot wastes in South Dakota.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The National Performance Review recently cited recommendations to create a system of program delivery that works
better and costs less. The very first recommendation (EPA01) specifically states: `Improve Environmental Protection
Through Increased Flexibility for Local Government'. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has a real
opportunity today to act on this recommendation by approving South Dakota's application!'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``There are several reasons why the Legislature supported this [Second Century Environmental Protection] Act:

B. Comments Opposing Authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters identified problems associated with delegation, both in public participation issues and
in other areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``If [program authorization] were to happen, South Dakota citizens, although they might not know it, would be without
protection.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``DENR's activities last year demonstrate clearly the agency's tendency toward advocacy for, rather than regulation
of, the entities it is, by law, required to oversee *&blank;*&blank;*. [This group] seeks denial of state delegation
until the philosophy of DENR changes from that of advocate for the regulated community to one of regulator.'' An environmental
group criticized the state's commitment to enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An environmental group requested that EPA require monitoring data to be submitted and housed at DENR. They also suggested
that issued and denied permits require equivalent levels of clearances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. EPA's Response to Comments on Overall Authorization Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA noted and considered all public comments considering the overall advantages and disadvantages of approving
the NPDES program administration by the State of South Dakota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the comments reflected the advantage of State program approval which the Clean Water Act envisioned: the program
can be administered more effectively closer to the regulated community when the agency and its staff are competent
and committed to protecting the environment and public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources to be used meet the minimum requirements of the NPDES program as it now exists. The State would be responsible
for devoting the resources needed to maintain this program and implement additional requirements, as they occur.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's responses to public participation issues are found under the sections on ``Unsigned Complaints'' and ``Citizen
Intervention''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA typically does not require submission of monitoring data other than discharge monitoring reports (DMRs) when
it administers the NPDES program in a state. Therefore, it does not require an approved state to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appears that there are equivalent levels of clearance for permit issuance and denial. In both cases, the Secretary
makes that decision. This is noted in the flow chart on page 9 of the Program Description. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of South Dakota has demonstrated that it adequately meets the requirements for program authorization as
defined in the Clean Water Act, 40 CFR part 123, and 40 CFR part 403. The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service concurred with
the EPA ``no adverse affect'' determination regarding program authorization. The State Historic Preservation
Office concurred with the EPA ``no effect'' determination. This authorization does not include the sludge management
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, EPA is withholding authorization to administer the NPDES program on Indian Country located within South
Dakota, including lands for which there is significant controversy over whether or not the land is Indian Country.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of entities. The proposed approval of the South Dakota NPDES
program does not alter the regulatory control over any industrial category. No new substantive requirements are
established by this action. Therefore, because this notice does not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not needed.

 FCC Form 405 is used by all common carriers and Multipoint Distribution Service non-common carriers to apply for renewal
of radio station licenses. Section 307(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 limits the terms of common carrier radio
licenses to ten years and requires that written applications be submitted for renewal. Applicants granted developmental
and special temporary authority are required to apply for renewal in shorter intervals_usually one year after date
of grant and annually thereafter. FCC Form 405 has been revised to incorporate a certification required by the Commission's
rules implementing the provisions of Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Licensing Branches evaluate
the information submitted; review the particulars and conditions of the current authorization; and take action
to renew the license for a new term. If the information were not submitted, the Commission would not be able to carry
out its responsibilities mandated by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the
Presiding Officer in this proceeding shall be issued by January 6, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall
be issued by May 8, 1995.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is the fourth annual report
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 on the differences in capital standards and accounting practices that currently exist among the three banking agencies
(the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Section One of the report focuses on differences in the agencies' capital standards; Section Two discusses differences
in accounting standards. The remainder of this introduction provides an overview of the discussion contained in
these sections.

1 The first two reports prepared by the Federal Reserve Board were made pursuant to section 1215 of the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). The third report was made pursuant to section 121 of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), which superseded section 1215 of FIRREA.

2 At the federal level, the Federal Reserve System has primary supervisory responsibility for state-chartered banks
that are members of the Federal Reserve System as well as all bank holding companies. The FDIC has primary responsibility
for state nonmember banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks. National banks are supervised by the OCC. The OTS has
primary responsibility for savings and loan associations.

Capital Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the previous reports to the Congress, the three bank regulatory agencies have, for a number of years, employed
a common regulatory framework that establishes minimum capital adequacy ratios for commercial banking organizations.
In 1989, all three banking agencies as well as the OTS, adopted a risk-based capital framework that was based upon the
international capital accord developed by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices
(Basle Accord) and endorsed by the central bank governors of the G-10 countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk-based capital framework establishes minimum ratios of total and Tier 1 (core) capital to risk-weighted
assets. The Basle Accord requires banking organizations to have total capital equal to at least 8 percent, and Tier
1 capital equal to at least 4 percent, of risk-weighted assets after a phase-in period which ended on December 31, 1992.
Tier 1 capital is principally comprised of common shareholders' equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock,
less disallowed intangibles such as goodwill. The other component of total capital, Tier 2, may include certain supplementary
capital items, such as general loan loss reserves and subordinated debt. The risk-based capital requirements are
viewed by the three banking agencies and the OTS as minimum standards, and most institutions are expected to, and generally
do, maintain capital levels well above the minimums.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to specifying identical ratios, the risk-based capital framework implemented by the three banking agencies
includes a common definition of regulatory capital and a uniform system of risk weights and categories. While the
minimum standards and risk weighting framework are common to all the banking agencies, there are some technical differences
in language and interpretation among the agencies. The OTS employs a similar risk-based capital framework although
it differs in some respects from that adopted by the three banking agencies. These differences, as well as other technical
differences in the agencies' capital standards, are discussed in Section One of this report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the risk-based capital requirements, the agencies also have established leverage standards setting
forth minimum ratios of capital to total assets. As discussed in Section One, the three banking agencies employ uniform
leverage standards, while the OTS has established, pursuant to FIRREA, somewhat different standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staffs of the agencies meet regularly to identify and address differences and inconsistencies in their capital
standards. The agencies are committed to continuing this process in an effort to achieve full uniformity in their
capital standards. In this regard, Section One contains discussions of the banking agencies' efforts during the
past year to achieve uniformity with respect to the risk categories of certain assets, specifically, identifiable
intangible assets, loans to finance construction of 1- to 4-family residential homes that have been pre-sold, and
multifamily housing loans. In addition, the agencies have worked together to revise the risk-based capital requirements
as required by provisions of section 305 of FDICIA to take account of interest rate risk and risks arising from concentrations
of credit and nontraditional activities. Finally, staffs of the agencies have been meeting in 1993 to discuss a uniform
draft proposal that would amend their risk-based capital guidelines to provide for recognition of bilateral netting
arrangements associated with rate contracts that genuinely reduce credit risk.

Accounting Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, the three banking agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council (FFIEC), have developed Uniform Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) for all commercial banks
and FDIC-supervised savings banks. The reporting standards followed by the three banking agencies are substantially
consistent, aside from a few limited exceptions, with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as they are
applied by commercial banks.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The uniform bank Call Report serves as the basis for calculating risk-based capital and leverage ratios, as well as
for other regulatory purposes. Thus, material differences in regulatory accounting and reporting standards among
commercial banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks do not exist.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
3 In those cases where bank Call Report standards are different from GAAP, the regulatory reporting requirements
are intended to be more conservative than GAAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS requires each thrift institution to file the Thrift Financial Report (TFR), which is consistent with GAAP
as it is applied by thrifts. The TFR differs in some respects from the bank Call Report. One reason is that thrift GAAP
is different in a few limited areas from GAAP as it is applied by banks; another, as previously mentioned, is that there
are a few minor areas in which the bank Call Report departs from bank GAAP. A summary of the differences between the bank
Call Report and the TFR is presented in Section Two.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the past year, the three banking agencies and the OTS have continued to undertake projects that seek to simplify
and reduce differences in reporting standards between commercial banks and thrift institutions. On June 10, 1993,
the four agencies announced six initiatives to implement the President's March 10 program to improve the availability
of credit to businesses and individuals. These initiatives included changes to regulatory reporting requirements,
all of which are consistent with GAAP. In this respect, the agencies separately issued guidance to banks and thrifts
that generally conforms regulatory reporting requirements for sales of Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) with GAAP,
as set forth in FASB Statement No. 66. These changes generally eliminated a 10 percent minimum down payment requirement
needed by the borrower/purchaser to record a sale of OREO for regulatory reporting purposes. In addition, as part
of these initiatives, the agencies issued joint policies on restoring nonaccrual loans to performing status and
improving the reporting guidance on insubstance foreclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these actions end the first phase of the President's credit availability program, the agencies are continuing
efforts to reduce paperwork and regulatory burdens. These efforts include considering the remaining few differences
between GAAP and regulatory accounting principles. In this regard, the agencies now have projects under way that
are to refine and improve policies and addresses a few differences that currently exist among the agencies, including
projects on recourse, netting, and hedging.

Section One
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differences In Capital Standards Among Federal Banking and Thrift Supervisory Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Leverage capital ratios
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies employ a leverage standard based upon the common definition of Tier 1 capital contained
in their risk-based capital guidelines. These standards, established in the second half of 1990 and in early 1991,
require the most highly-rated institutions to meet a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 3 percent. For all other institutions,
these standards generally require an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points, i.e., a minimum leverage
ratio of at least 4 to 5 percent, depending upon an organization's financial condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by FIRREA, the OTS has established a 3 percent core capital ratio and a 1.5 percent tangible capital leverage
requirement for thrift institutions. However, the OTS is in the process of finalizing a new leverage rule that will
generally conform to the rules of the three banking agencies. The differences that will exist after the OTS has adopted
its new standard pertain to the definition of core capital. While this definition generally conforms to Tier 1 bank
capital, certain
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments discussed below apply to the core capital definition used by savings associations. In addition, core
capital as currently defined by the OTS includes qualifying supervisory goodwill. Such goodwill is to be phased out
of thrift core capital by the end of 1994, after which time the treatment of goodwill for thrift institutions will be
consistent with that of the banking agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Risk-based capital ratios
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital standards consistent with the Basle Accord. These standards,
which were fully phased in at the end of 1992, require all commercial banking organizations to maintain a minimum ratio
of total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of 8 percent. Tier 1 capital comprises common stockholders'
equity, qualifying perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill.
Tier 1 capital must comprise at least 50 percent of the total risk-based capital requirement. Tier 2 capital includes
such components as general loan loss reserves, subordinated term debt, and certain other preferred stock and convertible
debt capital instruments, subject to appropriate limitations and conditions. Risk-weighted assets are calculated
by assigning risk weights of 0, 20, 50, and 100 percent to broad categories of assets and off-balance sheet items based
upon their relative credit risks. The OTS has adopted a risk-based capital standard that in most respects is similar
to the framework adopted by the banking agencies. Beginning with year-end 1992, the OTS standard requires a minimum
risk-based capital ratio equal to 8 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the banking agencies view the risk-based capital standard as a minimum supervisory benchmark. In part, this is
because the risk-based capital standard focuses primarily on credit risk; it does not take full or explicit account
of certain other banking risks, such as exposure to changes in interest rates. The full range of risks to which depository
institutions are exposed are reviewed and evaluated carefully during on-site examinations. In view of these risks,
most banking organizations are expected to operate with capital levels well above the minimum risk-based and leverage
capital requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Reserve has for some time been working with the other U.S. banking agencies and the regulatory authorities
on the Basle Supervisors' Committee to develop possible methods to measure and address certain market and price risks.
In April, 1993, the Basle Supervisors' Committee issued a consultative paper that addresses, among other items,
proposals to include certain risks into the framework of the Basle Accord. These risks include exposures resulting
from imbalances between the maturity of debt instruments held as assets and issued as liabilities and holdings of
traded debt and equity securities. One important reason for addressing these risks on an international level is to
develop supervisory approaches that do not undermine the competitiveness of U.S. banking organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding this initial effort, the OTS capital standards for some time have taken into account interest rate
risk and the FRB, OCC and FDIC sought public comment on a proposed framework for incorporating into their capital standards
interest rate risk in August, 1992, as required under section 305 of FDICIA. In response to concerns raised and recommendations
made by commenters, on September 14, 1993, the three banking agencies issued for public comment a substantially modified
proposal on interest rate risk. The approach ultimately adopted by the banking agencies could differ from that already
taken by the OTS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305 of FDICIA also requires the banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital rules to take account of
concentrations of credit risk and nontraditional activities. During 1993 the staffs of the four agencies met regularly
to draft proposals for public consideration. Final proposals are expected to be issued in the first part of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to coordinating their efforts to implement section 305, the agencies also worked together to eliminate
differences in their capital standards, as well as to revise their standards in response to legislative mandates,
accounting changes, and industry concerns. In this regard, during 1993, the three banking agencies eliminated the
principal difference in their capital standards when they issued final rules revising those standards with regard
to the types of intangible assets that may be included in the Tier 1 capital calculation for risk-based and leverage
capital purposes. Specifically, under these final rules, banking organizations may include in capital purchased
mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs), but are required to deduct from
capital core deposit intangibles (CDIs) and other identifiable intangible assets. The final rule also included
limits and discounts that are applicable to PMSRs and PCCRs in capital. The OTS draft final rule, which is consistent
with the final rule issued by the other agencies, is currently under review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another difference the federal banking agencies worked to eliminate during 1993 was the risk-based capital treatment
of multifamily housing loans. While the three banking agencies assign multifamily housing loans (5 units or more)
to the 100 percent risk category, the OTS allows certain multifamily mortgage loans to qualify for the 50 percent risk
category. This would apply, for example, to loans secured by buildings with 5-36 units (as described below). This
effort was undertaken pursuant to section 618 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring,
and Improvement Act of 1991 (RTCRRIA), which requires the agencies to lower the risk weight for multifamily housing
loans meeting certain criteria from 100 to 50 percent. At the time of this report, final rules have not been issued by
the agencies, although it is anticipated that they will be uniform and will be issued in the very near future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 618 of the RTCRRIA also required the agencies to revise their risk-based capital guidelines to lower from
100 percent to 50 percent the risk category for certain construction loans for presold 1- to 4-family residential
properties. During 1993, the four agencies issued similar final rules implementing this provision of section 618.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staffs of the four agencies also have been coordinating the issuance of uniform proposals to include in Tier 1 capital
the net unrealized changes in value of securities available for sale for purposes of calculating the risk-based and
leverage capital ratios of banking organizations. This proposal effectively would result in the adoption, for regulatory
capital purposes, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accountant Standards
No. 115 (FASB 115), ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.'' It is expected that the
agencies will issue proposals for public comment in the very near term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to industry recommendations, and in conjunction with the Basle Supervisors' Committee consultative
paper issued in April, 1993, the staffs of the four agencies have been meeting to draft uniform rules which would amend
their risk-based capital standards with regard to bilateral netting arrangements. Specifically, the proposals
would seek public comment on whether to recognize for risk-based capital purposes bilateral netting arrangements
associated with interest and foreign exchange rate contracts. Such netting arrangements would have to genuinely
reduce credit risk and be enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions as evidenced by well-founded and reasoned legal
opinions. It is anticipated that the agencies will issue proposals on this matter early in 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differences among the risk-based capital standards of the OTS and the three banking agencies are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain collateralized transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 23, 1992, the Federal Reserve Board issued, after an appropriate public comment period, an amendment
to its risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for state member banks and bank holding companies that lowers from
20 to 0 percent the risk category for collateralized transactions meeting certain criteria. This preferential treatment
is only available for claims collateralized by cash on deposit in the bank or by securities issued or guaranteed by
OECD central governments or U.S. government agencies. In addition, a positive margin of collateral must be maintained
on a daily basis fully taking into account any change in the banking organization's exposure to the obligor or counterparty
under a claim in relation to the market value of the collateral held in support of that claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC, on August 18, 1993, issued a proposal for public comment that would also lower the risk weight for certain collateralized
transactions. The FDIC and OTS are considering similar proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Equity investments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are not permitted to invest in equity securities,
nor are they generally permitted to engage in real estate investment or development activities. To the extent that
commercial banks are permitted to hold equity securities (for example, in connection with debts previously contracted),
the three banking agencies generally assign such investments to the 100 percent risk category for risk-based capital
purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the three banking agencies' rules, the agencies may, on a case-by-case basis, deduct equity investments from
the parent bank's capital or make other adjustments, if necessary, to assess an appropriate capital charge above
the minimum requirement. The banking agencies' treatment of investments in subsidiaries is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS risk-based capital standards require that thrift institutions deduct certain equity investments from capital
over a phase-in period, which ends on July 1, 1994, as explained more fully below in the section on subsidiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
FSLIC/FDIC - covered assets (assets subject to guarantee arrangements by the FSLIC or FDIC)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies generally place these assets in the 20 percent risk category, the same category to which
claims on depository institutions and government-sponsored agencies are assigned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS places these assets in the zero percent risk category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Limitation on subordinated debt and limited-life preferred stock
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the Basle Accord, the three banking agencies limit the amount of subordinated debt and limited-life
preferred stock that may be included in Tier 2 capital. This limit, in effect, states that these components together
may not exceed 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. In addition, maturing capital instruments must be discounted by 20 percent
in each of the last five years prior to maturity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither of these capital components is a permanent source of funds, and subordinate debt cannot absorb losses while
the bank continues to operate as a going-concern. On the other hand, both components can provide a cushion of protection
to the FDIC insurance fund. Thus, this limitation permits the inclusion of some subordinated debt in capital, while
assuring that permanent stockholders' equity capital remains the predominant element in bank regulatory capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS has no limitation on the total amount of limited-life preferred stock or maturing capital instruments that
may be included within Tier 2 capital. In addition, the OTS allows thrifts the option of: (1) discounting maturing
capital instruments, issued on or after November 7, 1989, by 20 percent a year over the last 5 years of their term -- the
approach required by the banking agencies; or (2) including the full amount of such instruments provided that the
amount maturing in any of the next seven years does not exceed 20 percent of the thrift's total capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsidiaries
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the Basle Accord and long-standing supervisory practices, the three banking agencies generally
consolidate all significant majority-owned subsidiaries of the parent organization for capital purposes. This
consolidation assures that the capital requirements are related to all of the risks to which the banking organization
is exposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with most other bank subsidiaries, banking and finance subsidiaries generally are consolidated for regulatory
capital purposes. However, in cases where banking and finance subsidiaries are not consolidated, the Federal Reserve,
consistent with the Basle Accord, generally deducts investments in such subsidiaries in determining the adequacy
of the parent bank's capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines provide a degree of flexibility in the capital treatment of
unconsolidated subsidiaries (other than banking and finance subsidiaries) and investments in joint ventures and
associated companies. For example, the Federal Reserve may deduct investments in such subsidiaries from an organization's
capital, may apply an appropriate risk-weighted capital charge against the proportionate share of the assets of
the entity, may require a line-by-line consolidation of the entity, or otherwise may require that the parent organization
maintain a level of capital above the minimum standard that is sufficient to compensate for any risks associated with
the investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines also permit the deduction of investments in subsidiaries that, while consolidated for accounting
purposes, are not consolidated for certain specified supervisory or regulatory purposes. For example, the Federal
Reserve deducts investments in, and unsecured advances to, Section 20 securities subsidiaries from the parent bank
holding company's capital. The FDIC accords similar treatment to securities subsidiaries of state nonmember banks
established pursuant to Section 337.4 of the FDIC regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, in accordance with Section 325.5(f) of the FDIC regulations, a state nonmember bank must deduct investments
in, and extensions of credit to, certain mortgage banking subsidiaries in computing the parent bank's capital. (The
Federal Reserve does not have a similar requirement with regard to mortgage banking subsidiaries. The OCC does not
have requirements dealing specifically with the capital treatment of either mortgage banking or securities subsidiaries.
The OCC, however, does reserve the right to require a national bank, on a case-by-case basis, to deduct from capital
investments in, and extensions of credit to, any nonbanking subsidiary.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deduction of investments in subsidiaries from the parent's capital is designed to ensure that the capital supporting
the subsidiary is not also used as the basis of further leveraging and risk-taking by the parent banking organization.
In deducting investments in, and advances to, certain subsidiaries from the parent's capital, the Federal Reserve
expects the parent banking organization to meet or exceed minimum regulatory capital standards without reliance
on the capital invested in the particular subsidiary. In assessing the overall capital adequacy of banking organizations,
the Federal Reserve may also consider the organization's fully consolidated capital position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the OTS capital guidelines, a distinction, mandated by FIRREA, is drawn between subsidiaries that are engaged
in activities that are permissible for national banks and subsidiaries that are engaged in ``impermissible'' activities
for national banks. Subsidiaries of thrift institutions that engage only in permissible activities are consolidated
on a line-by-line basis if majority-owned and on a pro rata basis if ownership is between 5 percent and 50 percent. As
a general rule, investments, including loans, in subsidiaries that engage in impermissible activities are deducted
in determining the capital adequacy of the parent. However, investments, including loans, outstanding as of April
12, 1989, to subsidiaries that were engaged in impermissible activities prior to that date are grandfathered and
will be phased-out of capital over a transition period that expires on July 1, 1994. During this transition period,
investments in subsidiaries engaged in impermissible activities that have not been phased-out of capital are to
be consolidated on a pro rata basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Qualifying multifamily mortgage loans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies currently place multifamily mortgage loans (five units or more) in the 100 percent risk
weight category. Historically, when compared to loans secured by mortgages on 1- to 4-family residences, which generally
are assigned to the 50 percent risk category, the credit risk associated with multifamily mortgage loans, unless
conservatively underwritten and seasoned, is more akin to that experienced on commercial property loans, which
are assigned to the 100 percent risk category. The OTS allows certain multifamily mortgage loans to qualify for the
50 percent risk category. This would apply, for example, to loans secured by buildings with 5-36 units, provided these
loans have a maximum 80 percent loan-to-value ratio and an 80 percent occupancy rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to Section 618(b) of the RTCRRIA, the three banking agencies and the OTS were directed to amend their risk-based
capital guidelines to lower the risk weight of certain multifamily housing loans, and securities backed by such loans,
from 100 percent to 50 percent. The section specifies several criteria that a multifamily housing loan must satisfy
in order to qualify for a 50 percent risk weight. These criteria are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The loan is secured by a first lien;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The ratio of the principal obligation to the appraised value of the property, that is, the loan-to-value ratio,
does not exceed 80 percent (75 percent if the loan is based on a floating interest rate);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The annual net operating income generated by the property (before debt service) is not less than 120 percent of
the annual debt service on the loan (115 percent if the loan is based on a floating interest rate);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The amortization of principal and interest occurs over a period of not more than 30 years and the minimum maturity
for repayment of principal is not less than seven years; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All principal and interest payments have been made on time for a period of not less than one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Section 618(b) also provides that multifamily housing loans accorded a 50 percent risk weight must meet
any underwriting characteristics that the appropriate Federal banking agency may establish, consistent with the
purposes of the minimum acceptable capital requirements to maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have proposed revisions to their capital standards to meet the requirement of section 618(b). It is anticipated
that final rules implementing section 618(b) will be issued by the respective agencies in the very near future.

Nonresidential construction and land loans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies assign loans for real estate development and construction purposes to the 100 percent
risk category. Reserves or charge-offs are required, in accordance with examiner judgment, when weaknesses or losses
develop in such loans. The banking agencies have no requirement for an automatic charge-off when the amount of a loan
exceeds the fair value of the property pledged as collateral for the loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS generally assigns these loans to the 100 percent risk category. However, if the amount of the loan exceeds 80
percent of the fair value of the property, that excess portion must be deducted from capital in accordance with a phase-in
arrangement, which ends on July 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies, in general, place privately-issued MBSs in a risk category appropriate to the underlying
assets but in no case to the zero percent risk category. In the case of privately-issued MBSs where the direct underlying
assets are mortgages, this treatment generally results in a risk weight of 50 percent or 100 percent. Privately-issued
MBSs that have government agency or government-sponsored agency securities as their direct underlying assets are
generally assigned to the 20 percent risk category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS assigns privately-issued high quality mortgage-related securities to the 20 percent risk category. These
are, generally, privately-issued MBSs with AA or better investment ratings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, both the banking and thrift agencies automatically assign to the 100 percent risk weight category
certain MBSs, including interest-only strips, residuals, and similar instruments that can absorb more than their
pro rata share of loss. The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the other banking agencies and the OTS, issued, on
January 10, 1992, more specific guidance as to the types of ``high risk'' MBSs that will qualify for a 100 percent risk
weight.

Assets sold with recourse
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, recourse arrangements allow the purchaser of an asset to ``put'' the asset back to the originating institution
under certain circumstances, for example if the asset ceases to perform satisfactorily. This, in turn, can expose
the originating institution to any loss associated with the asset. As a general rule, the three banking agencies require
that sales of assets involving any recourse to be reported as financings and that the assets be retained on the balance
sheet. This effectively requires a full leverage and risk-based capital charge whenever assets are sold with recourse,
including limited recourse. The Federal Reserve generally applies a capital charge to any off-balance sheet recourse
arrangement that is the equivalent of a guarantee, regardless of the nature of the transaction that gives rise to the
recourse obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exception to this general rule involves pools of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages and to certain farm mortgage
loans. Certain recourse transactions involving these assets are reported in the bank Call Report as sales, thereby
removing these transactions from leverage ratio calculations. These transactions, which are the equivalent of
off-balance sheet guarantees, involve the type of credit risk that is addressed by bank risk-based capital requirements,
although some questions in this regard have been raised because of the treatment afforded these transactions for
leverage purposes. The Federal Reserve has clarified its risk-based capital guidelines to ensure that recourse
sales involving residential mortgages are to be taken into account for determining compliance with risk-based capital
requirements. The FDIC clarified its guidelines on this matter in 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the OTS also requires a full capital charge against assets sold with recourse. However, in the case of limited
recourse, the OTS limits the capital charge to the lesser of the amount of recourse or the actual amount of capital that
would otherwise be required against that asset, that is, the normal full capital charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some securitized asset arrangements involve the issuance of senior and subordinated classes of securities against
pools of assets. When a bank originates such a transaction by placing loans that it owns in a trust and retaining any
portion of the subordinated securities, the banking agencies require that capital be maintained against the entire
amount of the asset pool. When a bank acquires a subordinated security in a pool of assets that it did not originate,
the banking agencies assign the investment in the subordinated piece to the 100 percent risk-weight category. The
Federal Reserve carefully reviews these instruments to determine if additional reserves, asset write-downs, or
capital are necessary to protect the bank.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS requires that capital be maintained against the entire amount of the asset pool in both of the situations described
in the preceding paragraph. Additionally, the OTS applies a capital charge to the full amount of assets being serviced
when the servicer is required to absorb credit losses on the assets being serviced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, the three banking agencies and the OTS, under the FFIEC, issued for public comment a fact finding paper pertaining
to the wide range of issues relating to recourse arrangements. These issues include the definition of ``recourse''
and the appropriate reporting and capital treatments to be applied to recourse arrangements, as well as so-called
recourse servicing arrangements and limited recourse. The objective of this effort was to develop a comprehensive
and uniform approach to recourse arrangements for capital adequacy, reporting, and other regulatory purposes.
The comments received were very extensive and generally illustrated the extreme complexity of the subject. In view
of the project's significance and complexity, the FFIEC in December 1990 decided to narrow the scope of the initial
phase of the recourse project to credit-related risks, including the appropriate treatment of credit-related recourse
arrangements that involve limited recourse or that support a third party's assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recourse working group, composed of representatives from the member agencies of the FFIEC, presented a report and
recommendations to the FFIEC in August 1992 and were directed to carry out a study of the impact of their recommendations
on depository institutions, financial markets, and other affected parties. The interagency group carried out this
study in early 1993. As a result of that study, the working group has revised several of their recommendations to reflect
market practice. Proposals for public comment are expected to be issued shortly.

Agricultural loan loss amortization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the computation of regulatory capital, those banks accepted into the agricultural loan loss amortization program
pursuant to Title VIII of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 are permitted to defer and amortize losses incurred
on agricultural loans between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1991. The program also applies to losses incurred between
January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1991, as a result of reappraisals and sales of agricultural Other Real Estate Owned
(OREO) and agricultural personal property. These loans must be fully amortized over a period not to exceed seven years
and, in any case, must be fully amortized by year-end 1998. Thrifts are not eligible to participate in the agricultural
loan loss amortization program established by this statute.

Treatment of junior liens on 1- to 4-family properties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, a banking organization may make two loans on a single residential property, one loan secured by a first
lien, the other by a second lien. In such a situation, the Federal Reserve views these two transactions as a single loan,
provided there are no intervening liens. This could result in assigning the total amount of these transactions to
the 100 percent risk weight category, if, in the aggregate, the two loans exceeded a prudent loan-to-value ratio and,
therefore, did not qualify for the 50 percent risk weight. This approach is intended to avoid possible circumvention
of the capital requirements and capture the risks associated with the combined transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC, OCC, and the OTS generally assign the loan secured by the first lien to the 50 percent risk-weight category
and the loan secured by the second lien to the 100 percent risk-weight category.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The capital guidelines of OTS permit thrift institutions to include in capital certain pledged deposits and nonwithdrawable
accounts that meet the criteria of the OTS. Income Capital Certificates and Mutual Capital Certificates held by the
OTS may also be included in capital by thrift institutions. These instruments are not relevant to commercial banks,
and, therefore, they are not addressed in the three banking agencies' capital guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Mutual Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies assign all of a bank's holdings in a mutual fund to the risk category appropriate to the highest
risk asset that a particular mutual fund is permitted to hold under its operating rules. The purpose of this is to take
into account the maximum degree of risk to which a bank may be exposed when investing in a mutual fund in view of the fact
that the future composition and risk characteristics of the fund's holding cannot be known in advance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS applies a capital charge appropriate to the riskiest asset that a mutual fund is actually holding at a particular
time. In addition, the OTS guidelines also permit, on a case-by-case basis, investments in mutual funds to be allocated
on a pro rata basis in a manner consistent with the actual composition of the mutual fund.

Section Two
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differences In Accounting Standards Among Federal Banking and Thrift Supervisory Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the auspices of the FFIEC, the three banking agencies have developed uniform reporting standards for commercial
banks which are used in the preparation of the Call Report. The FDIC has also applied these uniform Call Report standards
to savings banks under its supervision. The income statement and balance sheet accounts presented in the Call Report
are used by the bank supervisory agencies for determining the capital adequacy of banks and for other regulatory,
supervisory, surveillance, analytical, and general statistical purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121 of FDICIA requires accounting principles applicable to financial reports (including the Call Report)
filed by federally insured depository institutions with a federal banking agency to be uniform and consistent with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, under Section 121, a federal banking agency 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 require institutions to use accounting principles ``no less stringent than GAAP'' when the agency determines that
a specific accounting standard under GAAP does not meet these new accounting objectives. The banking agencies believe
that GAAP generally satisfies the three accounting objectives included in FDICIA Section 121. The three accounting
objectives in FDICIA Section 121 mandate that accounting principles should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Result in financial statements and reports of condition that accurately reflect the institution's capital;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Facilitate effective supervision of depository institutions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Facilitate prompt corrective action at least cost to the insurance funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, Section 121 of FDICIA requires the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies to utilize
accounting principles for regulatory reports that are consistent with GAAP or are no less stringent than GAAP. The
reporting instructions for Call Reports that are required by the three banking agencies are substantially consistent,
aside from a few limited exceptions, with GAAP as applied by commercial banks. As a matter of policy, the regulatory
reporting instructions for Call Reports deviate from GAAP only in those instances where statutory requirements
or overriding supervisory concerns warrant a departure from GAAP. Furthermore, in those cases where accounting
principles applicable to bank Call Reports are different from GAAP, the regulatory accounting principles are intended
to be more conservative than GAAP. Thus, the accounting principles that are followed for regulatory reporting purposes
are consistent with the objectives and mandate of FDICIA Section 121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have been working to limit the number of differences between regulatory accounting principles and GAAP,
however, in some circumstances differences will exist when there is a need to address supervisory concerns. In addition,
the agencies have been working closely to coordinate any new accounting policies, to ensure consistency among the
agencies and to reduce or eliminate differences with GAAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS has developed and maintains a separate reporting system for the thrift institutions under its supervision.
The TFR is based on GAAP as applied by thrifts, which differs in some respects from GAAP for banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the primary differences in accounting principles by the federal banking and thrift agencies for regulatory
reporting purposes are set forth below, based on a study developed on an interagency basis:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Futures and forward contracts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The banking agencies, as a general rule, do not permit the deferral of gains or losses by banks on futures and forwards
whether or not they are used for hedging purposes. All changes in market value of futures and forward contracts are
reported in current period income. The banking agencies adopted this reporting standard as a supervisory policy
prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 80, which allows hedge or deferral accounting, under certain circumstances.
Contrary to this general rule, hedge accounting in accordance with FASB Statement No. 80 is permitted by the three
banking agencies only for futures and forward contracts used in mortgage banking operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS practice is to follow FASB Statement No. 80 for futures contracts. In accordance with this statement, when
hedging criteria are satisfied, the accounting for the futures contract is related to the accounting for the hedged
item. Changes in the market value of the futures contract are recognized in income when the effects of related changes
in the price or interest rate of the hedged item are recognized. Such reporting can result in deferred gains or losses
which would be reflected on the thrift's balance sheet in accordance with GAAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Excess servicing fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general rule, the three banking agencies do not follow GAAP for excess servicing fees, but require a more conservative
treatment. Excess servicing results when loans are sold with servicing retained and the stated servicing fee rate
is greater than the normal servicing fee rate. With the exception of sales of pools of first lien one-to-four family
residential mortgages for which the banking agencies' approach is consistent with FASB Statement No. 65, excess
servicing fee income in banks must be reported as realized over the life of the transferred asset, not recognized up
front as required by FASB Statement No. 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS allows the present value of the future excess servicing fee to be treated as an adjustment to the sales price
for purposes of recognizing gain or loss on the sale. This approach is consistent with FASB Statement No. 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
In-substance defeasance of debt
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The banking agencies do not permit banks to report defeasance of their debt obligations in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 76. Defeasance involves a debtor irrevocably placing risk-free monetary assets in a trust solely for satisfying
the debt. Under FASB Statement No. 76, the assets in the trust and the defeased debt are removed from the balance sheet
and a gain or loss for the current period can be recognized. However, for Call Report purposes, banks may not remove
assets or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
defeased
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 liabilities from their balance sheets or recognize resulting gains or losses. The banking agencies have not adopted
FASB Statement No. 76 because of uncertainty regarding the irrevocable trusts established for defeasance purposes.
Furthermore, defeasance would not relieve the bank of its contractual obligation to pay depositors or other creditors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTS practice is to follow FASB Statement No. 76. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Sales of assets with recourse
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with FASB Statement No. 77, a transfer of receivables with recourse is recognized as a sale if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The transferor surrenders control of the future economic benefits,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transferor's obligation under the recourse provisions can be reasonably estimated, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The transferee cannot require repurchase of the receivables except pursuant to the recourse provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practice of the three banking agencies is generally to permit commercial banks to report transfers of receivables
with recourse as sales only when the transferring institution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Retains no risk of loss from the assets transferred and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has no obligation for the payment of principal or interest on the assets transferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result, virtually no transfers of assets with recourse can be reported as sales. However, this rule does not apply
to the transfer of first lien 1- to 4-family residential or agricultural mortgage loans under certain government-sponsored
programs (including the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation).
Transfers of mortgages under these programs are generally treated as sales for Call Report purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, private transfers of first lien 1- to four- family residential mortgages are also reported as sales
if the transferring institution retains only an insignificant risk of loss on the assets transferred. However, the
seller's obligation under recourse provisions related to sales of mortgage loans under the government programs
is viewed as an off-balance sheet exposure. Thus, for risk-based capital purposes, capital is generally expected
to be held for recourse obligations associated with such transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS policy is to follow FASB Statement No. 77. However, in the calculation of risk-based capital under the OTS guidelines,
off-balance sheet recourse obligations generally are converted at 100 percent. This effectively negates the sale
treatment recognized on a GAAP basis for risk-based capital purposes, but not for leverage capital purposes. Thus,
by making this adjustment in the risk-based capital calculation, the differences between the OTS and the banking
agencies for capital adequacy measurement purposes, are substantially reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FFIEC has a study under way involving the topic of transfers of assets with recourse (often referred to as the ``recourse
study''). As part of this study, the staff of the Federal Reserve is reviewing the reporting treatment for sales of
assets with recourse and is exploring with the staffs of the other agencies the possibility of reducing or eliminating
the differences between regulatory reporting requirements and GAAP in this area. A proposal addressing this issue
is being finalized for issuance for public comment in the near future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Push-Down Accounting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a depository institution is acquired in a purchase transaction, but retains its separate corporate existence,
the institution is required to revalue all of the assets and liabilities at fair value at the time of acquisition. When
push-down accounting is applied, the same revaluation made by the parent holding company is made at the depository
institution level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three banking agencies require push-down accounting when there is at least a 95 percent change in ownership. This
approach is generally consistent with interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS requires push-down accounting when there is at least a 90 percent change in ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Negative Goodwill
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies require that negative goodwill be reported as a liability, and not be netted against goodwill
assets. Such a policy ensures that all goodwill assets are deducted in regulatory capital calculations, consistent
with the Basle Accord.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS permits negative goodwill to offset goodwill assets reported in the financial statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three banking agencies are planning to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FIN 39) solely for on-balance sheet items
arising from off-balance sheet derivative instruments, when FIN 39 becomes effective in 1994. FIN 39 allows institutions
to offset assets and liabilities arising from traditional balance sheet items (e.g., loans, deposits, etc.) as well
as netting assets and liabilities arising from off-balance sheet derivative instruments only when four conditions
are met. The Call Report's existing guidance generally prohibits netting of assets and liabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS policy on netting of assets and liabilities is consistent with GAAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board staff intends to join the other agencies in a study of the possibility of adopting FIN 39 for traditional balance
sheet items in the next year.

Title: Entrant Information and Referral Form ORR&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB No.:

Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program is authorized under Title V of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, Public
Law 96&hyph;422. Section 501(a) of that Act directs the President to provide assistance and services to Cuban and
Haitian entrants to the same extent as those available to refugees under title IV of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (hereafter referred to as the ``Act''). An entrant differs from a refugee in the manner of his or her entry into the
U.S. Refugees are identified as such by overseas consular officials who arrange for their transportation to the U.S.
and for reception and placement services at the community of resettlement. An extensive case file is compiled by the
consular official and precedes the refugee to his final destination where he is met by a representative of a national
voluntary refugee resettlement agency (volging). The volging schedules case management and social services as
needed for the refugee. Each step in the refugee resettlement process is documented and data are collected and maintained
on the refugee by the Department of State's Refugee Data Center (RDC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The entrant usually arrives without prior contact with U.S. officials and therefore without documentation. The
entrant's first contact with the U.S. government is with an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) who determines the entrant's immigration status and whether the entrant is to be detained or released. If the
entrant is found eligible to remain in the U.S., reception and placement services are arranged through the Community
Relations Service (CRS) of the Department of Justice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because advance preparation is not possible for entrants, ORR and other Federal agencies have maintained an office
in the Miami area to provide information and referral services for the influx of Cubans and Haitian entrants who have
been arriving in the U.S. since 1959. ORR and the Community Relations Service (CRS) of the Department of Justice which
maintains strong ties to the local Cuban and Haitian communities coordinate employment and referral services with
community groups, local providers, immigration authorities, volgags, State agencies, hospitals, schools and
Federal social services agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Miami office maintains a data base on entrants from which data is made available to the State Department, INS, Department
of Justice, and the Department of Health and Human Services for statistical and management purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces that applications are being accepted for Injury Prevention
Research Grants for Violence Against Women. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health
promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity,
mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the area of Violent and Abusive Behavior.
(For ordering a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the Section Where To Obtain Additional Information.)

Eligible Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible applicants include all non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thus state, tribal, and local health
departments and other state, tribal, and local governmental agencies, universities, colleges, research institutions,
and other public and private organizations, including small, minority and/or woman-owned businesses are eligible
for these research grants. Current holders of CDC injury control research projects are eligible to apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $2.0 million is projected to be available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 5 to 9 grants. The amount of
funding actually available may vary and is subject to change. New grant awards will not exceed $300,000 per year (including
both direct and indirect costs). Research grant supplements will generally be no more than $75,000 (including both
direct and indirect costs). Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period not to exceed 3
years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress demonstrated
by investigators at work-in-progress monitoring workshops, the achievement of workplan milestones reflected
in the continuation application, and the availability of Federal funds. In addition, continuation awards will be
eligible for increased funding to offset inflationary costs depending upon the availability of funds.

Programmatic Interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grants should concentrate on the need to prevent the morbidity, mortality, and disability which result from violence
against women, in order to reduce the devastating social and economic impact on the nation. Applicants are encouraged
to propose research which either: (1) Rigorously evaluates the outcomes of violence prevention strategies currently
in use, or (2) identifies modifiable risk factors which can lead to the development of effective interventions. Examples
of possible projects listed under the priority areas below are by no means exhaustive, and innovative approaches
are encouraged. Because of time constraints, comments were not solicited from the general public regarding funding
priorities and special considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In prevention, there is specific interest in research that evaluates the effectiveness of interventions to prevent
injuries and deaths due to violence against women, or reduce their impact. There is also interest in research that
develops the basic sciences of injury control (i.e., social and behavioral sciences, and epidemiology). This research
might evaluate one or more different approaches to implementing a specific intervention strategy. In addition,
there is a need to examine intervention strategies for which evidence of effectiveness is either sparse or totally
lacking. Interventions chosen for evaluation should have a significant potential for reducing morbidity, mortality,
disability, or cost. Special consideration will be given to grants which target populations at high risk for violence-related
injuries and their consequences, including adolescents, children, racial and ethnic minorities, urban residents,
and people with low incomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of strategies for preventing violence against women which need to be rigorously evaluated for impact on
violent outcomes include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Establishing protocols for early identification and referral of abuse victims in health settings (e.g.,
Are women who are identified as being physically or sexually abused through victim identification and referral protocols
in hospital emergency departments, substance abuse and mental health centers, STD clinics, or prenatal care clinics
less likely than others to experience future abuse? Do home health visits reduce partner abuse in targeted families
and, as a consequence, reduce the likelihood that children will witness such violence?); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Batterer treatment programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Alcohol and drug abuse treatment services for batterers and victims in tandem with batterer treatment programs;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Public information and awareness campaigns to change attitudes and beliefs which perpetuate violence against
women (e.g., Can well-designed and administered public awareness campaigns change knowledge and attitudes that
perpetuate violence against women? Are hotlines that provide crisis intervention counseling an effective mechanism
for increasing the use of available services and programs?)

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks
of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions for violence against women. Examples of potentially
modifiable risk factors which should be examined for each area are listed below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Attitudes and beliefs which influence violent behavior against women (e.g., Are boys and men who hold attitudes
conducive to violence against women more likely to be violent towards women? What role does culture play in perpetuating
these attitudes?); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The impact of early childhood experiences of violence (either as a witness or victim of violence) upon the tendency
to develop violent behavior patterns in adulthood (e.g., What childhood experiences mitigate the harmful effects
on children of witnessing violent acts against women? What role does past exposure to varying forms of violence play
in repeated victimization?); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The role of alcohol and other drugs among batterers and their victims; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Factors in a dating relationship which precipitate violent behavior (e.g., Are young men who commit violent
acts against a date likely to continue these behaviors?); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Factors which precipitate battering during pregnancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also of programmatic interest is epidemiologic research having as its focus the development of improved methods
for and the evaluation of injury surveillance systems that accurately quantify the incidence and severity of injuries
that result from violence against women (e.g., emergency department-based surveillance of injuries due to violence
against women). Research is needed that more accurately defines the cost of violence against women, from a social,
physical, and psychological perspective (e.g., How does violence against women affect productivity in the workplace?
How does such violence affect the cost of health care in general?).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an intervention(s) that addresses
violence against women. A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in,
A Framework for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR&hyph;3, pages 5&hyph;11). (To receive information on these reports

Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon receipt, applications will be screened by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the
previous heading, Program Requirements (A&hyph;F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive
will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive
may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient
technical and scientific merit to warrant further review; the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications
judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing
for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review
process. The primary review will be a peer evaluation by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC) of the
scientific and technical merit of the application. The final review will be conducted by the CDC Advisory Committee
for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC), which will consider the results of the peer review together with program
need and relevance. Funding decisions will be made by the Director, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control
(NCIPC), based on merit and priority score ranking by the IRGRC, program review by the ACIPC, and the availability
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of Ethylene Glycol, a major constituent of motor vehicle antifreeze-coolant fluids and
also in other commercial products including hydraulic brake fluids, adhesives, printer's inks, and wood stains.
It is also used in the manufacturer of polyester films and fibers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) solid state resins,
plasticizers, elastomers, cellophane, and other products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering ethylene glycol in the diet of 60
male mice (0, 6,200, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm) and 60 female mice (0, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm) for up to 103 weeks.
These concentrations correspond to daily doses of approximately 1,500, 3,000, or 6,000 mg/kg body weight for male
mice and 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 mg/kg for females.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of ethylene glycol in male B6C3F1 mice receiving 6,250, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm, or in female B6C3F1 mice receiving 12,500,
25,000, or 50,000 ppm. Administration of ethylene glycol resulted in hepatocellular hyaline degeneration in male
mice fed diets containing 12,500 or 25,000 ppm and in female mice fed diets containing 50,000 ppm. An increased incidence
of medial hyperplasia of small pulmonary arteries and arterioles occurred in female mice fed diets containing 12,500,
25,000, or 50,000 ppm ethylene glycol.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of Mercuric Chloride, an inorganic compound that has been used in agriculture as a fungicide,
in medicine as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant, and in chemistry as an intermediate in the production of other
mercury compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two-year toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering to groups of 60 rats of each sex
0, 2.5, or 5 mg mercuric chloride/kg body weight and to groups of 60 mice of each sex 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg in deionized water
by gavage 5 days per week for 2 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of mercuric chloride in male F344 rats based on the increased incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach.
Marginally increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas may have been related to mercuric
chloride exposure. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of mercuric chloride in female F344 rats
based on two squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity
of mercuric chloride in male B6C3F1 mice based on the occurrences of two renal tubule adenomas and one renal tubule
adenocarcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of mercuric chloride in female B6C3F1 mice receiving
5 or 10 mg/kg.

intrascapular skin of groups of 60 Swiss-Webster mice of each sex. Doses of 0, 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg p-Nitrophenol were
administered to mice 3 days per week for 78 weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the conditions of these 18-month dermal studies there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity

The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: Two categories for
positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal
evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be
evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study'').

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that portions of the Public Lands along the Gila River below Coolidge Dam in Gila County, Arizona
will be closed to all forms of boating and rafting. The Gila River in this area is jointly administered by the Bureau
and the San Carlos Indian Reservation. This closure will not apply to emergency response agencies conducting official
business. This use restriction covers the Gila River as it crosses Public Lands from T. 3 S., R. 18 E., Section 17, downstream
to the confluence of Mescal Creek and the Gila River in T. 3 S., R. 17 E., Section 29, G &amp; SR Meridian, Arizona.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this use restriction is to provide protection for nesting bald eagles 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In past years, the Gila River was not navigable in this area due to water hazards. Recent flooding has opened up the river
channel and facilitated a proliferation of rafting and boating in the area. The bald eagle nest is low to the ground
and immediately adjacent to the river channel making it susceptible to human disturbance. To comply with the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended, the Bureau must not allow actions that may result in ``take'' of an endangered species
without being permitted according to Section 7 of the Act. Failure by the Bureau to control public access to this area
may result in disturbance to the nesting bald eagles and a violation of the Act. The Bureau will consult with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service when a permit system is established jointly with the San Carlos Indian Reservation.

and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal into the United States, pursuant to the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (58 FR 59061
and 58 FR 59063). The petitions were found to present sufficient information indicating that imposing a moratorium
on the imports of wild birds from Indonesia and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal may be warranted under the Act. The Service
received requests in writing from the following to extend the comment period: Government of Indonesia, Government
of S&eacute;n&eacute;gal, Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, and American Federation of Aviculture. In particular,
the Governments of Indonesia and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal requested additional time to fully review the petitions
and prepare a response. Those written requests were received by the Service during the period of December 23&hyph;27,
1993. The Service considers these requests warranted, and through the issuance of this notice, extends the comment
period on both of these petitions an additional 90 days, in order to receive as complete information as is possible
concerning the status of wild bird species in both Indonesia and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal.

 The Commission exempts from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10903&hyph;04 the Southern Pacific Transportation

Branch at milepost 220.9 at or near the Pinedale rail station. Under 49 U.S.C. 10907(b)(1) the Commission has no jurisdiction
over that action, because the segment is a spur track.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Participating agencies: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The participating agencies in this computer matching program are the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,
Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration (SSA).
This Notice is published as required by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as amended. A new
written agreement for this long-standing computer matching program recently has been approved by both the Department
of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services Data Integrity Boards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of match: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOL will conduct a computer matching program of DOL and SSA records of Black Lung benefit recipients in order to detect
individuals who might improperly receive dual Black Lung benefits from SSA and DOL. When a verified match occurs,
the case will be referred to the proper DOL office for development to assure the validity of the match and to make any
required benefit adjustments. The SSA data will contain the date of death of SSA beneficiaries. This information
will help to minimize those cases in which benefit payments are made to deceased beneficiaries, by identifying a DOL
beneficiary who has died, but DOL has not been notified of the death. The SSA data also will assist DOL in properly referring
inquiries and correspondence received at DOL regarding SSA-only Black Lung beneficiaries.

New Warwick Mining Company, R.D. 1, Box 167A, Mount Morris, Pennsylvania 15349 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1) (weekly examination) to its Warwick Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;02374) located in Greene County,
Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous roof conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner
proposes to establish evaluations points to monitor for methane and the quantity of air in the affected areas. The
petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would
the mandatory standard.

Costain Coal, Inc., P.O. Box 289, Sturgis, Kentucky 42459&hyph;0289 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364(b) (weekly examination) to its Baker Mine (I.D. No. 15&hyph;14492) located in Webster County, Kentucky.
The petitioner requests that the minimum volume of air reaching the inby monitoring point be 5,000 cubic feet per minute.
In addition, the petitioner proposes to physically examine the affected areas weekly rather than daily because the
mine wide atmospheric monitoring system, with a proposed additional sensor to measure air velocity, would provide
the necessary monitoring. This petition modifies a Decision and Order on a previous petition, docket number M&hyph;92&hyph;94&hyph;C.
The petitioner states that the proposed alternate method would not result in a diminution of safety to the miners.

to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.343(b) (underground shops) to its Loveridge No. 22 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01433)
located in Marion County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to ventilate the underground motor barn with intake
air that is coursed through the affected air course directly into a return air course and that is not used to ventilate
working places; and to establish check points to monitor for methane and the quantity of air in the affected area on
a weekly basis. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard.

the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its McElroy Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01437) located
in Marshall County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof conditions, certain areas of the return air course cannot
be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation points at specific locations and to have a certified

Sonora Mining Corporation, P.O. Box 1418, Jamestown, California 95327 has filed a petition to modify the application

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 30 CFR 56.9300 (berms or guardrails) to its Jamestown Mine (I.D. No. 04&hyph;04695) located in Tuolumne County,
California. The petitioner proposes to eliminate the use of berms during construction of the final lift on the tailings
dam and place material on the dam in one-foot compact layers in order to comply with the California State Division of
Dam Safety. The petitioner states that the height of the dam (200
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;) has reached a point where the width on top will not allow enough room for scrapers to travel and dump their loads
if berms are used. In addition, the petitioner states that to maintain a safe work environment, mobile equipment that
would work on top would drive forward only.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an one-time exemption from the
requirements of section III.A.5(b)(2) of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 issued to the Carolina Power &amp; Light Company
(the licensee), for the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP), Unit 1 and 2, located in Brunswick County, North Carolina.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would grant a one-time partial exemption from the schedular requirement in section III.A.5(b)(2)
of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, which requires a Type A test to be performed at each plant shutdown for refueling until
two consecutive Type A tests meet the acceptance criteria in section III.A.5(b). This exemption would allow the licensee
to return the BSEP to a normal testing frequency. Presently, both BSEP units are in the accelerated testing condition
of section III.A.5(b)(2) due to the as-found testing failures which were within L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
leakage limits but exceeded the 0.75 L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limit. For Type A (containment integrate leak rate) tests conducted at peak pressure, the measured leakage rate,
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
am
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, must be less than 75 percent of the maximum allowable leakage rate, L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, measured at the calculated peak containment internal pressure, P
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These terms are defined in section II of appendix J. In accordance with section III.A.6(b) of appendix J, if subsequently
two consecutive Type A tests for a unit should fail to meet the acceptance criterion, the accelerated test frequency
will be resumed. The next Unit 1 Type A test will be conducted during the Reload 9 outage, scheduled for March 1995, and
the next Unit 2 Type A test will be conducted during the Reload 12 outage, scheduled for March 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12, Specific Exemptions, and is based upon the information provided
to the Commission in the licensee's request for exemption dated October 19, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption is needed to avoid outage extensions and the increased outage costs while the tests for the
accelerated Type A containment leakage rate are being conducted. Granting of the exemption would return both BSEP
units to a normal test frequency. The exemption would also minimize subjecting the drywell to additional structural
stresses during the Type A tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's staff has determined that (a) the granting of the proposed exemption would not significantly increase
the probability or amount of expected containment leakage and (b) the integrity of the containment would be maintained.
Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased, nor would the post-accident radiological releases
be greater than previously determined. The proposed exemption would not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents.
Therefore, the Commission's staff concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves a change to surveillance testing
schedular requirements. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated
with the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed
action, any alternatives would have either no or greater environmental impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts
attributed to this facility but could result in an increased frequency for Type A tests. This would result in the expenditure
of resources without any compensating benefit.

Alternative Use of Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated January 1974. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Agencies and Persons Consulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;40, issued to Omaha Public Power District (OPPD/the licensee), for operation of Fort Calhoun
Station, Unit No. 1, located in Washington County, Nebraska.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would consist of revisions to 10 CFR part 20 references to recognize the new section numbers,
revise definitions to ensure consistency with 10 CFR part 20, and change administrative controls for reporting and
recordkeeping to maintain compliance with the new part 20. The changes would revise the limitations on concentrations
of radioactive material released in liquid effluents and the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive
material released in gaseous effluents and reflect the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 10.106 requirements to the new
10 CFR 20.1302. These changes are in response to the licensee's application for amendment dated May 21, 1993, as supplemented
September 10, 1993, implementing the new 10 CFR part 20.

The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, appendix
I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision, in regards to the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TSs)
as a dose rate to the maximally exposed member of the public, will not increase the types or amounts of effluents that
may be released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the
Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed
amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed
amendment to the TSs, any alternative to the amendment will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or will have greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment.
This would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
(FES) related to the operation of the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1, dated August 1972.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed license amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating
to the Maintenance by Members of Certain Written Policies and Procedures</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 20, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership and who performs no other
function in respect of the membership is not subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment,
maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting misuse of non-public information.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of the basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposal is to amend Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership and who performs
no other function in respect of the membership is not subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment,
maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting misuse of non-public information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its current form, Rule 4.18 requires all members to maintain and enforce written policies and procedures concerning
non-public information. Lessor members who have no other activities, however, do not conduct any securities business
in respect of their membership, and, according to the Exchange, are not required to register as broker-dealers under
section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under these circumstances, the Exchange believes there is no reason
to subject these members to the written policy and procedure requirements of Rule 4.18, which by their terms are meaningful
only to an ongoing securities business. Accordingly, Rule 4.18 is proposed to be amended to clarify that members who
perform no function in respect of their membership except as lessors do not have to establish, maintain or enforce
written policies and procedures precluding misuse of non-public information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect the public interest by eliminating unnecessary costs and burdens without impairing CBOE's
capacity to meet the requirements of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the
Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to that which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Solicitation of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;58

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I
and II below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE proposes to designate in its rules the entities that report to the Exchange the current values and the exercise
settlement values of the interest rate measures underlying the interest rate options listed for trading on the Exchange.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposal is to specify the entities that the CBOE has designated to report the current values and
the closing exercise settlement values of interest rate measures underlying CBOE's interest rate options. The CBOE
believes that the proposed amendment also conforms the procedures currently employed for determining current values
and closing exercise settlement values of its short-term interest rate options (``IRX'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 with those procedures recently approved by the Commission for the listing and trading on the Exchange of options based
on the yields of specified U.S. Treasury notes and bonds (``Long-Term Measures'').

The Exchange also currently lists and trades a long-term interest rate option which is based on composite yields of
the most recently auctioned seven- and ten-year treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds (``LTX''). The Exchange
has represented, however, that since the Treasury plans to cease issuing seven-year notes, the Exchange will not
issue any new series of LTX contracts.

As amended, new Interpretation .01 to Rule 23.1 lists Telerate Inc. as the designated reporting authority of current
values used for intra-day options pricing purposes and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY'') as the designated
reporting authority of spot yields used for calculating the exercise settlement values of interest rate options.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission recently approved those designations in connection with the listing and trading of Long-Term Measures.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal makes those designations applicable to all interest rate options traded on the Exchange.

The spot yield is determined each business day by reference to the price and interest rate of the underlying Treasury
security. Customarily, each time the Treasury issues a new note or bond, the new note or bond will become the reference
instrument within its issue type. Substitution of the new issue as the reference instrument takes effect on the day
following the Treasury's new issue auction. Occasionally, the most recently auctioned issue will not be the longest
maturity, and in that circumstance, no substitution will occur.

In addition, the proposed amendment to Rule 23.1 specifies that the Exchange will use a backup polling procedure to
establish applicable underlying values for exercise settlement purposes on those occasions on the last trading
day prior to expiration of the interest rate option contracts that the FRBNY does not generate the required spot yields.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 This polling procedure will be uniform for all interest rate options traded on the Exchange.

Under this polling procedure, the CBOE's computer will randomly draw the names of ten primary government bond dealers
from a list of 16 dealers. Each of the ten dealers will be asked to provide a bid and ask quotation for each relevant Treasury
security. A series of checks will be conducted on each set of quotes to ensure the integrity of the process. If a quote
is rejected, another dealer will be randomly selected from CBOE's list of government bond dealers to provide the necessary
quotations. Once ten acceptable quotes have been obtained, the midpoint of each bid-ask quotation is determined
and the midpoints are then averaged to compute the closing yield for the issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to enhance cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities,
and to protect investors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.

or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=3 -->
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds, as it did in approving these same pricing procedures for the Long-Term Measures,
that the CBOE proposal has been adequately designed to guard against unreliable or manipulated quotas.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE has been obtaining quotes from Telerate for intra-day pricing of its interest rate options without generating
any concern with respect to unreliable or manipulated quotes. In this regard, the proposal merely codifies the Exchange's
intra-day pricing procedures currently in effect and which have previously been approved by the SEC for use with all
of the Exchange's interest rate options.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the CBOE's reliance on FRBNY spot yield quotes and the backup polling procedure when those quotes are
unavailable, the Commission finds as it did in approving the Long-Term Measures, that these procedures are more reliable
than the polling procedures currently employed for purposes of determining closing settlement values for the IRX
and the LTX option contracts.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Commission believes it is appropriate to codify these procedures, making them applicable to all of
the Exchange's interest rate options.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to permit the Exchange to begin implementing these procedures with respect to the IRX contracts as soon as
possible in order to minimize any investor confusion that could arise from having varying procedures for determining
closing settlement values for different interest rate option contracts. Additionally, the Commission notes that
no comments were received prior to approval when these procedures were published for comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with respect to the Long-Term Measures. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 6(b)(5)
and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

IV. Solicitation of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE proposes to trade options on the Nasdaq Index, a stock index calculated and maintained by the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. (``Nasdaq''), a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). The
CBOE also proposes to list long-term options (``LEAPS'') on the Index. Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in
addition to regular Index options traded on the Exchange.

The Index will be maintained by Nasdaq. Nasdaq has notified the CBOE that it recently updated the list of securities
comprising the Index and will continue to make revisions to the Index on an annual basis. Nasdaq also, in its discretion,
will make special adjustments to the securities comprising the Index to reflect such events as stock splits or reverse
splits, spinoffs, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and similar events, upon their occurrence.

The numerical value of the Index was established at 250 prior to the opening of the market on February 1, 1985. At the
close of the market on December 31, 1993, the Index was at 796.56. Then, effective January 3, 1994, the Index value was
halved, creating an Index level of 398.28 at the market opening on January 3, 1994. The Index is calculated and disseminated
every fifteen seconds to market information vendors. Nasdaq will also calculate the exercise settlement value for
each expiring series of Nasdaq Index options and make this value available to the CBOE for use by the Options Clearing
Corporation in effecting settlement of exercises and assignments of the options.

The Index value, for purposes of setting outstanding Index options contracts upon expiration, will be calculated
based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component stocks on the last trading day prior
to expiration.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of the Index will be determined and that value will be used as
the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts. If any of the component stocks do not open for trading
on the last trading day before expiration, then the last reported sale price of such security will be used in any case
where that security does not trade on that day.

Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) will expire on the Saturday following the third
Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). Since options on the Index will settle based upon the opening
prices of the component stocks on the last trading day before expiration (normally a Friday), the last trading day
for an expiring Index option series will normally be the second to the last business day before expiration (normally

F. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value Nasdaq Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange may list LEAPS that expire 12 to 36 months from date of issuance on the full-value Nasdaq Index or a reduced-value
Nasdaq Index that will be computed on one-tenth the value of the full-value Index.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The current and closing Index value for reduced-value Nasdaq LEAPS will be computed by dividing the value of the full-value
Index by 10 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, a Index value of 185.46 would
be 18.55 for the Index LEAPS and 185.43 would become 18.54. The reduced-value LEAPS will have a European-style exercise
and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all the Exchange's index options, including sales practice
rules, margin requirements and floor trading procedures. The strike price interval for the reduced-value Index
LEAPS will be no less than $2.50 instead of $5.00.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The same Exchange rules which are applicable to the trading of full-value LEAPS will be applicable to the trading of
reduced-value Index LEAPS. For example, both full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS may expire from 12 to 36 months
from the date of issuance, and there may be up to six expiration months beyond one year to expiration. Moreover, either
full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS may be issued at six month intervals and new strike prices will either be near
or bracketing the current Index value. Strike price interval, bid/ask differential, and continuity rules will not
apply to the trading of the full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS until their time to expiration is less than 12 months.
The strike price interval for reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50, instead of $5.00 for full-value
Index LEAPS. Lastly, additional LEAPS series may be added when the value of the underlying Index increases or decreases
by ten to fifteen percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Position limits for the Index options Index LEAPS will be set at no more than 25,000 contracts on the same side of the
market, provided that no more than 15,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Exercise limits will be set at the same level as position limits.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 CBOE hedge exemption provisions will apply to Index options and Index LEAPS.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Also, for purposes of determining whether a given position in reduced-value Index options complies with applicable
position and exercise limits, positions in reduced-value Index options will be aggregated with positions in the
full-value Index options. For these purposes, ten reduced-value contracts will equal one full-value contract for
purposes of aggregating these positions.

The Commission has reviewed the proposal to list and trade Nasdaq Index options and Index LEAPS. As discussed below,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. In particular, the Index is broad-based,
the proposed options are designed to reduce the potential for manipulation, and the proposal to list and trade Nasdaq
Index options and Index LEAPS is consistent with the CBOE's obligation to promote investor protection.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission finds that the trading of options on the Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS,
will permit investors to participate in the price movements of the 100 securities on which the Index is based. Further,
trading of options on the Index will allow investors holding positions in some or all of the securities underlying
the Index to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. Accordingly, the Commission, believes the Nasdaq
Index options will provide investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that should reflect accurately
the overall movement of 100 of the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq National Market. By broadening
the hedging and investment opportunities of investors, the Commission believes that the trading of Nasdaq Index
options will serve to protect investors, promote the public interest, and contribute to the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets.

The CBOE is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other
things, coordinate more effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock
and options markets. See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the
ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members
on January 29, 1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The
Commission understands that the ISG Agreement, as amended, covers investigations and inquiries regarding trading
activity in Nasdaq Index options and component securities.

Pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option or warrant proposal
upon a finding that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would
be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits
that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished
public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading
of listed options on the Nasdaq Index will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should reflect the overall
movement of 100 of the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq National Market. The Commission also believes
that these options will provide investors with a means by which to make investment decisions in the utilities equity
market, allowing them to establish positions or increase existing positions in utilities stocks in a cost effective
manner.

The trading of options on the Nasdaq Index, including the trading of full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, however,
raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market
impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE has addressed these concerns adequately.

A. Index Design and Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the Nasdaq Index and reduced-value Nasdaq Index are broad-based indices, and thus it is
appropriate to permit Exchange rules applicable to the trading of broad-based index options to apply to the Index
options, including Index LEAPS. Specifically, the Commission believes the Index is broad-based because it reflects
a substantial segment of the U.S. equities market. In addition, the basic character of the reduced-value Nasdaq Index,
which is comprised of the same component securities as the Nasdaq Index and calculated by dividing the Nasdaq Index
by ten, is essentially identical to the Nasdaq Index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component stocks significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the Index represents
and consists of the common stock values of 100 actively traded U.S. companies. Second, no one particular stock or group
of stocks dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock comprises more than 10.54% of the Index's total value and
the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounts for 33.27% of the Index's value. Third, the
overwhelming majority of the stocks that comprise the Index are actively traded, with a mean and median average daily
trading volume of 631,631 and 407,639 shares, respectively. Fourth, the market capitalizations of the stocks in
the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $26.8 billion to a low of $437 million as of October 25, 1993, with the
mean and median being $2.54 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Fifth, the Index is comprised of stocks representing
a diverse group of industries, the most heavily represented by Index weight including computer software products
and service, semiconductors, telephone equipment and service, broadcasting, and retail. Sixth, 97 out of the 100
component stocks in the Index, comprising 98.82% of the weighting of the Index, currently are eligible for options
trading.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the Commission believes that, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those
securities will help deter as well as detect illegal trading activity involving the index option.

The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying
an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) The public float must be at least 7,000,000;
(2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 stockholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million over the preceding
twelve months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days during the preceding
three calendar months.

B. Customer Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Nasdaq Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded
options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) The special risks of options
are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading
are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly,
because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options
currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection
of investors in Nasdaq Index options and Nasdaq Index LEAPS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission generally believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a
stock index derivative and the exchange(s) trading the stocks underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
stock index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the NASD, which currently is the primary market for all of the Index's component securities, is a member
of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance
information.

D. Market Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of Nasdaq Index options, including full-value and
reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 First, as described above, the Index is broad-based and comprised of 100 stocks with no one stock dominating the Index.
Second, as noted above, the stocks contained in the Index have relatively large capitalizations and are relatively
actively traded. Third, the 25,000 contract position and exercise limits will serve to minimize potential manipulation
and market impact concerns. Fourth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because
the Index options will be issued and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation just like any other standardized
option traded in the United States. Fifth, existing CBOE stock index options rules and surveillance procedures will
apply to Nasdaq Index options.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') have the
necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of
Index options and Index LEAPS. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 letter from Charles J. Henry, President and Chief Operating Officer, CBOE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director,
Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated January 4, 1993 and memorandum from Joe Corrigan, Executive Director,
OPRA, to Eileen Smith, CBOE, dated January 4, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring Nasdaq Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is reasonable and consistent with the Act. As noted
in other contexts, valuing expiring index options for exercise settlement purposes based on opening prices rather
than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on the securities underlying options on the Index.

II. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, GSCC's general disciplinary rule
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 authorizes GSCC to discipline members for violations of GSCC's rules and other actions that constitute an abuse or
misuse of GSCC's processes and services or otherwise reflect ``conduct detrimental to GSCC's operations.'' The
proposed rule change amends the general disciplinary rule to provide language specific to GSCC's current operations
and to allow it to fulfill better its responsibilities as a self-regulatory organization.

GSCC Rule 48, Section 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under GSCC's proposal, the Membership and Standards Committee (of GSCC's Board of Directors (``Board'')) (``Committee'')
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 classifies rules violations or incidents of detrimental conduct as either major or minor offenses. Major offenses
generally involve either misconduct involving the funds or securities obligations of a member or deliberate acts
of fraud or misconduct by a member. Repeated offenses of a minor nature by a member, however, may cause the member to
be deemed to have committed a major offense. A member committing a major offense is subject to disciplinary action,
including termination of its membership in either or both the comparison and netting systems, having GSCC cease to
act for it, the imposition of a higher minimum Clearing Fund requirement, and/or a fine of up to $5,000.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Disciplinary actions involving ceasing to act for or termination of membership in the comparison or netting system
require Board approval.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee, which meets monthly (as necessary), acts as a disciplinary committee to address violations of the
disciplinary rule. Management is responsible for presenting to the Committee rules violations and actions that,
in Management's opinion, constitute detrimental conduct for the Committee's determination as to what, if any, disciplinary
action is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The maximum fine amount of $5,000 is defined so as to exclude any amounts sought by GSCC to directly recompense it for
costs and expenses incurred as the result of a member's misconduct. All fines must be paid within 90 days from notice
of imposition of the fine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the Committee has determined that a member committed a major offense, a letter automatically is sent to senior
management of the offending member requiring that the member explain to GSCC in writing why the offense occurred and
the actions taken and/or to be taken to ensure that it will not reoccur. If appropriate under the circumstances, representatives
of senior management of the member may be required to appear in person before the Committee to provide such explanation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A member committing a minor offense is subject to a fine or other disciplinary action, not to include GSCC ceasing to
act for it or termination of membership. While a minor offense may not result in the imposition of a fine or other disciplinary
action, for each such offense, GSCC automatically will send a letter to the management of the member that commits the
offense informing it of its commission of the offense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Committee (with the Board's approval in certain cases) determines that any type of disciplinary action should
be taken against a member, GSCC is obligated to notify the member of such determination. In this notification, GSCC
will state the reasons for the disciplinary action and will inform the member of its right to a hearing to contest the
action. After receiving this notice, a member has ten business days to file a written request for a hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hearings on disciplinary actions that, under GSCC's rules, require approval by the Board,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 are before a panel of five directors selected by the Board. Hearings on all other disciplinary actions are before a
panel of three Committee members selected by the Committee. Both panels must be composed of a majority of directors
who are not also GSCC officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The imposition of any disciplinary action involving ceasing to act or termination of membership in either or both
the comparison system or the netting system requires Board approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A member is able to appear before the panel in person (with its counsel, if it so chooses) to contest the planned disciplinary
action. Alternatively, in lieu of a personal appearance, the member can submit to the panel documentary evidence
in support of its claim that the planned disciplinary action is inappropriate. GSCC will inform the member of the panel's
determination, as well as the member's right to appeal further to the full Board. If the panel's decision is adverse
to the member, the sanction is effective immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board will be presented with the record of any panel hearing at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Its determination
ordinarily will be made based upon a review of that record. A member does not have the right to appear in person before
the Board to contest the determination of the panel; however, the Board may permit such a personal appearance in its
discretion. Any appeal of the Board decision will have to be made to the Commission.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 requires a clearing agency to be organized so as to enable it to enforce compliance by its participants with its rules.
Section 17A(b)(3)(G) and section 17A(b)(3)(H) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 require the rules of a clearing agency to provide that is participants shall be appropriately disciplined for violations
of any provision of those rules and to provide fair procedures, consistent with section 17A(b)(5) of the Act, for disciplining
participants.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Section 17A(b)(5) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 outlines the procedures to be followed by a clearing agency in disciplining participants. A clearing agency must
bring specific charges, notify the participant of the charges, provide the participant with an opportunity to defend
against such charges, and keep a record. GSCC's proposal is consistent with the Act, and section 17A in particular,
because it provides fair, efficient procedures for disciplining participants and enforcing its decisions as required
by that section.

GSCC has specific rules governing the circumstances pursuant to which it may take certain disciplinary actions against
a member, such as increasing a member's margin requirements, ceasing to act for a member, terminating a member's membership
in either or both the comparison and netting systems, and/or liquidating a member's positions. Pursuant to recent
changes in membership standards, GSCC also has rules governing the specific consequences of a failure of a member
to maintain an applicable membership standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By providing a more formal process, the proposed rule change allows GSCC to more effectively discipline its members.
Prior to imposing a sanction, members will be informed of the Committee's determination that a major or minor offense
has occurred. This procedure may prevent future violations by providing members with early notice of a violation.
In the case of a major offense, members must provide GSCC with a written explanation. This explanation may give GSCC
guidance in determining the appropriate sanction to be imposed. The members are, in turn, permitted a greater opportunity
to participate in the internal disciplinary process. By allowing the members to provide input, GSCC may be able to
resolve disputes prior to an appeal to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that GSCC's proposal will enable it to discipline its members for rule violations, consistent
with sections 17A(b)(3)(A) and 17A(b)(3)(G) of the Act. The Commission also believes that GSCC's proposed procedures
are consistent with the fair disciplinary procedures requirement of section 17A(b)(3)(H), and with the mandatory
procedures enumerated in section 17A(b)(5) of the Act. The proposal permits GSCC's Board to address rule violations
fairly and efficiently. Members will be provided with notice of any disciplinary action to be taken by the Committee
or the Board, including the reasons for the action. Members will be given two opportunities to have an internal hearing
on the proposed sanction_before a panel of the Committee or Board, and before the full Board.

IV. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the
Act, and particularly with section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;93&hyph;06)
be, and hereby is, approved.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 20, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange previously submitted this proposal on December 13, 1993, however, in response to Commission concerns,
the PSE delayed effectiveness of the rule change pending amendment and resubmission to the Commission in its current
form.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PSE is proposing to amend Commentary .04 to Rule 3.7 in order to make technical corrections involving cross-referencing.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PSE, and at the Commission.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the PSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has
prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 30, 1993, the Commission approved an Exchange proposal to add new Commentaries to PSE Rule 3.7.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange is now proposing to amend one of those, Commentary .04, by changing two internal cross-references and
adding the term ``this'' in two places. The exchange believes that the proposed changes are technical in nature and
are consistent with the Commission's order approving File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;91&hyph;19.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market.

Act and subparagraph (e)(1) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed

is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Fund, incorporated in 1981 under the laws of the state of Maryland, is an open-end, non-diversified management
investment company registered under the Act. The Fund's investment adviser is EQSF Advisers, Inc. (``EQSF''). The
Fund does not qualify to elect to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code, and thus pays taxes on its income in the same manner as a business corporation. As of October 31, 1993, approximately
92% of the Fund's assets consisted of the common stock of Nabors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Nabors, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1978, is principally engaged in the business of contract drilling
and other oilfield services. It has one class of stock, voting common stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange
(the ``AMEX''). As of October 31, 1993, approximately 18% of Nabors' stock was held by the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Martin J. Whitman is Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Fund. As of October 31, 1993, he owned
approximately 7.8% of the outstanding stock of the Fund. Mr. Whitman serves as a director of Nabors and has a financial
interest in Nabors other than through the Fund by virtue of his direct and indirect ownership interests in various
private partnerships that hold Nabors stock. (As of October 31, 1993, these partnerships owned in the aggregate approximately
3% of the outstanding stock of Nabors.) Mr. Whitman also controls 100% of the outstanding common stock of EQSF, the
Fund's investment adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants seek relief on behalf of themselves and any individuals (other than Mr. Whitman) who require relief
from section 17(a) and rule 17d&hyph;1 (collectively, ``Affected Persons''). ``Affected Persons'' are officers,
directors, or employees of Nabors, the Fund, and EQSF who own shares of the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the ``Reorganization Agreement''), the Fund proposes to
transfer to Nabors all of its assets, other than cash and cash equivalents equal to $1 million, but none of its liabilities.
The $1 million retained by the Fund shall be placed in a ``Reserve Fund'' for payment of any contingent liabilities
and obligations of the Fund. In exchange for the Fund's assets, Nabors will transfer to the Fund shares of Nabors stock,
as described more fully in the next paragraph. The exchange of Fund assets for Nabors stock will occur on the ``Closing
Date.'' As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Fund will liquidate and dsitribute pro rata to its stockholders
of record the shares of Nabors stock received by the Fund pursuant to the Reoganization Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Immediately prior to the reorganization, the Fund's assets will consist entirely of Nabors stock, cash, and cash
equivalents. For purposes of the reoganization, shares of Nabors stock will be valued at the average of the closing
prices of Nabors stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the ``Market Price of Nabors
Stock'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will be valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The number of shares of Nabors stock to be issued to the Fund in the reorganization will be determined by dividing the
aggregate value of the assets transferred from the Fund to Nabors by the Market Price of Nabors Stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Boards of the Fund and Nabors believe that using a five-day average, rather than a single day's price, would decrease
the possibility of manipulation of Nabors stock by third party market participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The Reserve Fund is designed to satisfy any currently unknown contingent liabilities that may become actual after
liquidation of the Fund. Potential contingent liabilities include the possibility that the IRS or a state tax authority
would assert that the Fund has made inadequate provision for taxes on past transactions, or that the Fund's net asset
value had been erroneously computed. Although the Fund currently is unaware of any such liabilities, the Reserve
Fund will be established to protect Fund officers and directors, who otherwise would be personally liable for such
liabilities. The Reserve Fund shall be administered by one or more of the Fund's disinterested directors. Any amounts
remaining in the Reserve Fund upon its termination (which, under applicable Maryland law shall occur no earlier than
three years from its inception) shall be distributed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to the Fund's stockholders of record as of the Closing Date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Fund will bear all of the expenses associated with the reorganization, except that Nabors will bear all legal
fees incurred by it related to the negotiation of the Reorganization Agreement. Applicants expect the total cost
of the Reorganization to range from $400,000 to $450,000, of which the Fund will pay all but approximately $100,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Reorganization Agreement has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund, including the disinterested
directors thereof, and by the Board of Directors of Nabors, including the nonmanagement directors thereof. (The
two boards have one common member, Mr. Whitman.) Consumation of the reorganization is subject to the Commission's
issuance of the order requested by applicants and to the approval of Fund stockholders. The Reorganization Agreement
will be submitted to the stockholders of the Fund for approval at a special meeting. Fund stockholders will receive
a proxy statement/prospectus containing information about Nabors and describing the proposed reorganization
and the reasons therefor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In approving the Reorganization Agreement, the Fund Board considered a number of factors. First, and most important,
the reorganization is tax-free. The Fund received an IRS ruling on May 20, 1993, to the effect that, for federal income
tax purposes, the reorganization will be tax-free to the Fund, the Fund's stockholders, and Nabors. Alternatives
to the reorganization, including a simple liquidation of the Fund, would result in a taxable event to both the Fund
and its stockholders. In this regard, applicants note that alternatives to the reorganization would require the
Fund to pay tax, estimated to be about $30.3 million (approximately 35% of the Fund's net asset value), on the capital
gains attributable to the appreciation of Nabors stock held by the Fund. In addition, the Fund Board considered that
(i) the reorganization will eliminate the management fee currently paid by Fund stockholders, because such individuals
will own Nabors stock directly, rather than indirectly through the Fund; (ii) Fund shareholders will receive readily
marketable securities, since Nabors stock is traded on the AMEX; and (iii) the costs to the Fund of engaging in the reorganization
will not be significant in relation to the benefits conferred.

11. Fund stockholders who oppose the reorganization may redeem their shares at any time before the Closing Date. Redeeming
stockholders, however, would forego the tax benefit of the reorganization because the elimination of the capital
gains tax associated with the Nabors stock will inure only to the benefit of Fund stockholders who receive liquidating
distributions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Because the Fund owns of record more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Nabors, Nabors is an ``affiliated person''
of the Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Because Mr. Whitman controls the Fund's investment adviser,
is a director of the Fund and Nabors, and holds a substantial indirect interest in Nabors, Mr. Whitman is an affiliated
person of the Fund and Nabors. The Affected Persons, by virtue of their official positions and/or employment relationships,
are affiliated persons of the Fund or affiliated persons of such persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(a)d of the Act, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of such an affiliated person, acting as principal, to purchase from or sell to such
registered company any security or other property. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a
proposed transaction from section 17(a) if: (i) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration
to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, and
(iii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For the reasons discussed above, the Fund Board and the Nabors Board found that the reorganization is in the best
interests of the Fund and Nabors, respectively, and will not dilute the interests of the existing stockholders of
either company. In addition, each Board determined that the terms of the proposed reorganization and the consideration
to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching by any person. Although the Fund has agreed
to pay most of the costs associated with the reorganization, applicants aver that the benefits to the Fund, in particular
the elimination of a $30 million deferred tax liability, substantially outweigh any such costs. Accordingly, applicants
submit that the proposed reorganization satisfies the standards of section 17(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1, taken together, prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company
or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in any joint enterprise or other joint
arrangement in which such registered company is a participant, without prior receipt of a Commission order. Under
rule 17d&hyph;1(b), the Commission will consider whether the participation of such registered company in such joint
enterprise or arrangement on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the
Act, and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other
participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. There are no employment contracts or other special benefits accorded to any affiliated person of the Fund or Nabors
under the Reorganization Agreement. Indeed, the reorganization could be considered detrimental to Mr. Whitman
and those Affected Persons who are employees of EQSF because it will eliminate the management fee currently payable
to EQSF by the Fund. Accordingly, applicants submit that the proposed reorganization satisfies the standards for
an order under rule 17d&hyph;1.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One are the ARAC deals with is air carrier/general aviation
maintenance issues. These issues involve mechanic certification and approved training schools outlined in parts
65 and 147 and the maintenance standards for parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 aircraft, engines, propellers, and
their component parts and parallel provisions in parts 21, 43, 91, 121, 125, 127, 129, 133, 135, and 137 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR), which are the responsibility of the FAA Director, Flight Standards Service.

Task
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, ARAC tasked the working group as follows: Review Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14_Aeronautics
and Space, Chapter I_Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, and supporting policy and
guidance material for the purpose of determining the course of action to be taken for rulemaking and/or policy relative
to the issue of acceptable and/or approved data. If ARAC determines rulemaking documents or advisory circulars are
appropriate to resolve the major/minor problem, such documents should be developed by ARAC, along with proper justifications
and any legal and economic analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The working group will develop and present to ARAC for consideration any combination of the following as it deems appropriate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A draft notice of proposed rulemaking proposing new requirements with regard to the issue of acceptable and/or
approved date with supporting economic and other required analysis, and any other collateral documents the working
group determines appropriate; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If new or revised requirements standards or compliance methods are not recommended, a draft report stating the
rationale for those recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The working group chair (or his designee) should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Recommend time line(s) for completion of the task, including rationale, for consideration at the meeting of the
ARAC to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues held following publication of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Give a status report on this task at each meeting of ARAC held to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Give a detailed conceptual presentation to ARAC of the working group's recommendations before proceeding with
drafting of documents described in paragraphs A and B above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs of Alterations Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations
having an interest in the task assigned. A working group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the
member organizations of the ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member
of the working group should write the person listed under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the working
group. The request will be reviewed with the Assistant Chair of the ARAC for air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues and the Chair of the Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group, and the individual
will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest
in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider air carrier/general
aviation maintenance issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act. Meetings of the Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group will not be open
to the public, except to the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the publication by NHTSA of a Technical Report concerning the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP).
The report examines the Correlation of NCAP Performance with Fatality Risk in Actual Head-On Collisions. In NCAP,
frontal crash tests of approximately 35 passenger vehicles are conducted each year and the test results are made available
to the public, in response to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972. The Department of Transportation
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 directed ``NHTSA to provide a study to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations comparing the results of New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) data from previous model
years to determine the validity of these tests in predicting actual on-the-road injuries and fatalities over the
lifetime of the models.'' In December 1993, NHTSA submitted a report to Congress, titled Response to the NCAP FY 1992
Congressional Requirements, summarizing the agency's analyses of head-on collisions and other types of crashes.
This Technical Report documents the agency's analysis of head-on collisions. The agency seeks public review and
comment on the technical report. Comments received will be used to improve future analyses of the correlation of NCAP
performance and fatality or injury risk.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) has gauged the performance of vehicles in frontal impact tests since model year
1979. In response to Congressional direction, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration studied the relationship
between vehicle test scores in NCAP and the fatality risk in crashes of vehicles on the road. This study is based on head-on
collisions, where the effect of crashworthiness can be separated from the effects of extraneous factors that influence
fatality rates (drivers, roadways, mileage). Collisions between two 1979&hyph;91 passenger cars in which both
drivers were wearing safety belts were selected from the Fatal Accident Reporting System. There were 396 collisions
(792 cars) in which both cars were identical with or very similar to vehicles which had been tested in NCAP. In the analyses,
adjustments were made for the relative weights of the cars, and for the age and sex of the drivers_factors which substantially
affect fatality risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are statistically significant correlations between NCAP scores for head injury, chest acceleration and femur
loading and the actual fatality risk of belted drivers. A composite NCAP score, based on the test results for all three
body regions, has excellent correlation with fatality risk: In a head-on collision between a car with good composite
score and a car of equal weight with poor score, the driver of the car with the better NCAP score has, on average, a 20 to
25 percent lower risk of fatal injury. Slightly smaller, but still significant fatality reductions are obtained
even when the NCAP scores for just one body region (just HIC, or chest g's, or femur load) are used to partition the fleet
into ``good'' and ``poor'' performance groups. The borderline between good and poor NCAP scores that optimizes the
differences in actual fatality risk is close to the criteria specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS)
208 for each of the three body regions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cars built from 1979 through 1982 had, on the average, the poorest NCAP scores. Test performance improved substantially
in 1983 through 1986 models, and continued to improve in 1987 through 1991 cars. In parallel, fatality risk for belted
drivers in actual head-on collisions decreased by 20 to 25 percent in model years 1979&hyph;91, with the largest decreases
just after 1982. The 35 mph test speed for NCAP is 5 mph higher than the test speed for FMVSS 208. By now, most passenger
cars meet the FMVSS 208 criteria at the NCAP test speed. The study shows that achievement of this enhanced level of test
performance has been accompanied by a significant reduction in actual fatality risk. However, being a statistical
study, it does not address what portion of the fatality reduction was directly ``caused'' by NCAP. Also, these results
do not guarantee that any individual make-model with low NCAP scores will necessarily have lower fatality risk than
another make-model with higher NCAP scores.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA welcomes public review of the technical report and invites the reviewers to submit comments about the data and
the statistical methods used in the report. The agency is interested in learning of any additional data that could
be used to expand or improve the analyses, such as information about the curb weights of cars and light trucks.

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose, in the envelope
with their comments, a self_addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will
return the postcard by mail.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
At its meeting on January 3, 1994, the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service voted unanimously to close
to public observation its meeting scheduled for February 7, 1994, in Sacramento, California. The members will discuss
preparations for the rate case filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace, Setrakian and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary
to the Board Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(3) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(c) of Title
39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government
in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information in connection with proceedings
under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with postal ratemaking, mail classification and changes
in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States
code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has determined further that pursuant to section 552b(c)(10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section
7.3(j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern
participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination on the record after
opportunity for a hearing. The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's
discussion of the matter be open to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code;
section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States Code; and section 7.3 (c) and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
