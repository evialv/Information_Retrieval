Section 13301 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, 26 U.S.C. 1391&hyph;1393,
established the Rural Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Program. Under this program, the Secretary of Agriculture
is authorized to designate up to 3 Empowerment Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities in rural areas. This document
authorizes the Under Secretary for Small Community and Rural Development and the Administrator of the Rural Development
Administration to carry out that program.

This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rule making
and opportunity for comment are not required, and this rule is effective January 18, 1994. Further, since this rule
relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order Nos. 12866 and 12778. This
action is not a rule as defined by Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from the
provisions of that Act. This rule also is exempt from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, as
amended (42 U.S.C. Chapter 35).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking implements provisions of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act. The Act amends the
timeframe for household election of a repayment method for intentional Program violation (IPV) claims, changes
retention rates on food stamp recipient claims for State agencies and reduces the enhanced funding rate for the costs
of planning, designing, developing and installing ADP and information retrieval systems. This rule also implements
a provision of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991, relating to household election
of repayment method for inadvertent household error (IHE) claims. This rule also implements a change to ADP requirements
which limits enhanced funding requests for automated systems to initial development of a ``complete'' system and
corrects errors made in previously published regulations relating to recipient claims and enhanced ADP funding.
In addition, this rule clarifies exceptions to requirements to provide notice of adverse action when an allotment
is reduced to recoup a recipient claim and clarifies the Federal funding rate allowed for preparation of a Planning
Advance Planning Document (PAPD). Finally, this rule gives State agencies, at their request, the option to make payment
by check for FNS&hyph;209 amounts due FNS, and to have payments due from FNS to the State made by check in place of amending
the States' letter of credit.

Section 13961 of the Omnibus Budget reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), (Public Law 103&hyph;66), Signed August 10,
1993, reduces the federal reimbursement rate for development of automated data processing and information retrieval
systems development to the standard 50 percent Federal reimbursement level effective April 1, 1994. During the last
week of October 1993 and the first week of November 1993, the Department issued a memorandum which briefed States on
the details of this change in the law. The memorandum will be followed by conforming regulations which will be effective
April 1, 1994.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive
effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which
would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified
in the ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule
or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted.

94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). George Braley, Acting Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified
that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will
affect recipients who must elect a repayment method for IPV claims. State and local agencies which administer the
Food Stamp Program will be affected by the change in retention rates on food stamp recipient claims and the reduction
in the enhanced funding rate for development of ADP system.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 10, 1991, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 46127) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed changes to Food Stamp Program recipient claims
and ADP funding requirements as required by the Mickey Le Lano Memorial Hunger Relief Act, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, (hereinafter
``Pub. L. 101&hyph;624''). The Department received 21 comment letters which addressed provisions of the proposed
rule. FNS has given careful consideration to all comments received. The major concerns of the commenters are discussed
below.

Repayment Decision Timeframe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have shortened the time for participating households to choose how they would repay inadvertent
household error (IHE) and intentional Program violation (IPV) claims in order to forestall involuntary reduction
of their allotments. The timeframe for such elections would have been shortened from 30 days to the day of receipt of
the demand letter for repayment unless the adverse action period for the claim had not elapsed or the household had
timely requested a fair hearing and continued benefits. Public Law 101&hyph;624 mandates the shortened timeframe
for IPV claims. The proposed rule would have also applied this timeframe to IHE claims. The preamble to the proposed
rule should be consulted for the complete discussion of the background of this decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received 13 comments on this part of the proposed rule, 10 from State agencies, one from the welfare department of
a large city, and two from public interest groups. Five State agencies supported the proposal; most other commenters
objected to it, primarily because it applied the shortened timeframe to IHE claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that since the statute spoke only to IPV claims, applying the ``same day'' decision timeframe
to IHE claims was against the law. Several commenters objected to the proposal on the grounds that the shortened decision
timeframe for IHE claims would cause hardship on households, especially those in rural areas, and was in any event
too short to allow adequate time for due process. Two commenters objected to our statement that the proposal would
enhance conformity with Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) rules on claims management. Several commenters
stated that if it were established for either IHE or IPV claims, the ``same day'' standard would impose significant
operational problems on State agencies, and that a 10-day minimum should be adopted for both types of claims. One of
the operational difficulties cited was the need to track responses due at varying intervals because of the consideration
of such circumstances as geography. One commenter believed that the proposed rule required a fair hearing on IPV claims
in addition to an administrative disqualification hearing or comparable action establishing such claims.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In section 911 of Public Law 102&hyph;237, which was signed December 13, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991, Congress resolved this issue by providing that for an IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim, ``the household shall be given notice permitting it to elect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another means of repayment [other than allotment reduction] and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given 10 days to make such an election before the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commences action to reduce the household's monthly allotment.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department understands by this language that no action to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's monthly allotment may be taken by the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the eleventh day following the household's receipt of notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the IHE claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typically households first receive notice about IHE claims through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mail in demand letters. Consequently, there is no practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way to determine exactly when households receive such notices and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in turn, the eleventh day afterwards. There is also the problem of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing for return mail time. This rule provides that within 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of the date of the demand letter, households must notify State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies of their choice of repayment method or be deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elected allotment reduction. This timeframe should allow for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly required 10-day decision timeframe and adequate mail time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five days for delivery to households and five days for household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return mail to State agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, the provision is restated to deal with IHE and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IPV claims separately and to clarify that the timeframe for the IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim repayment decision relates both to initial demand letters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to demand letters following fair hearings which sustain IHE claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, to take account of demand letters which may be handed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household, the language makes clear that the 20-day period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins on the date the demand letter is mailed or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered to the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters objected to the statement in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to the effect that the claim itself was the adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, not the collection action. (This statement was made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with exempting the initiation of allotment reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the adverse notice requirements when households have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided notice about appeal rights on the underlying claim. That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal is discussed later in this preamble.) The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would like to clarify this matter. Current rules require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households be provided specific information about their rights to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal recipient claims. Once this information is provided, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair hearing is requested and a determination to sustain the claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made, the household's remaining decision is how it will pay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim. Making that decision should take relatively little time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify how this policy applies to IHE claims, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that in cases of IHE claims, if a fair hearing sustains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim, the household must notify the State agency of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election of repayment method within 20 days of receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the hearing decision or be deemed to have elected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allotment reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to IPV claims, the final rule provides that households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must elect a method of repayment on the date of receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter required by 7 CFR 273.16(e)(9), 7 CFR 273.16(f)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (g)(3) of current rules (or if the date of receipt is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business day, on the next business day) or be deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elected allotment reduction. The final rule requires that for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IPV claim, the first claim demand letter following an action which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes the claim, inform the household about this timeframe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for election of a method of repayment and the consequence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failing to meet it. This is intended to clarify that the timeframe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for electing a repayment option begins with the demand for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also provides that each State agency must, for IPV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, determine a deadline for the return of completed election 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms in order to determine if the election is timely. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department does not expect State agencies to set such deadlines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case by case. State agencies should establish uniform timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for responses to demands for repayment of IPV claims, if necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing for situations such as mail time to and from remote areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule states that the deadline cannot exceed 10 days from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date that the demand letter is mailed or otherwise delivered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable households. The time period is set at a maximum of 10 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the law requires a ``same day'' decision from households and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a relatively short response time is appropriate to that statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these changes, to accommodate the different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for IHE and IPV claims relating to repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions, the final rule treats IHE and IPV claims in separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections. Furthermore, since recoupment is a method of collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is used only for participating households, when appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule refers to ``participating households.'' In 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.18(d)(4), which contains the policies on repayment decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframes, the heading is changed to ``Further collection actions'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since that more accurately describes the material in the paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, because IHE and IPV claims are treated in separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subparagraphs, the first sentence of paragraph (4)(i) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule has been deleted to eliminate potential confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This deletion also eliminates the redundant phrase ``do not respond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely or fail to respond.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was concerned that a significant number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believed that in reducing the time for electing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment for IHE claims the proposed rule would also have abridged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to appeal the claim. Consequently, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating IHE and IPV claims separately, the final rule sets forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the content of the initial demand letter for IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims separately from the content of a demand letter for IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims which are sustained by fair hearings. An initial IHE demand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter needs to inform the household that it has an option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely electing a repayment method
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
requesting a fair hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A demand letter provided after a hearing decision which sustains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim would not offer the hearing option. Similarly, the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter for an IPV claim can only be issued following an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative disqualification hearing or other action which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes an IPV claim. The rule adds a phrase to clarify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to other comments, the final rule makes several other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes with respect to the required content of the demand letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for IHE and IPV claims. One commenter recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed list of repayment methods in 7 CFR 273.18(d)(3)(iii) be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded to include repayment in coupons. However, a full list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment methods is already contained in 7 CFR 273.18(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of that section already requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter inform the household of these methods of repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in addition to being incomplete, the proposed list in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d)(3)(iii) is redundant, and so the final rule deletes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter pointed out that we do not require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter inform households when recoupment would begin and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of benefits the household would then receive. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that it would be useful to include this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the demand letter. Current rules at 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.18(g)(4) require that prior to reduction State agencies inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households about the effect of recoupment on their benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the final rule provides that, unless the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has otherwise informed the household what its allotment would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net of the reduction for repaying the claim, it provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the demand letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current rules at 7 CFR 273.12(c)(2) provide that decreases in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits must be made effective no later than the month following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lapse of the adverse notice period. Consistent with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general policy and the required timeframe for election of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment method, the final rule provides that the initial demand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter for IHE claims must inform the household that the reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will begin with the first allotment issued after the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either timely elects allotment reduction or, if it fails to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely election, with the first allotment issued after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the time for its election. Demand letters provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent to a fair hearing sustaining an IHE claim must inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household that if it fails to make a timely election, allotment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction will begin with the first allotment issued after timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of such election is due to the State agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter on this paragraph recommended that we be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific about the acceptable ways for households to communicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their decisions about repayment. The Department is not aware of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any operational difficulties with how State agencies and households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently communicate about claims collections. Current rules at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 273.15(h) provide that requests for fair hearings may be oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or in writing so long as they are clear and if they are not, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may ask households for clarification. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourages State agencies to apply this standard to communications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning elections of repayment methods. Consequently, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule does not specify ways households must communicate elections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about repayment methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would have amended 7 CFR 273.13(b) which lists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions from notices of adverse action. As mentioned earlier in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this preamble, the proposed rule would have added situations where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State agency initiates allotment reduction against a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been provided notice of its appeal rights for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying claim to the list of exemptions. No commenter objected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this action or indicated the need for clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the final rule adopts the language as proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 273.13(b)(14). Several commenters did remark about an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated statement in the preamble which was that the claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself was the adverse action, not the collection action. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that the changes in this final rule clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that statement. Households are due notice of specific appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights regarding claims such as how the claim arose, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on which the claim is based, how the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim was calculated and the right to contest the claim. Once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those due process requirements have been met and the claim has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established, State agencies are expected to proceed to collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities without additional notices of adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Technical Corrections to Current Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department used the proposed rule to correct two errors in 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 273.18(d)(3) of current rules which resulted from the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration-Management rule published February 22, 1990 (55 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6233). The first correction clarified that a notice of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is required when a claim is not established in a fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing. It deleted the phrase which limited this requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those circumstances where ``the amount of the claim'' had not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established. The one comment received on this matter was from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency which indicated it was already in compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broader requirement. Consequently, the final rule adopts the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language as stated in the proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second correction reinstated a provision in 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.18(d)(4)(iii) allowing other methods of collecting claims for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IHE and State agency error claims. A commenter objected on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds that the law does not authorize other collection methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for IHE claims. However, section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Food Stamp Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2022(b)(2)(B)) does authorize such collection action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for IHE claims. Accordingly, the final rule adopts the language as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in the proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
State Agency Retention of Claims Against Households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have reduced the recipient claims retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for State agencies from 50 percent to 25 percent for IPV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims and from 25 percent to 10 percent for IHE claims. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule further specified that the new rates are effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the period beginning October 1, 1990 and ending September 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995. Beginning October 1, 1995 the old rates of 50 percent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IPV claims and 25 percent for IHE claims will again take effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also would have allowed State agencies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to submit a one-time request for any additional amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due under the old, higher retention rates by November 30, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four comments were received on this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the proposed rule, the Department had previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed State agencies to implement the new retention rates for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and payment purposes. This was done in order to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Act and to minimize the need for revised reporting on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form FNS&hyph;209, Status of Claims Against Households. Effective with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first quarter Fiscal Year 1991 FNS&hyph;209 report, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been recovering funds from State agencies at the new retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates in accordance with the Act. The Department had also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously advised State agencies of the procedure for requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any additional retention due on collections received prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1990 and the deadline for filing such requests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One State and one local agency felt that the retention rates should be restored to their former levels. The commenters
indicated that the higher retention rates in effect prior to October 1, 1990 were a significant incentive for States
to pursue the collection of Food Stamp Program claims and felt that the new lower retention rates could result in a loss
of State or local support for collection and fraud control activity. The local agency stated that it used the money
to help administer the fraud control program and that the cutback would hamper the county's effort to locate and prosecute
food stamp fraud. The new retention rates were mandated in the Act and do not involve Departmental discretion. Since
the retention rates are mandated by law, the final regulation retains the new retention rates as specified in the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two State agencies commented on the procedure in the proposed rule of claiming only the new retention rates on the FNS&hyph;209
and filing an adjustment request for any additional retention amount due the State agency. The proposed rule provided
that a one-time request to claim the higher rates for transactions occurring on or after October 1, 1990 but involving
collections received prior to October 1, 1990, may be filed with the Department after Fiscal Year 1991 but no later
than November 30, 1991. One State agency believed that States should be given the option of using the old, higher retention
rates on the FNS&hyph;209 if they can identify those collections, or the lower retention rates if it is in the State's
best interest. The commenter felt that States should not be burdened with requesting and justifying higher retention
rates in a special request if their systems are able to identify those collections that qualify. Another State agency
recommended that there be no time limitation to filing a request and that States should continue to receive the higher
retention amount due under the higher rates in effect prior to October 1, 1990 if all other conditions are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not adopting the suggestion to allow State agencies to claim higher retention rates for collections
received prior to October 1990 on the FNS&hyph;209 rather than requiring submission of an adjustment request. The
FNS&hyph;209 and the FNS automated system which supports State reporting are structured to recognize one retention
percentage for each type of claim. Edit checks are designed to detect mathematical errors and inadvertent under-
or over-retention for each claims category prior to the Department accepting the report. Instead of redesigning
the FNS&hyph;209 and the automated system, the Department is permitting State agencies to claim for the additional
retention by submitting an adjustment request after the end of the fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also not adopting the suggestion to eliminate the time limitation for filing a request for retention
adjustment, but has decided to allow State agencies an additional year to claim any additional retention. The proposed
rule allowed a one-time request for retention adjustment and specified a deadline of November 30, 1991 for filing
the request. In October 1992, the Department advised State agencies that it would allow a second round of adjustment
requests after Fiscal Year 1992 which must be filed no later than November 30, 1992. Accordingly, the final rule allows
State agencies to submit a first time request (if they have not previously done so), or second request for additional
retention which must be filed no later than November 30, 1992. The Department believes the additional year should
be sufficient time for any adjustments, transfers, and refunds of collections received in Fiscal Year 1990 or earlier
to be adjusted and claimed by State agencies at the old, higher retention rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also using this opportunity to update the reference in the proposed rule concerning amending the
States' letter of credit for FNS&hyph;209 payments to reflect current practice. The proposed rule restated current
policy in that it provided that FNS would collect amounts due FNS or pay State agencies by amending the States' letter
of credit. Although in most cases the State agency owes FNS for FNS' share of collections, FNS may owe the State agency
in situations where the retention amount due the State agency exceeds the cash collection. This occurs when the State
agency experiences a preponderance of non-cash rather than cash collections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 7 CFR 273.18 and 276.2 previously provided that FNS would collect amounts due FNS for recipient
claims collections and title IV reimbursements and pay State agencies by offsetting or amending the States' letter
of credit. However, in order to accommodate State and Federal financial management requirements, FNS has accepted
FNS&hyph;209 payments by check from a number of State agencies and has sent checks to State agencies which were owed
money. The Department believes it is appropriate to change the current language to provide for checks when requested
by State agencies rather than require a number of State agencies to conform to the letter of credit procedure. In the
final rule the Department is allowing State agencies to request that FNS accept checks from the State for FNS&hyph;209
amounts due FNS, or that FNS pay the State by check for FNS&hyph;209 amounts due the State. If such a request has not been
or is not made, payment to the State agency and collection from the State agency will be made through the letter of credit.
The Department reserves the right to offset any amount due FNS by letter of credit offset if payment is not made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also amends similar provisions relating to title IV reimbursements in 7 CFR 276.2 and letter of credit
offsets in 7 CFR 277.16 to conform with this change. Title IV reimbursements are reported as a separate line item on
the FNS&hyph;209 and are used along with claims collection data in the calculation of the total amount due FNS from
the FNS&hyph;209. Thus, a change in the method of collection or payment of the total amount due from the FNS&hyph;209
would also apply to the line items that make up the total figure. The change in the general authority for letter of credit
offset in 7 CFR 277.16 is a consolidation of the authority for organization purposes. As noted above, the regulations
in 7 CFR 273.18 and 276.2 previously allowed FNS to offset from the letter of credit for FNS&hyph;209 payments due FNS.

Automated Data Processing (ADP) Enhanced Funding Rate Reduction to 63 Percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule stated that section 1752(a) of Public Law 101&hyph;624, enacted on November 28, 1990, changed the
enhanced funding rate for ADP and information retrieval system development from 75 percent to 63 percent effective
October 1, 1991. The proposed rule also stated that pursuant to section 1752(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;624 this change
in the funding rate does not apply to proposals approved prior to the enactment date of November 28, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received which stated that this reduction is unreasonable at a time when automation efforts need
to be increased to keep pace with growing caseloads and decreasing resources. One other commenter stated that this
reduction was unfair to those States that had never requested enhanced funding because they had not previously had
the necessary resources available for development purposes and that were now in the process of pursuing such development.
The reduction in the enhanced funding rate was mandated by law and does not allow Departmental discretion. Since the
retention rate is mandated by law, the final regulation retains the 63 percent rate as specified in the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested clarification of whether approval of the planning advance planning document (PAPD) prior
to November 28, 1990, constituted total project approval at the enhanced funding rate. The Department believes that
the purpose of the PAPD is to determine whether the developing system would be a viable one and whether continued system
development is appropriate. Therefore, approval for funding a PAPD is separate from later funding decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was also made aware of concerns about the approval of funding proposals after November 28, 1990 that
were submitted prior to that date. Specifically, there was a concern that States which had submitted complete implementation
advance planning documents (IAPD) prior to November 28, 1990, but did not receive approval by FNS until after that
date were being unfairly penalized. The Department reviewed the legislation in light of this concern and has made
a change in 7 CFR 277.4(b)(12) of the final rule. This section now provides that a State will receive 75 percent enhanced
funding for automated system development, if prior to November 28, 1990, the State had both an approved (PAPD) and
had submitted an IAPD along with all the paperwork required for approval. However, modifications to approved IAPDs
and any increase in costs which occur after September 30, 1991 (during system development), will be funded at the 63
percent level. Other than this modification, 7 CFR 274.4(b)(12) is adopted as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
One-time Enhanced Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine comments were received on the proposed one-time enhanced funding provision which provided that all requests
for more than one-time enhanced funding for automated system development in a particular State be denied. These comments
focused on the rapid pace of changes in technology and the need for federal enhanced funding to allow States to incorporate
these changes into a system once the initial system development has been completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the proposed rule, a 1988 audit issued by the General Accounting Office (GAO) interpreted the original
legislation differently than the Department. According to GAO, the funding scheme was initially designed so that
enhanced funding for automation should only be available for a State's first attempt at automation development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FNS recognizes the concern expressed by commenters to keep pace with the rapid change in computer technology. However,
the legislative history accompanying Public Law 96&hyph;249, The Food Stamp Amendments of 1980, specifically addressed
the funding of upgrading or modification of a system originally funded at the enhanced level. In the House Report the
Committee stated that the 75 percent rate for cost sharing was intended to be one-time and funds were to be strictly
limited to initial development. H.R. Rep. No. 96&hyph;788, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. 112&hyph;113 (1980). Ongoing system
utilization or upgrading expenses would be shared at the 50 percent level applicable to most other administrative
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the House Report and the General Accounting Office (GAO) audit cited in the proposed rule, the Department
has decided that enhanced funding should not be available for system changes to an already existing system which was
initially developed with enhanced funding. Accordingly, with some technical corrections described later, the
proposed &sect;277.18(g)(1) is adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also wants to clarify that it will fund one ``complete'' system development effort at the enhanced
level one time, if the system meets all applicable standards. A ``complete'' system contains both certification
and issuance components that meet existing standards. For example, a State may receive enhanced funding for the development
of a certification component of a system which meets all of the applicable functional standards. The State may then
also receive enhanced funding for a subsequent project to ``upgrade'' the system by adding an issuance component
which also meets all of the applicable functional standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States are currently given the opportunity to pay back the difference between regular and enhanced funding for a partial
system (i.e. certification component only) and then move forward to develop a ``complete'' new system. As of (insert
effective date of final rule), States will no longer be given the opportunity to pay back this difference. The Department
will fund to ``complete'' system development but will not permit paybacks that allow the State to replace at enhanced
levels a component already funded at the enhanced level which is no longer useful in the new system design. For example,
a State has received enhanced funding for a certification component and completes component development. At a later
date, the State re-evaluates automation activity and a decision is made to automate the issuance function, and to
redo the certification component. In this situation, the Department may allow enhanced funding for the issuance
component but will not allow funding at the enhanced level for a new certification component. Finally, if a ``complete''
system was funded at the enhanced level, a replacement system is not eligible for enhanced funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will reimburse States at the enhanced level, if appropriate, for ``planning efforts'' that did not
lead to implementation of a system. The purpose of the planning effort is to ensure that the ultimate system development
effort is a viable one. Therefore, a State may qualify a second time for enhanced funding for planning if the previous
planning effort was not successful. However, a State will not be eligible for enhanced funding for the actual implementation
efforts for the second time if the initial implementation effort failed to develop a ``complete'' system that meets
all applicable standards. Paybacks by States for failed implementation attempts will no longer be approved as of
(insert the effective date of the final rule).

Federal Funding for Preparation of the Planning Advance Planning Document (PAPD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed rule provided clarification that the 50 percent rate of Federal Financial Participation (FFP) would
be allowed for State administrative expense incurred during preparation of the PAPD. Two commenters felt that the
preparation of a PAPD should be funded at the enhanced rate since the preparation took more time than suggested in the
regulations and resulted in a document more extensive than 6&hyph;10 pages. One commenter suggested that a clear
description of specific costs eligible for enhanced funding would help to adequately differentiate between preparation
of the PAPD and the actual planning phase activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is maintaining the requirement that the preparation of the PAPD by States be funded at the regular FFP
rate of 50 percent. The PAPD is intended to be a brief written plan of action which describes the State agency's intended
activities and proposed budget for planning phase activities as well as an estimate of the total project costs. At
a minimum, the State agency is required to include information set forth in 7 CFR 277.18(d) in the PAPD submission.
Planning phase activities will be reimbursed at the enhanced rate only if the PAPD was approved at that rate. Planning
phase activities that are eligible for reimbursement at the enhanced funding rate are identified in 7 CFR 277.18(g)
of these regulations. In addition, the Department would like to clarify language in paragraph 277.18(g)(8)(iv)
of that section which may have contributed to the confusion surrounding the level of FFP allowed for the preparation
of a PAPD. The second sentence in this paragraph has been changed to read as follows: ``The cost of planning activities
which were approved for enhanced funding under a Planning APD may be funded at the 63 percent level regardless of final
approval or denial of the Implementation APD''.

Miscellaneous Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the Department had failed to provide recipient protections in ADP systems through the proposed
rule and requested that the Department republish the rule to include provisions for this concept. Through this rule
the Department is addressing only the automation funding provision of the Public Law 101&hyph;624. Public Law 101&hyph;624
also contains provisions concerning standards for automated systems that include concerns about recipient protection.
However, this rule does not implement those provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is primarily interested in the use of automated systems to provide more timely and accurate benefits
to recipients as well as more program and system accountability and the APD process, the Department is emphasizing
recipient protection when a system is under development as well as when the system is operational. Notices, expedited
service and processing procedures are being emphasized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested clarification regarding whether ``development'' of an automated system includes transfer
and modification of an existing State system in an enhanced funding situation. The Department believes that current
regulations at &sect;&sect;272.10(a)(3) and 277.18(d)(2)(ii) adequately address the requirement that a State,
as part of the development of its automated system, assess whether the transfer or modification of an existing State
system is cost effective. Transfer or modification may be reimbursed at either the regular or enhanced funding levels
according to the criteria discussed above.

An additional change is contained in these final provisions in order to correct language in 7 CFR 277.4 and 277.18 of
current regulations. There is a typographical error in 7 CFR 277.4(b) (11) and (12), 277.18(b), under the definitions
for enhanced funding or enhanced FFP and regular funding or regular FFP, and in 7 CFR 277.18(g)(1) and 277.18(g)(3).
The word ``or'' appearing after the word ``development'' and before the word installation in these sections has been
changed to ``and''.

The provisions of this action relating to household election of repayment method for IPV claims at 7 CFR 273.18 are
effective retroactive to November 28, 1990, when Public Law 101&hyph;624 was enacted. The provisions at 7 CFR 273.18
relating to household election of repayment method for IHE claims is effective December 13, 1991, the date of enactment
of Public Law 102&hyph;237. The provisions at 7 CFR 273.18 which reduce State agency retention rates on claim collections
applies, by its terms, to the period beginning October 1, 1990 and ending September 30, 1995. Therefore, the new retention
rates are effective retroactively to October 1, 1990. The provision at 7 CFR 277.18 which reduces the enhanced funding
level for ADP is effective retroactively to October 1, 1991 for costs incurred on that date and thereafter and does
not apply to ADP plans approved prior to November 28, 1990. The corrections to the Administration Management final
rule, the correction to the reference to enhanced ADP funding, the change to FNS&hyph;209 methods of payment and the
amendments relating to one-time enhanced funding and to Federal funding for preparation of Planning APD's are effective
30 days following the date of publication of this final rule.

The following retention rates shall

apply for claims collected by the State agency, including the value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of allotment reductions for the purpose of collecting claims but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not allotment reductions due to disqualification: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For amounts collected prior to October 1, 1990, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency shall retain 25 percent of the value of inadvertent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household error claims collected and 50 percent of the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intentional Program violation claims collected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For amounts collected during the period October 1, 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through September 30, 1995, the State agency shall retain 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the value of inadvertent household error claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected and 25 percent of the value of intentional Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation claims collected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For amounts collected on or after October 1, 1995, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency shall retain 25 percent of the value of inadvertent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household error claims collected and 50 percent of the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intentional Program Violation claims collected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The State agency shall not retain any percentage of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of administrative error claims collected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The State agency shall retain the value of funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected for inadvertent household error, intentional Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, or administrative error claims rather than forwarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the payments to FNS. This amount includes the total value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allotment reductions to collect claims, but does not include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of benefits not issued as a result of a household member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being disqualified. The State's grant and letter of credit will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established or amended on a quarterly basis to reflect the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's retention of the value of claims collected as specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (h) of this section unless the State agency requests or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has requested that payment be by check. The State agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request that FNS accept checks from the State for FNS&hyph;209 amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due FNS, or that FNS pay the State by check for FNS&hyph;209 amounts due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State. If the State agency fails to pay FNS the amount due as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported on the FNS&hyph;209, FNS shall offset the amount due from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's letter of credit. For FNS&hyph;209 reporting purposes, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies shall calculate the retention amount using the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate specified in paragraph (h) of this section which is in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the reporting period for the report. For those claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected in Fiscal Year 1990 or earlier for which adjustments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made and reported in Fiscal Year 1991 or 1992, States may request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a correction to reflect the difference between the old, higher rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(paragraph (h)(1) of this section) which is applicable to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, and the new, lower rate (paragraph (h)(2) of this section) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at which the adjustments to those claims were reported on the FNS&hyph;209. One request for correction for each of
fiscal years 1991 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 may be filed with FNS after the fiscal year, but no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1991 for Fiscal Year 1991 reporting and no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1992 for Fiscal Year 1992 reporting. The request must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be in writing, must include appropriate verifying documentation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and must reflect the net effect of all increases and decreases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the application of the old retention rate.

FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, reviewed the safety of the additive and the chemical impurities
that may be present in the additive resulting from its manufacturing process. Although the additive itself has not
been shown to cause cancer, it has been found to contain minute amounts of unreacted ethyl acrylate, a carcinogenic
reactant used in the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids, such as ethyl
acrylate, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food additives.

I. Determination of Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A), the so-called
``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation
of the data available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21
CFR 170.3(i)) define ``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientist that the substance
is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticancer or Delaney clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides that no food additive shall be
deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause
applies to the additive itself and not to impurities in the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been
shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general
safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm
will result from the proposed use of the additive.

)-trione will result in exposure to the additive of no greater than 100 parts per billion (ppb) in the daily diet (Ref.
1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,
the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies, subchronic studies, and teratological
studies on the additive. No adverse effects were reported in these studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and
using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by ethyl acrylate, a carcinogenic
chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. This risk evaluation of the carcinogenic impurity ethyl
acrylate has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive; and
(2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.

A. Ethyl Acrylate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using risk assessment procedures, FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to ethyl acrylate from
the petitioned use of the additive in the manufacture of polyester elastomers and rubber articles for repeated use
and currently regulated uses to be 380 parts per quadrillion of the daily diet (3 kilograms), or 1 nanogram (ng) per
person per day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from the National Toxicology Program report (No. 259: 1986), a bioassay
on ethyl acrylate, to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming
from the proposed use of the additive and the level of ethyl acrylate that may be present in the additive (Ref. 3). The
results of the bioassay on ethyl acrylate demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for rats and mice under
the conditions of the study. The test material induced squamous cell neoplasms in both sexes of F344/N rats and B6C3F

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the potential exposure of 1 ng per person per day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime
risk from the use of the 3,5-di-

, or 8.1 in 100 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, the actual lifetime
averaged individual exposure to ethyl acrylate is expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake,
and therefore the calculated upper-bound limit of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm from exposure to ethyl acrylate would result from the proposed use of 3,5-di-

The agency has also considered whether a specification is necessary to control the amount of ethyl acrylate impurity
in the food additive. The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because
of the low level at which ethyl acrylate may be expected to remain as an impurity following production of the additive,
the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of food at other than extremely small levels; and (2)
the upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this impurity, even under worst-case assumptions, is very
low, less than 8.1 in 100 billion.

C. Conclusion on Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of the additive
in polyester elastomers in contact with dry food and rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food
is safe. Based on this information, the agency has also concluded that the additive will have the intended technical
effect. Therefore, &sect;178.2010 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.

III. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

IV. Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before February 18, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objection thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objection received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 OMB Circular A&hyph;133 establishes audit requirements and defines Federal responsibilities for implementing
and monitoring such requirements for institutions of higher education and other nonprofit institutions receiving
Federal awards. It supersedes Attachment F, subparagraph 2h, of Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative
Requirements for Grants and other Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit
Organizations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of Circular A&hyph;133 apply to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal departments and agencies responsible for administering programs that involve grants, cost-type contracts
and other agreements with institutions of higher education and other nonprofit recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions whether they are recipients receiving awards
directly from Federal agencies, or are subrecipients receiving awards indirectly through other recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 27, 1992, the Department published an interim rule at 57 FR 33252 to adopt the provisions of the circular. The
rule adopted the provisions of Circular A&hyph;133 by adding to Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, a new PART
45_NON-FEDERAL AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND OTHER NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. Part
45 incorporates the requirements set forth in Circular A&hyph;133. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule also made numerous technical changes throughout the parts of Title 24 in order to make the cross-referencing
and conforming changes necessary for implementation of Circular A&hyph;133. Included in these technical changes
were a number of changes needed as a result of the definition of ``Federal financial assistance,'' as set forth in the
circular. That definition now covers loans, loan guarantees, and insurance. Therefore, programs that make, guarantee,
or insure loans to nonprofit mortgagors have been brought within the coverage of Circular A&hyph;133, as it is implemented
at part 45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for HUD programs whose regulations are set forth in 24 CFR parts 207, 213, 221, 232, 236, 242, 277, 880, 881,
883, 884, 885, 886, 889, and 890, a nonprofit institution is the nonprofit corporation which owns the individual property
receiving the HUD assistance. Each project under the parts 200 series and many projects under the parts 800 series
are required to complete project-specific audits because they are deemed to be separate entities. The audits currently
conducted under applicable HUD audit guides for these programs will serve as the organization-wide audits required
by OMB Circular A&hyph;133 and this part. In performing the compliance review required by paragraph 13.c. of OMB Circular
A&hyph;133, auditors should consider the compliance requirements set forth in the OMB Compliance Supplement. In
accordance with the regulatory agreement incident to the insured mortgage, where HUD provides federal funding,
the audit reports pertaining to nonprofit organizations subject to these regulations are to be submitted within
60 days after the end of the fiscal year audited. Each of the parts listed in the first sentence of this paragraph is amended
to cross-reference to part 45. The details of coverage of entities receiving assistance under these parts is contained
in section 45.1(c).

Parts 889 and 890 are programs regarding supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities, respectively.
The regulations for these programs were developed after the publication of the interim rule. Nonetheless, the projects
under these programs are required to complete project-specific audits because they are deemed to be separate entities.

The public was given 60 days in which to submit comments to the interim rule published on July 27, 1992, at 57 FR 33252,
and comments were received from three commenters: One nonprofit organization, one certified public accounting
firm, and one national association of certified public accountants. Below is a listing of the issues raised by the
commenters and the Department's response and resolution of those issues.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for a compliance audit performed by an independent accountant seem to be redundant, time-consuming,
and costly, especially where municipal and county requirements include monthly financial and compliance reports,
and both municipal and county officials perform inspection of the records, programs and procedures. Nonprofit organizations
that are subrecipients should be allowed to continue adherence to the guidelines in Circular A&hyph;110. [one nonprofit
organization and one certified public accounting firm]

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accommodation of this comment is not feasible. OMB issued Circular A&hyph;133 to supersede portions of Circular
A&hyph;110 and clearly included, under the A&hyph;133 coverage, funds received as a subrecipient. The Department
is implementing the provisions of the circular and has no flexibility in this matter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule should be effective for years beginning on or after August 26, 1992, the effective date stated for the rule.
However, the revisions to paragraph 45.1(d) state that the requirements are applicable to fiscal years beginning
on or after January 1, 1990. An effective date of January 1, 1990 requires institutions to retroactively apply OMB
Circular A&hyph;133, creating an undue hardship on those institutions and their auditors. [one national association
of certified public accountants]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The date in the summary of the interim rule (August 26, 1992) relates to when the audit is conducted, and the date in section
45.1 (fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1990) relates to the period audited. Circular A&hyph;133 specifies
that audits of periods beginning on or after January 1, 1990 will be covered. The Department is merely implementing
OMB policy.

as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;133 (including hospitals that are not affiliated with an institution of higher
education) *&blank;*&blank;*.'' However, section 1.k. of the Attachment to Circular A&hyph;133 excludes hospitals

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The substitution of Circular A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions,
for Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment F, subparagraph 2h (which covered grants to universities, hospitals, and other
nonprofit organizations) left open the issue of coverage of hospitals. The explanation for this omission, advanced
by OMB, was that most hospitals receive reimbursement from the federally funded Medicaid and Medicare programs,
each of which has its own statutory audit requirements. Albeit hospitals which are affiliated with universities
are covered by Circular A&hyph;133 by reason of that affiliation and non-university affiliated hospitals, which
receive federal funds pursuant to research contracts, are subject to contract closing audits, there still remained
a policy decision of coverage of non-university affiliated hospitals that may be receiving HUD assistance. Therefore,
under section 45.1(b) of the interim rule, the coverage was continued under Circular A&hyph;133 for non-university
affiliated hospitals that receive HUD assistance. The decision to extend coverage to this group of hospitals receiving
HUD assistance was made as a matter of policy. Any hospital receiving Federal funds should, as a matter of sound fiscal
management, receive audit reviews of the use of those funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule makes final the interim rule that is discussed above. The following four programs are added to its coverage
by this final rule, since the regulations for these programs were developed after the publication of the interim rule:
PART 92_HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM, PART 572_HOPE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES PROGRAM (HOPE
3), PART 889_SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY, and PART 890_SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.
As discussed earlier in this preamble, the projects under parts 889 and 890 are required to complete project-specific
audits.

This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning
and Review, issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes made in the rule subsequent to its submission
to OMB are identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the Office of the Rules Docket

The content of this rule does not constitute a development, nor affect the physical condition of project areas or building
sites, but relates only to auditing and fiscal functions. Thus, the authorities and standards of &sect;50.4 of 24
CFR part 50 (the regulations implementing Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969) are
inapplicable to this rule; therefore, it is categorically excluded from the NEPA requirements pursuant to &sect;50.20(k).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing its decision to approve a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Colorado program), under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendment consists of changes to provisions of Colorado's rules concerning backfilling and grading for the elimination
of highwalls, and limited variances from approximate original contour (AOC) requirements. The amendment is intended
to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations and to improve operational
efficiency.

On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program for the regulation
of coal exploration and coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed
explanation of the conditions of approval can be found in the December 15, 1980,

II. Submission of Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated March 19, 1993, Colorado submitted to OSM a proposed amendment to the rules of the Colorado Mined Land
Reclamation Board (Board) at 2 Code of Colorado Regulations (CCR) 407&hyph;2 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;536).
Colorado submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its March 19, 1993, amendment, Colorado proposed to revise 2 CCR 407&hyph;2, Rule 4.14.1(2), performance standards
for underground mining operations and remining operations; Rule 4.14.2, modifications by the Colorado Division
of Minerals and Geology (Division) to the general backfilling and grading requirements for steep-slope, underground,
and remining operations; and Rule 4.27.4, variances from AOC requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 14, 1993 (58 FR 19367), announcing receipt of the proposed amendment to the Colorado program and inviting
public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO&hyph;541). The public comment period was scheduled
to end May 14, 1993. However, in response to a request for an extension of the public comment period, OSM published a
notice in the May 12, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 27967) extending the public comment period until May 29, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;545).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns with Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g), regarding the need for
a written demonstration that all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill a highwall;
Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g), regarding the need to define the term ``reasonably available spoil''; Rules 4.14.1(2)
(f)(iii) and (g)(iii), regarding the need to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority that a highwall
remnant is stable; and Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)(i), regarding the need to require that all reasonably available spoil within
the permit area be used to eliminate a highwall. OSM notified Colorado of these concerns by letter dated July 8, 1993
(administrative record No. CO&hyph;553).

Colorado responded in a letter dated August 4, 1993, by submitting additional explanatory information and a revised
amendment (administrative record No. CO&hyph;559). Specifically, Colorado proposed additional revisions to
(1) Rule 1.04 (103a) to include a definition of the term ``reasonably available spoil''; (2) Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding
a demonstration by the applicant in writing that an existing highwall was in place prior to August 3, 1977, and that
the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall and face-up area
so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3; (3) Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)(i), regarding the requirement that all reasonably available
spoil in the permit area be used to backfill a highwall; (4) Rules 4.14.1(2)(f)(iii) and (g)(iii), regarding the requirement
that the operator demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Division that a highwall remnant is stable; and (5) Rule 4.14.1(2)(g),
regarding the allowance for incomplete highwall elimination for remaining operations that contain a preexisting
highwall where the operator demonstrates in writing to the Division that the volume of all reasonably available spoil
is insufficient to completely backfill a reaffected or enlarged highwall so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the revised amendment in the August 30, 1993,

a public hearing on the adequacy of the amendment considering the additional materials submitted (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;570). The comment period closed on September 14, 1993.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds
that the proposed amendment, as submitted by Colorado on March 19, 1993, and as revised by it on August 4, 1993, is no
less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.

1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Colorado's Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado's proposed revisions to the following previously-approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature and consist
of minor editorial, punctuation, and codification changes. Corresponding Federal provisions, if any exist, are
listed in parentheses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.14.1(2)(h) (30 CFR 816.102(d) and 817.102(d)), placement of spoil on the area outside the mined-out area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.14.2(1)(a) (30 CFR 816.102(b) and 817.102(b)), general slope grading requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.27.4 (30 CFR 816.102(a)(1) and (2), 817.102(a)(1) and (2), 816.133(d) and 817.133(d)), limited variances
from AOC requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved Colorado rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director
finds that these proposed Colorado regulations are not inconsistent with SMCRA and are no less effective than the
Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At newly-created Rule 1.04(103a), Colorado proposed to define the term ``reasonably available spoil'' that would
apply to backfilling and grading operations and highwall elimination on continuously mined areas (Rule 4.14.1(2)(f),
finding No. 3) and on remaining operations on previously mined areas (Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), finding No. 4). Colorado
proposed to define ``reasonably available spoil'' to mean ``spoil and suitable coal mine waste material generated
by a remaining operation, or other spoil or suitable coal mine waste material located in the permit area that is accessible
and available for use and that when rehandled will not cause a hazard to public safety or significant damage to the environment.''
Colorado's proposed definition is substantively identical to the corresponding Federal definition of the term
``reasonably available spoil'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rule 1.04(103a)
defining the term ``reasonably available spoil'' is no less effective than the corresponding Federal definition
of ``reasonably available spoil'' at 30 CFR 701.5. The Director approves the proposed rule.

3. Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), Exception From the Requirement for Complete Highwall Elimination for Continuously Mined
Areas at Underground Mining Operations

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to recodify existing Rule 4.14.1(2)(f) as 4.14.1(2)(h) and add a new Rule 4.14.1(2)(f). At Rule
4.14.1(2)(f), Colorado proposed requirements for underground mining operations that have highwalls or face-up
areas that were in place prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and have continued to operate in the same
location after that date. In this rule Colorado proposed an exception from the requirement for complete elimination
of face-up areas and highwalls for underground mining operations of an applicant demonstrates in writing to the Division
that the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall and face-up
area so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3. Such face-up areas and highwalls would have to be eliminated to the maximum
extent technically practical. Furthermore, Colorado proposed at Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v) that (1) all
reasonably available spoil in the permit area shall be used to backfill the highwall and that reasonably available
spoil in the vicinity of the operation shall be included in the permit area, (2) the backfill shall be graded to a slope
that is compatible with the approved postmining land use and that provides adequate drainage and meets a minimum static
safety factor of 1.3, (3) the highwall remnant shall be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the public health
and safety or to the environment and the operator shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the
highwall is stable, (4) exposed coal seams, toxic and acid-forming materials, and combustible materials shall be
adequately covered or treated in accordance with Rule 4.14.3, and (5) spoil placed on the outslope during mining operations
that occurred prior to August 3, 1977, shall not be disturbed if such disturbance will cause instability of the remaining
spoil or otherwise increase the hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal backfilling and grading regulations at 30 CFR 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) allow an exception from the
requirement for complete highwall elimination for underground mining operations that remine highwalls in ``previously
mined areas,'' which by definition are those that existed prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and
are not subject to the standards of SMCRA. These regulations allow for the incomplete elimination of such highwalls
where the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the reaffected or enlarged
highwall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's proposed rules differ from the Federal regulations in that Colorado proposed to extend the exception
for incomplete highwall elimination to underground mining operations where highwalls or face-up areas were in place
prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and have continued to operate in the same location after that date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director has approved similar proposed regulations for Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah (52 FR 49398, 49399,
December 31, 1987; 56 FR 21304, 21330&hyph;21331, May 23, 1990; 58 FR 48600, 48603, September 17, 1993). Colorado's
proposed rules and Kentucky's, West Virginia's and Utah's approved regulations address the situation of operators
attempting to reclaim face-up entry areas that are created prior to the passage of SMCRA. Many of these underground
mines have been in existence for many years and the earthen material necessary to eliminate the face-up entry is either
no longer available or has been completely revegetated and its handling and use would cause new environmental damage
and disruption. This problem is unique to underground mines where highwall areas do not move with the coal removal
operations (as with surface mines) but exist in a static state for many years. The problem is not encountered in surface
mines where post-SMCRA operations are continually creating new highwalls rather than extracting coal from pre-SMCRA
highwall areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In passing SMCRA, Congress addressed the surface impacts of underground mining and surface extraction of coal in
a generally similar manner, but it did provide for important differences. In section 516 of SMCRA, Congress affirmatively
established certain performance standards applicable to underground mines and incorporated by reference other
performance standards at section 515. One of the performance standards incorporated by reference, section 515(b)(3),
requires highwall elimination. However, section 516(b)(10) also requires that the Secretary shall make such modifications
in the requirements imposed by this subparagraph as are necessary to accommodate the distinct difference between
surface and underground coal mining.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah provisions, the Director exercised his authority as the Secretary's designee
to consider these distinct differences between surface and underground mines and approved them. The Director reasoned
that the provisions provided equitable treatment for pre-SMCRA mines that have operated continuously since before
the effective date of SMCRA. They also afforded the same variance from AOC requirements as is provided in 30 CFR 817.106
for remining sites where operation of a pre-SMCRA mine has been interrupted and mining was begun again at the sites
after the
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; effective date of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons discussed above for the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah proposed regulations, the Director
finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v) are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) or any other requirements of the Federal regulations or SMCRA, insofar as they
apply to underground mining operations that operated prior to August 3, 1977, and have continuously operated since
that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director wishes to emphasize that any exception to SMCRA's requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls,
including the exception for continuously mined areas, must be construed and implemented in a carefully limited manner
and should ensure that the highwall is removed to the maximum extent technically practical (48 FR 41720, 41729, September
16, 1983). Thus, for example, where an underground mining operation has been continuously mined since before the
effective date of SMCRA (August 3, 1977) and contains both pre- and post-SMCRA face-up or portal areas, this exception
must be understood as applying only to the pre-SMCRA face-up areas. Any post-SMCRA portal areas within the same mining
operation must comply with the requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado has confirmed that the exception proposed at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f) would apply only to those face-up areas or
highwalls that were created prior to August 3, 1977, and that any face-up area or highwall initially formed after August
3, 1977, at an underground mining operation would be subject to the requirements for complete highwall elimination
under the approved Colorado program (administrative record No. CO&hyph;538).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Director approves Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to add Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), which allows for an exception to the requirement for complete highway
elimination at remining operations initiated after August 3, 1977, on sites that were mined and abandoned prior to
August 3, 1977, and contain a preexisting highwall, when the operator demonstrates in writing to the Division that
the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the reaffected or enlarged highwall
so as to achieve a static safety factor of 1.3. In such instances, the highwall must be eliminated to the maximum extent
technically practical and must comply with criteria proposed at Rules 4.14.1(2)(g) (i) through (v), which are addressed
in finding No. 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's proposed rules are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b)
(1) through (4), 817.106(b) (1) through (4), 816.102 (a)(3) and (f), and 817.102(a)(3) and (f). For this reason, the
Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(g) (i) through (v) are no less effective than the counterpart
Federal regulations and approves them.

 Existing Colorado Rule 4.14.1(2)(a), which has been previously approved by OSM, provides that the AOC of an area disturbed
by surface mining must be restored ``[e]xcept as specifically exempted in these Rules.'' Colorado proposed to eliminate
the general phrase ``[i]n these Rules'' and replace it with specific references to all of the provisions of the Colorado
program that provide exemptions from the requirement to restore AOC. The referenced exemptions include proposed
Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) and 4.14.1(2)(g) and existing Rules 2.06.5, 4.14.1(2)(e), and 4.27.4.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), which has no counterpart in the Federal regulations, provides a limited exemption from
the requirement to restore AOC when the operation is an underground mining operation that contains a highwall or face-up
area that was in place prior to August 3, 1977. For the reasons discussed in finding No. III.3., this exemption is no
less effective than the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed rule 4.14.1(2)(g) provides an exemption from the requirement to restore AOC for remining operations initiated
on sites that contain a preexisting highwall. For the reasons discussed in finding No. III.4., this exemption is no
less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(3) and (f), 817.102(a)(3) and (f),
816.106(b) (1) through (4), and 817.106(b) (1) through (4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Rules 2.06.5 and 4.27.4, which were previously approved by OSM, provide an exemption from the requirement
to restore AOC in steep-slope mining situations. This exemption is no less effective than the counterpart Federal
regulation exemptions at 30 CFR 785.16, 816.102(a) (1) and (2), 817.102(a) (1) and (2), 816.133(d), and 817.133(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) provides that, for an underground mining operation, excess material not required to
eliminate all highwalls and depressions need not be returned to AOC as required by the general grading requirements
at Rule 4.14.2 if the operation demonstrates compliance with the applicable hydrologic balance, topsoil, excess
spoil, and revegetation requirements at Rules 4.05, 4.06, 4.09, and 4.15 and the Division approves this practice.
Rule 4.14.1(2)(e), which was previously approved by OSM, has no direct counterpart in the Federal regulations but
has a general counterpart in the Federal backfilling and grading regulations at 30 CFR 817.102(a)(1). The applicable
part of this regulation requires that disturbed areas for underground mining operations be backfilled and graded
to achieve AOC. Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) provides a specific underground mining exemption to returning or blending excess
material to AOC. The Director interprets this rule to mean that an underground mining operation's disturbed area,
including all highwalls and depressions, must be backfilled and returned to AOC and that any excess material deposited
outside the disturbed area must be blended with the surrounding terrain to achieve AOC. When narrowly interpreted
in this manner to apply to underground mining activities, and not to surface mining activities, and only to excess
spoil material remaining after AOC of the disturbed area has been achieved, Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) is not inconsistent
with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.102(a)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations corresponding to proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) are found at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(1) and 30 CFR
817.102(a)(1). Like the proposed rule, the Federal regulations contain specific references to the portions of the
Federal regulations that provide exemptions to the requirement to restore AOC. Since the proposed revision would
add specificity and clarity to the existing rule, and since each exemption referenced by the proposed revision is
no less effective than the counterpart exemption in the Federal regulations, the Director finds the proposed revision
to be no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations and approves it.

Colorado's proposed exceptions to the requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Existing Colorado Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) also provides that spoil must be graded to eliminate all highwalls, spoil piles,
and depressions. Colorado proposed to further revise Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) to provide for two exceptions to this requirement.
The first exception provides that spoil need not be graded to eliminate all highwalls if the operation is an underground
mining operation that meets the criteria of Rule 4.14.1(2)(f). The second exception provides that spoil need not
be graded to eliminate all highwalls if the operation is a remining operation on a site mined and abandoned prior to
August 3, 1977, pursuant to Rule 4.14.1(2)(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 30 CFR 817.102(a)(2) provide for two exceptions
to the requirement that all highwalls be eliminated. The first exception is for small depressions pursuant to 30 CFR
816.102(h). The second exception is for highwalls in previously mined areas pursuant to 30 CFR 816.102(k)(3)(iii)
and 30 CFR 816.106.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in finding No. III.3., Colorado's first proposed exception, concerning underground mining operations
that contain a highwall or face-up area that was in place prior to August 3, 1977, has no direct Federal counterpart
and is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.106(a), (b), and (b)(1) or any other requirements
of the Federal regulations or SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding No. III. 4., Colorado's second proposed exception, concerning remining operations, is no
less effective than the counterpart Federal exceptions at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 30 CFR 817.102(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed revision would provide for exceptions to the requirements to eliminate all highwalls that have
been determined to be no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations, the Director approves the proposed
revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.14.2(1) to allow modification of the slope grading requirements at Rule 4.14.2
by referencing existing exceptions to the backfilling and grading requirements at Rule 4.27, regarding performance
standards for variances from AOC restoration requirements for steep-slope mining, and Rule 4.14.1(2)(e), regarding
variances for excess spoil at underground mining operations from AOC requirements if the spoil is not needed to eliminate
highwalls and depressions. In addition, Colorado referenced proposed exceptions to the backfilling and grading
requirements at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding the exception for complete elimination of certain highwalls at underground
mining operations, and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), regarding the exception for complete highwall elimination for remining
of sites mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977. In doing so, Colorado proposed to delete ambiguous language allowing
for modification of the slope grading requirements for lands that had not been restored in accordance with Colorado's
program and where insufficient spoil was available to otherwise comply with Rule 4.14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.14.2(1)(b) to incorporate exceptions to the requirement for complete elimination
of highwalls by referencing proposed Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.27.4(1), regarding variances from the requirements to meet AOC for steep-slope
mining operations, and to incorporate a reference to the proposed highwall elimination variance provisions as set
forth in proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) for underground mining operations and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g) for remining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of these rules proposed by Colorado, the corresponding Federal regulations are found at 30 CFR 816.102(a)
(1) and (2) and 817.102(a) (1) and (2). These Federal regulations require that disturbed areas be backfilled and graded
to achieve AOC, except as provided at 30 CFR 816.102(k) and 817.102(k), concerning variances from AOC for postmining
slopes, and that all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions be eliminated, except as provided at 30 CFR 816.102(h)
and (k)(3)(iii) and 817.102(h) and (k)(3)(iii), concerning small depressions and previously mined areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Colorado's proposed revisions to Rules 4.14.2(1) and (1)(b) and 4.27.4(1) would simply provide for appropriate
references in these rules to other Colorado rules that OSM has previously approved or is approving in this notice,
the Director finds that the proposed revisions are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)
(1) and (2) and 817.102(a) (1) and (2) that identify, by reference to other Federal regulations, the exceptions to
the requirements for AOC and complete elimination of depressions, spoil piles, and highwalls. Therefore, the Director
approves Colorado proposed Rules 4.14.2(1) and (1)(b), and 4.27.4(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter expressed support for and endorsed adoption of Colorado's proposed amendment. The commenter stated
that the amendment allows the Division to make sound scientific reclamation judgments based upon site-specific
conditions and ensures an environmentally sound reclamation configuration. The commenter recognized that the
amendment does not represent a blanket exemption from complete highwall elimination for preexisting operations
but requires applicants to make a specific demonstration in order to qualify for the exemption. Lastly, the commenter
stated that the amendment provides an appropriate balance between the responsibilities of the operator to make an
adequate demonstration, and the Division's responsibility to evaluate each submittal in light of the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees with the commenter that the amendment does not provide a ``blanket exemption'' from complete
highwall elimination for preexisting operations (those operations existing prior to August 3, 1977, the date SMCRA
was passed). An operator must use all reasonably available spoil to backfill highwalls that were created before August
3, 1977, and continued to be used thereafter (finding No. III.3.) and to backfill remined highwalls that were initially
mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977 (finding No. III.4.). In either of these situations, if the volume of reasonably
available spoil exists for the operator to completely backfill the highwall, the operator must do so under Colorado's
proposed rules. As the commenter stated, an operator must under Colorado's proposed rules completely backfill the
highwall unless the operator demonstrates that the volume of spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall.
For these and the other reasons discussed in finding Nos. III.3. and 4., the Director is, as requested by the commenter,
approving Colorado's proposed rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, on behalf of several individuals, expressed opposition to Colorado's proposed amendment and requested
that OSM reject it. Specifically, the commenter stated that regulators have caused much of the breakdown in coal enforcement
by cutting ``special deals'' that overlook violations and sidestep rules to accommodate coal operators. The commenter
further stated that Colorado's proposed amendment represents a ``special deal'' for some Colorado operators and
urged OSM to reject it for several reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that the Federal law and rules (30 CFR 817.102) require complete elimination of highwalls at
operating mines and Colorado cannot adopt rules that are less strict than the Federal law and rules (30 U.S.C. 1253
and 30 CFR part 732).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees that section 515(b)(3) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 817.102(a)(2)
require the elimination of all highwalls. However, section 516(b)(10) of SMCRA requires that the Secretary shall
make such modifications in the requirements imposed by this subparagraph as are necessary to accommodate the distinct
difference between surface and underground coal mining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated in finding No. III.3. above, the Director exercised his authority as the Secretary's designee
to consider these distinct differences between surface and underground mines and approved Colorado's proposed
regulations that allow incomplete elimination of highwalls for underground mining operations where the highwall
was created prior to August 3, 1977, but continued to be used thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the rationale of the finding and the substantive similarity of Colorado's proposed regulations to regulations
previously approved in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah, the Director does not agree with the commenter's assertion
that Colorado's proposed rules allowing for incomplete elimination of highwalls are less strict than the Federal
law and rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter also stated that ``Congress found highwalls to be one of the most destructive impacts of irresponsible
coal mining'' and that ``[t]hey cause serious erosion and land instability, threaten human and animal safety, and
degrade the beauty and usefulness of public and private lands (E.g., See U.S. Senate Report 95&hyph;128, 1977, p.
51).'' The commenter has mischaracterized Congress' statements in the referenced report. The cited section of this
report does not specifically address highwalls. It states that

[i]f surface mining and reclamation are not done carefully, significant environmental damage can result. In addition,

of coal waste piles, subsidence and mine fires.

While OSM realizes that unreclaimed highwalls left by irresponsible operators could cause such adverse impacts
as identified by the commenter and Congress, OSM does not find that highwalls retained by responsible operators in
accordance with Colorado's proposed rules would cause such adverse impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding Nos. III.3. and III.4. above, Colorado has proposed regulations at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding
incomplete elimination of highwalls for continuously mined areas that are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) and 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), regarding incomplete
elimination of highwalls for remining operations in previously mined areas that are substantively identical to
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b) (1) through (4), 817.106(b) (1) through (4), 816.102(a)(3) and (f),
and 817.102(a)(3) and (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Colorado's proposed regulations and the corresponding Federal regulations include provisions that protect
against erosion and land instability, as well as the threat to human and animal safety. Specifically, Rules 4.14.1(2)(f)
(ii) and (iii) and 4.14.1(2) (ii) and (iii) require that a retained highwall be backfilled and graded to meet a minimum
static safety factor of 1.3 and that a highwall remnant shall be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the
public health and safety or to the environment. In addition, before any highwall remnant is retained, the operator
must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the highwall remnant is stable. The Director believes
that Colorado's proposed rules, which are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations, provide
sufficient safeguards to ensure that highwall stability is achieved and that threat to public health and safety or
to the environment are prevented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that the Division makes the misleading claim that its proposed rules put underground mines on
equitable footing with remining operations. The commenter asserted that, in fact, Colorado's proposed amendment
will significantly reduce the environmental standards for mines that have operated continuously since 1977. The
commenter further stated that the Federal rules allow remining operations to meet lower environmental standards
and leave some highwalls because they are cleaning up abandoned mines that might otherwise not be reclaimed. The commenter
asserted that the Division proposes to treat all existing underground mines as remining sites and deny the public
the protections promised by law and to allow underground mines to escape their obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director does not agree with the commenter's assertions and statements. Colorado's proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)
requires face-up entry areas and highwalls to be eliminated to the maximum extent technically practical using all

apply to both continuously mined areas and remining operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, underground mines can be designated as remining operations only if they qualify for such status in accordance
with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106. Therefore, not every underground mining operation currently
in existence in Colorado is automatically extended the designation of ``remining operations'' on previously mined
areas. Accordingly, unless an underground mining operation began prior to August 3, 1977, and continued operations
into permanent program approval or qualified as a remining operation, the operator is required to completely eliminate
the highwall. As a result, the public is not denied the protections promised by SMCRA, nor are underground mine operations
allowed to escape reclamation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter asserted that Colorado's proposed amendment contains no clear, measurable standards for judging
compliance and success. As an example, the commenter cited the fact that the Division has not clearly defined ``reasonably
available spoil'' and that determining whether an operator has backfilled properly will be left to the judgment of
the operator and the Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director notes that this comment was submitted on May 28, 1993, prior to Colorado's addition on August 4, 1993,
of the definition of ``reasonably available spoil.'' This definition is substantively identical to the corresponding
Federal definition of ``reasonably available spoil'' (finding No. III.2.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM believes the definition of ``reasonably available spoil'' and the Director's clarifications in finding No.
III.2. above include sufficient detail and safeguards to preclude improper implementation of highwall reclamation
rules. If Colorado implements these rules in a manner that is not consistent with the Director's findings, OSM will
address this issue in the oversight of the Colorado program and require Colorado to further modify its rule language
in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17 or take other appropriate actions regarding the implementation and enforcement
of its rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the commenter asserted and alleged that for a number of years, the Division has signed ``settlement agreements''
that allow operators to use lower standards in order to sidestep various performance standards and compliance deadlines.
As an example, the commenter alleged that two recent ``settlement agreements'' were made to allow mines to avoid elimination
of highwalls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that this use of ``settlement agreements'' is unacceptable and represents Division-sanctioned
licenses to violate the law, and that the Division and the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board do not have the legal
authority to set aside the law or create lower standards.The commenter further stated that these agreements and other
Division actions allow operators to continue violations, escape compliance deadlines, meet lower reclamation
standards, and avoid full sanctions for serious violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the commenter requested that, within 60 days, OSM take the necessary steps to (1) revoke the settlement agreements,
(2) achieve compliance at all mines with all rules and deadlines, and (3) prohibit the Division and Board from entering
into similar settlement agreements in the future. The commenter also requested that OSM provide biweekly progress
reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director acknowledges the commenter's assertions and requests. Regarding the request by the commenter that
OSM revoke any settlement agreements entered into by the State of Colorado and an operator, OSM has been notified by
Colorado that it has revoked the two settlement agreements that the commenter is referring to. Regarding the other
requests by the commenter that OSM achieve compliance at all mines with all rules and deadlines, prohibit the Division
and Board from entering into similar settlement agreements in the future, and provide biweekly progress reports,
the Director must also decline to take action on these requests. Any violations of the approved Colorado State program
are subject to enforcement by the State regulatory authority. Should the State fail to enforce its program, OSM, upon
determining that such a failure did, in fact, occur, would use the Federal enforcement mechanisms available to it
to ensure compliance with SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the rationale set forth above in responding to the commenter's concerns and assertions, the Director does
not find Colorado's proposed rules less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director
does not comply with the commenter's request to reject Colorado's proposed amendment pertaining to backfilling
and grading for the elimination of highwalls and limited variances from AOC requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated June 24, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;551), the Mine Safety and Health Administration
(MSHA) responded that the proposed amendment did not appear to conflict with any current MSHA regulations. By a second
letter dated October 15, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;579), MSHA commented that while no direct conflict
between Colorado's proposed changes to its rules and current MSHA regulations can be found, one item may cause future
concern. Specifically, MSHA commented that Colorado's proposal to allow partial reclamation of highwalls means
that any remnant of a highwall remaining after final reclamation creates the potential for misinterpretation to
the extent that a mining company may not consider a [highwall] remnant to be a highwall while MSHA may, in certain situations,
consider a remnant to be a highwall.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees with MSHA that no direct conflict exists with Colorado's proposed amendment. In addition, OSM
refers MSHA to the discussions at finding Nos. III.3. and 4. above, wherein Colorado's proposed Rule 4.14.1(f)(iii),
regarding continuously mined areas, and Rule 4.14.1(g)(iii), regarding remining operations, requires highwall
remnants to be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment. The
operator must also demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the highwall remnant is stable. Colorado's
proposed rules are substantively identical to the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b)(3) and
817.106(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a mining company may not consider a remnant to be a highwall, the company must, upon approval of this amendment,
comply with Colorado's proposed rules addressing performance standards for highwall remnant stability. Consequently,
the potential for misinterpretation of what constitutes a highwall remnant is minimal. The Director notes that if
MSHA's regulations contain additional performance standards regarding highwall remnants, MSHA is not precluded
from applying them.

V. Director's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves Colorado's program amendment as submitted on March 19, 1993, and
revised on August 4, 1993. As discussed in finding Nos. III.1. through III.5., the Director has determined that Colorado's
proposed regulations addressing backfilling and grading for the elimination of highwalls, and limited variances
from AOC requirements are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director is approving the proposed
rules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by
OSM and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 906 codifying decisions concerning the Colorado program are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is an administrative change. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Justice Department
could not require FOIA/PA requesters to provide notarized signatures to prove their identities, finding the policy
clashed with other Federal law. Based on that ruling, the DoD Privacy Office has determined that DOD Component rules
having a similar requirement for notarized signatures must be amended to eliminate the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the Office of the Inspector General, DOD, is amending its rules to eliminate the requirement for notarized

Executive Order 12866. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined
that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis
of the rule indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter
the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or
the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

Only upon proper identification will any individual be granted access to records which pertain to him/her. Identification
is required both for accurate record identification and to avoid disclosing records to unauthorized individuals.
Requesters must provide their full name and as much information as possible about the record being sought in order
that a proper search for records can be accomplished. Inclusion of a telephone number for the requester is recommended
to expedite certain matters. Requesters applying in person must provide an identification with photograph, such
as a driver's license, military identification card, building pass, etc.

Clean Air Act Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA or Act) requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or
implement new ones. Carbon monoxide (CO) areas with moderate area designation are required to implement the vehicle
inspection and maintenance program described in section 182(a)(2)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA was also directed to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the
Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. All areas required by the Act to have an I/M program
were to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. CO nonattainment areas with design classifications of 12.7 ppm and
below were required to meet EPA guidance for ``basic'' I/M programs. These areas were required to submit a SIP revision
to incorporate a basic I/M program by November 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Oregon a basic I/M program is required in the following urbanized areas: Portland and Medford-Ashland Oregon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Basis for Approval
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes an approval of the committal SIP is appropriate in this case because the state could not be expected to
begin developing an I/M program meeting the requirements of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation
was adopted as a final rule, which occurred on November 5, 1992. EPA does believe that states can adopt revised I/M program
plans within one year of EPA's final rule. Oregon submitted an I/M SIP on November 15, 1993 which contains all of the
elements in the implementation schedule, including authorizing legislation and implementing regulations. The
1993 submittal also included an analysis of the program using the most current EPA mobile source emission model demonstrating
that the program meets the applicable performance standard, among other features.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two
years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately
in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective March 21, 1994, unless, by February 18, 1994, notice
is received that adverse or critical comments will be received. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn
before the effective date by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another
will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments
are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective March 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)) (see 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 11, 1993 (58 FR 42711) to exempt natural cedar pesticides, labelled, or for which claims are made, only to
repel arthropods other than ticks, or to retard mildew growth, from regulation under FIFRA. The Agency concludes
that use of these pesticides for these purposes poses negligible risks to human health or the environment and that
the burden imposed by regulation is not justified. Accordingly, EPA is establishing this final exemption. Natural
cedar pesticides labelled with claims of repelling ticks or for which claims are made to repel or otherwise mitigate
ticks, are not included in the exemption. Ticks can be vectors of significant diseases affecting humans, and EPA has
not yet fully evaluated whether or not such an exemption is justified. Thus, regulation of such pesticides is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption will not apply to any cedarwood product that is treated, combined or impregnated with any additional
substances. EPA has determined that natural cedar itself poses little or no risk and does not pose unreasonable adverse
effects on the environment. However, EPA has not made any such finding for cedar when it is mixed with any other ingredients.
Thus, to qualify for this exemption, the pesticide must only contain natural cedar and cannot contain any inert ingredients.
For example, if cedar is painted or soaked in any substance, it would not qualify for the exemption. Likewise, if cedar
chips or shavings are mixed with other ingredients, the exemption would not apply. Natural cedar products, however,
may be packaged and still qualify for the exemption.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Public Comment and Agency Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the Agency solicited comments on the proposed exemption from regulation of cedar pesticides
labelled for use to repel arthropods (except ticks) or to retard mildew. Six sets of comments were received. Three
commenters supported the proposed rule and three objected to it. EPA also invited suggestions for additional candidates
for consideration for possible future exemption. Two commenters suggested such candidates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposal included the term ``chips'' to describe the exempted pesticide. American Wood Fibers of Jessup Maryland,
Inc. requested that the word shavings be inserted in the rule in addition to the term chips. Shavings is the term used
more often in the industry. In response to this comment, EPA has added the term ``shavings'' to the final rule. This
is not a significant change since all forms of cedar products (except cedar oil) were intended to be covered by the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Zinc Association and Alltrista Zinc Products Company and Roussel UCLAF Corporation responded to the Agency's
invitation to suggest other low-risk pesticide candidates for exemption from regulation. American Zinc and Alltrista
requested that zinc metal strips used for preventing moss, fungus and mildew on roofs be considered; Roussel UCLAF
Corporation requested review of rotenone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the proposal to this exemption, EPA recognizes that there may be other low-risk pesticides that would also
be appropriate for exemption under section 25(b). EPA is currently evaluating existing pesticide registrations
to identify other potential candidates for exemption or reduced regulation. EPA will include in this consideration
the two pesticides, zinc metal strips and rotenone, that were identified as potential candidates in the comments
submitted on the proposed cedarwood exemption. Moroever, as discussed in the proposed exemption, EPA plans to evaluate
whether or not cedar oil extracted from plant parts is appropriate for exemption. EPA also plans to evaluate in the
future whether or not it is appropriate to exempt cedar products for which claims such as ``repels ticks'' are made.
If EPA determines that any of the above-described exemptions are warranted, EPA will publish a proposed rule on such
exemptions and provide an opportunity for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chlorobenzene Producers Association [CPA]; Excell Products Corporation; and Willert Home Products opposed
the cedarwood exemption. Each are, or represent, producers of alternative products for moth repellence which compete
with cedar products. Their objections and the Agency's response to each are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Consumers will be harmed and cedar competitors placed at a disadvantage if natural cedar pesticides are exempted.
CPA and Excell Products assert that a number of competing products to cedar are produced and distributed by small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency disagrees that the proposed exemption of natural cedar will result in harm to consumers. As described in
the proposal, the risk to humans or the environment associated with natural cedar is low. The natural oils in the wood
and other plant parts are present at low levels and little exposure to users or the environment is likely. Cedar products
have been sold and widely used for many years with no known health or environmental effects. EPA's regulatory authority
under FIFRA is primarily a licensing authority; every decision has some potential effect on competitors. The Agency
does not consider potential impact on competitors to be a valid and sufficient reason to preclude this exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cedar is ineffective for pest control purposes and cedar companies will be emboldened to make false and misleading
claims without regulatory oversight. Marketing of refresher oils for cedarwood strengthens the impression that
natural cedar is limited or ineffective in pest control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not endorsing the effectiveness of natural cedar as a repellent or for mildew prevention purposes. Because
of the very low risk to man or the environment associated with cedar products, even if the commenters' claims of low
efficacy are true, EPA believes the low risk nature of cedar justifies this exemption. EPA believes the marketplace
is sufficient to suppress ineffective products. The Agency acknowledges that excessive and misleading claims may
be associated with any products exempted from regulation, including cedar products. The Agency does not endorse
or encourage use of excessive or misleading claims for cedar, but believes this is a circumstance where market choices
will restrain abuse and ineffective products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Agency has already assisted the cedar industry with expedited review procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expedited review procedures were employed for several cedar registrations in large part because the Agency considered
these pesticides to pose little or no risk to man or the environment. All supporting data for natural cedar products
were waived except descriptions of processing the wood and analyses for oil content. The Agency concludes that the
low risk associated with natural cedar does not justify the cost of regulation, including the reduced costs associated
with the expedited review procedures cited above, for either society or the Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This proposal improperly implies that natural substances are safe and synthetics are hazardous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees that not all natural substances are safe and that not all synthetics are hazardous. Natural cedar,
however, is low-risk for both humans and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The public health risk from exposure to natural cedar may not be negligible; lack of information suggesting risk
does not support a finding of no unreasonable risk. This commenter [CPA] believes the statute requires a finding of
no unreasonable adverse effect on the environment to support the exemption. CPA also concludes that exemption based
on low exposure is inconsistent with prior Agency pesticide policy and that EPA's statutory obligations are not diminished
when a pesticide also has non-pesticidal uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees that lack of information, in and of itself, is not sufficient to justify exemption. In the case of
cedar, however, the point is reinforced from many years of distribution and widespread use of cedar with no known adverse
effect. There is very little exposure likely for humans or the environment to the natural oils. Cedarwood oil typically
occurs in cedarwood at low levels and cannot easily be separated from the wood or plant product. Consumers using cedarwood
products are unlikely to be exposed to significant amounts of dust or oil either by inhalation or through the dermal
route. Moreover, EPA believes that cedarwood oil, when used as it naturally occurs in blocks, chips, or other plant
parts, is not expected to result in any significant environmental exposure and cedarwood oil is not known to persist
or bioaccumulate in the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIFRA section 25(b)(2) authorizes the Administrator to exempt a pesticide if it is determined to be ``of a character
which is unnecessary to be subject to this Act in order to carry out the purposes of this Act.'' Consistent with the comment
from CPA, EPA has determined that cedarwood products, as defined in this rule, pose negligible risks to human health
and the environment and do not pose unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Thus, EPA has concluded that
these products are of a character which is unnecessary to be subject to the Act. As discussed in the proposal of this
rule, the term unreasonable adverse effect is defined at FIFRA section 2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the
environment, taking into account the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide.''
EPA believes that natural cedar pesticides pose little or no risk to human health or the environment and that the regulatory
burden imposed by registration of these products is not justified by the negligible risk posed by them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the commenters offered any evidence that would contradict this finding. The only evidence of risk presented
was reference to mechanical injury if a child swallowed a small cedar ball. This comment cited a reference in materials
submitted by a cedar registrant to their product and labelling warning to keep the product away from children. The
Agency agrees that any object small enough to swallow should be kept from small children. If the sole risk posed by cedarwood
products is the risk of children swallowing them, that alone is not a sufficient basis for EPA to regulate them under
FIFRA. FIFRA was designed to address the unique concerns presented by pesticides. EPA does not believe that this type
of physical risk, in the absence of any other pesticidal risk, justifies regulation under FIFRA. Other Federal, State
and local authorities exist that could be used to address this type of risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CPA also commented that EPA is required to find that, to be eligible for exemption under FIFRA section 25(b)(2),
a pesticide product satisfies ``other objectives'' of FIFRA such as meeting statutory criteria for registration
with respect to labeling and composition. In the case of cedar, the Agency concludes that labelling requirements
typically applied to pesticides are not necessary to prevent unreasonable risk to humans, including children (excluding
products with claims involving public health issues). Determinations regarding product composition, labeling
or other aspects of regulatory constraint are unnecessary given the low risk potential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency disagrees with CPA's assertion that consideration of lack of exposure is inconsistent with prior EPA pesticide
policy. The Agency has previously exempted pheromones citing low exposure as one factor in the decision to exempt
[47 FR 33717].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Excell Products Corporation urged that registrations for natural cedar pesticides issued prior to the exemption
not be continued if the exemption is established. They are concerned that this would create a false impression of government
endorsement for the registered articles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not intend to register additional natural cedar pesticides (unless claims for ticks are made _ see
discussions above). It is expected that existing registrations will be voluntarily cancelled after the rule becomes
effective. Registration is never an endorsement of a pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The low risk associated with pesticidal use of natural cedar does not justify the cost of regulation to society or the
Agency. There is no reason to believe that mis-use or disposal of natural cedar pesticides will increase potential
risk. The Agency concludes that use of natural cedar pesticides as described in the proposed regulation will not cause
unreasonable adverse effects on humans or the environment, whether regulated under FIFRA or not. None of the commenters
offered any evidence that would contradict these conclusions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption will relieve regulatory burdens for those companies and products consistent with the terms and conditions
described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with FIFRA section 25, the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) has waived review of the proposed and final
rule. The Secretary of Agriculture waived review of the proposed rule and agreed to waive review of the final rule if
it is the same as the proposed rule. A copy of the final rule was forwarded to the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Copies
of the final rule also were forwarded to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee
on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a section of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public safety,
or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another Agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354; 94 Stat.1164, 5 U.S.C.
601 et seq.). EPA has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small businesses, small governments or small organizations given the impacts forecasted pursuant to the analysis
conducted under Executive Order 12866 as set forth above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, I certify that this rule does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no information collection requirements. Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 is not
applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with FIFRA section 25, the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) has waived review of the proposed and final
rule. A copy of the final rule has been forwarded to the U.S. Department of Agriculture before publication. Copies
of the final rule also were forwarded to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee
on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate.

 In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62071), EPA issued a proposal to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d) to establish an exemption from
the requirement of a tolerance for trimethylolpropane (CAS Reg. No. 77-99-6) when used as an inert ingredient (component
of water-soluble film) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only with a limitation that it will not
exceed 15% of the pesticide formulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted with the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Montana has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Montana's application
and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Montana's hazardous waste program revision satisfies
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Montana's hazardous
waste program revisions. Montana's application for program revision is available for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.

B. Montana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Montana received partial Phase I Interim authorization in February, 1981. Complete Phase I authorization was received
in February, 1982. Final authorization of the base program was received in July, 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed Montana's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Montana's hazardous waste
program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Montana. The public may submit
written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 18, 1994. Copies of Montana's application for
program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Montana's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to
the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is
received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response
to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft application was submitted on January 7, 1991. The State of Montana addressed all of EPA's concerns prior to
submittal of the final application. Thus, the Montana program is granted immediate final authorization for the provisions
in the following Table.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Montana's program revisions include a requirement that conditionally exempt small quantity generators keep records
of waste analyses for three years (ARM 16.44.402(2)(d)). This provision is broader in scope than the federal requirement
and is not a part of the federally authorized program. Requirements more stringent than those of the federal program
are found in ARM 16.44.402(3) and 16.44.109(19). These provisions require annual, rather than biennial, reporting
for state generators and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. More stringent provisions are a part of the
federally authorized program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Montana's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Montana is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the State of Montana and the Environmental Protection Agency may have potential disagreement as to the scope
of the State's jurisdiction over certain lands within ``Indian Country'', as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, Montana has
not requested authorization of its hazardous waste program, as revised, within ``Indian Country'' in Montana. Accordingly,
today's decision to grant Montana final hazardous waste authorization, as revised, does not extend to ``Indian Country''.
The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous waste authority under RCRA which applies to ``Indian
Country'' in Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Montana now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and previously
approved authorities. Montana also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to
conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to issue orders under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Montana has submitted draft applications for the hazardous waste program provisions in clusters non-HSWA V and VI,
HSWA I and II, and RCRA I and II.

Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Montana's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule identifies a community, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP), that will be suspended on the effective date listed within this rule because of failure to enforce
floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has taken action to bring their floodplain management program into compliance
with NFIP requirements prior to the effective suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn
by publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement
measures. The community listed in this document no longer meets that statutory requirement for compliance with program
regulations, 44 CFR part 59 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, the community will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of that date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the community. However, the community may submit the required documentation to bring
its floodplain management program in compliance with the NFIP regulatory standards, after this rule is published
but prior to the actual suspension date. If the documentation is submitted and approved by FEMA, the community will
not be suspended and will continue its eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension
of the community will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, FEMA has identified the special flood hazard areas in the community by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. No direct Federal
financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction or acquisition of buildings in the identified
special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP and identified for more than a year, on FEMA's
initial flood insurance map of the community as having flood-prone areas (Section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes
effective for the communities listed on the date shown in the last column. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This community received a 90-day, and two 30-day notifications addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that the
community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective suspension
date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

unless an appropriate public body adopts and enforces adequate floodplain management measures. The community listed
no longer complies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community
unless it takes remedial action.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice denies a petition submitted by Mr. Robert Crail requesting the agency to reconsider a final rule that added
control line pressure balance requirements to the pneumatic timing requirements applicable to air brake systems.
Mr. Crail's petition was based on his allegations that NHTSA had not adequately considered the added costs to trailer
manufacturers imposed by the rulemaking, including the hardware costs to achieve compliance with the new control
line pressure balance requirements and the costs associated with certifying compliance with those requirements.
In response to this petition, the agency has reexamined the final rule's evaluation of additional costs for this requirement
and again concludes that those additional costs are not excessive or unreasonable. Therefore, Mr. Crail's petition
is denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 21, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending the pneumatic timing requirements of Standard No. 121, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Air Brake Systems,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 with respect to the control line pressure balance for tractor trailer combinations (57 FR 37902). In that notice,
the agency adopted a dynamic test procedure for determining the control signal pressure differential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that preceded this final rule, Mr. Crail and the Truck Trailer
Manufacturers Association (TTMA) stated that they believed that measuring control line pressure balance in a dynamic
test instead of in a static test would result in excessive costs. Mr. Crail, who is employed by a trailer manufacturer,
stated that the total cost of a dynamic test would be approximately $6,000, as compared to his estimated cost of $900
for a static test. Similarly, TTMA believed that a dynamic test procedure would require trailer manufacturers to
purchase expensive equipment, such as transducers and recording equipment, costing as much as $6,000. TTMA estimated
that the static test apparatus would cost about $300 per manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding these comments, NHTSA adopted a dynamic test procedure to evaluate control line pressure differential
in the August 1992 final rule. The agency concluded that the static control line pressure differential test advocated
by Mr. Crail and TTMA would not adequately evaluate the pressure differential problem. The agency also determined
that the costs associated with the new dynamic test were reasonable and would be well below the levels estimated by
Mr. Crail and TTMA. The agency explained this determination as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency notes that most trailer manufacturers already own the most expensive portion of this test equipment for
conducting timing tests (i.e., the data recorder/power supply/signal conditioning apparatus), and that the mini-tractor
test rigs that are currently used in compliance testing with Standard No. 121 could be readily upgraded to check for
pressure differentials for an additional cost of $300. Of this cost figure, $100 would cover the hose, gladhands,
and air flow restrictor and $200 would cover the cost of upgrading the software of the test rig. NHTSA notes that the
practical effects of these requirements are limited to only those trailer manufacturers who build towing trailers
(i.e., trailers used in doubles or triples operations). Such towing trailers currently constitute a very small percentage
of the trailer market. 57 FR 37904.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In short, the agency concluded that most trailers would not be subject to the new dynamic test for control line pressure
balance and those that were would face added costs of about $300.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Robert Crail filed the lone petition for reconsideration of this rule. Mr. Crail stated that the agency did not
adequately consider the cost impact that would be imposed on trailer manufacturers to equip trailers with new hardware
necessary to achieve compliance with the new requirements. The petitioner also believed that NHTSA did not adequately
consider the cost impact on manufacturers to obtain or adapt test equipment to test trailers for compliance with the
new requirements. The agency will address each of these assertions in turn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In his petition for reconsideration, Mr. Crail contends that NHTSA seriously underestimated the cost impact per
trailer of adding additional equipment to comply with the final rule. According to Mr. Crail, trailer manufacturers
could comply with Standard 121 prior to this amendment without incorporating a relay booster valve on their trailers.
However, again according to Mr. Crail, the August 1992 final rule in effect requires the use of relay booster valves
on trailers. Mr. Crail estimates that the cost to the trailer manufacturer to add these valves would range from $26
to $54.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that Mr. Crail's initial assertion about a trailer's ability to comply with Standard 121 without incorporating
a relay booster valve on trailers is incorrect. The agency notes that the majority of trailers required a relay booster
valve to comply with the requirements adopted on May 3, 1989 (54 FR 13890, 85&hyph;07, Notice 3). However, the control
line pressure requirements of the August 1992 notice did not have the effect of requiring that an additional valve
be added to the system. The August 1992 requirements only required that valves used to comply with the May 1989 requirements
did not induce unwanted pressure differentials. Therefore, NHTSA believes that the amendment in question did not
have the effect of requiring a relay booster valve where none was required before.

Other Hardware Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA further believes that Mr. Crail's assertions about the rulemaking's hardware costs are incorrect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency considered these same assertions about hardware costs when it was developing the August 1992 rule. In that
rule, NHTSA indicated that some manufacturers might have to use higher quality relay valves than they presently use
to meet the requirements, but that these higher quality valves are not significantly more expensive. In addition,
the agency acknowledged that manufacturers may have to modify existing valve designs to control pressure differential.
However, the agency estimated that such modified valves would cost only a few dollars more per trailer. Moreover,
the final rule also indicated that these upgraded valves would only be needed on towing trailers. The total annual
production of towing trailers is roughly 21,400. Therefore, the agency concluded that the aggregate costs for additional
equipment on all trailers to comply with the control line pressure balance requirements would be relatively small.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its review of Mr. Crail's petition for reconsideration, NHTSA once again reviewed the hardware costs associated
with the control line pressure balance requirements. The agency concludes that valves that would be needed to meet
the August 1992 rule are not significantly more expensive that those used prior to the rule. To illustrate, Bendix,
a valve manufacturer, has designed a new valve that it advertises as complying with these new requirements. These
valves actually cost less than valves previously used in trailers to control for pressure balance. Accordingly,
NHTSA continues to believe that its initial determination that the hardware costs associated with the rulemaking
are not unreasonable is correct.

Testing Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Crail also asserted that the agency seriously underestimated the costs to trailer manufacturers for testing
compliance with the new dynamic test procedure. As noted above, NHTSA stated in the final rule that the mini-tractor
test rights that are currently used to test compliance with other requirements in Standard No. 121 could be readily
upgraded to check for pressure differentials at an added cost of about $300. Mr. Crail asserted that, on top of the $300
costs estimated by NHTSA, there would be nearly $5900 of additional costs to record the pressure data collected during
the prescribed test. The $5900 estimate consisted of two sets of pressure transducers and cables, at a cost of $600
per set, a strip chart recorder, at a cost of about $4000, and approximately $700 in labor costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Crail also stated that trailer test rigs commonly used by trailer manufacturers cannot be simply adapted to the
additional tasks of recording pressure tracers simultaneously at both the trailer's input and delivery gladhands,
as the agency suggested in the preamble to the final rule. Instead, Mr. Crail asserted that manufacturers would have
to equip the test rig with at least three additional pressure transducers and a recording device capable of three channel
input.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees. Through tests conducted at the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) and conversations with a
Gooch Brake and Equipment Company, a manufacturer of mini-tractor test rigs, NHTSA concludes that trailer manufacturers
need not equip their test rigs with additional pressure transducers and a recording device costing approximately
$5900. As explained in the final rule, most trailer manufacturers use test rigs, known as ``variables'' test equipment,
for a variety of timing and pressure testing of vehicles in certifying compliance with Standard No. 121. Therefore,
a manufacturer typically will not have to procure test equipment solely to comply with the new rule. Rather, most manufacturers
can easily upgrade their current test rig to evaluate the pressure differential through the following modifications
at a cost of about $300: Adding a hose, gladhands, and an air flow restrictor, for approximately $100; and upgrading
the test rig's software, for $200. While it is true that the total cost of ``variables'' test equipment would be approximately
$6000 to $7000, a trailer manufacturer that already owns the test rig would incur an incremental cost of $300 to comply
with this amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA further notes that the petitioner's assertions appear to be based on a belief that a trailer manufacturer must
use the test procedure and testing equipment described in Standard No. 121. Such a belief is incorrect. The National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act) requires each manufacturer to certify that its vehicles meet Standard
No. 121. Accordingly, the vehicle must meet the applicable requirements of Standard No. 121 when tested by NHTSA according
to the test procedure specified in the standard. However, the Safety Act does not require a manufacturer to use the
standard's test procedure or specified test equipment. A manufacturer may use a variety of means to certify compliance,
including, among other things, engineering analyses, actual testing, and computer simulations, provided that
due care is exercised in making its certification. If the manufacturer exercised due care, it would not be subject
to civil penalties for manufacturing and selling a noncomplying vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, a manufacturer need not conduct these operations itself. Manufacturers can utilize the services of independent
engineers and testing laboratories. The can also join together through trade associations to sponsor testing or
analysis. Another alternative is for manufacturers, such as trailer manufacturers, to rely on testing and analysis
performed by other parties, such as the valve manufacturers. Valve manufacturers perform extensive analyses and
tests of their products and, because they seek to sell those products, have a strong incentive to provide their customers
(the trailer manufacturers) with information that the trailer manufacturer can use to certify the vehicle to the
applicable standards. For example, Bendix currently provides this type of information to vehicle manufacturers
regarding Bendix's new valve for the new pressure control requirements. Based on the above considerations, NHTSA
believes that a trailer manufacturer can certify compliance with the control pressure differential amendments
without facing an unreasonable cost burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reexamining this matter in response to Mr. Crail's petition, NHTSA reaffirms its conclusion that the new control
line pressure balance requirements will result in relatively small costs for trailer manufacturers. The agency
also believes that its conclusions in the final rule are appropriate. Accordingly, the petitioner's request to reconsider
the amendment to Standard No. 121 is denied.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 4 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was prepared by the New England Fishery Management
Council (Council) in consultation with the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils, under
the provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A notice of availability for the proposed Amendment was published on August 10, 1993, (58 FR 42522) and a proposed
implementing rule was published on September 2, 1993, (58 FR 46606). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Approval of Amendment 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 4 was approved on November 5, 1993. However, concerns were raised about the potential for Amendment 4 to
cause excessive harvest of small sea scallops the first few years of implementation, if a supplemental average minimum
meat count measure were not included as a management measure in the Amendment. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
NOAA (AA), approved the Amendment, concurring with the Regional Director who stated that the issue of increased mortality
on small scallops in the early years of the program was considered by the Council during deliberations by the Plan Development
Team (where representatives of both the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and the NMFS Northeast Regional Office
participate), the Sea Scallop Oversight Committee, and the Council. The rebuilding schedule and effort reductions
in the Amendment are designed to strike a balance between an accelerated rate of recovery and the minimization of economic
and social disruption to the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Amendment was approved, NMFS remains concerned about the near-term level of protection of small sea
scallops. This concern is reflected in the Regional Director's approval letter to the Council, dated November 5,
1993, which advised the Council that the Regional Director will be carefully monitoring the initial impact of the
Amendment on fishing mortality rates of small sea scallops. If fishing mortality rates increase beyond anticipated
levels, the Council is expected to implement immediately adjustments under the framework measures of the Amendment
to protect sea scallop stocks adequately.

Overfishing Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 4 includes a definition of overfishing and a determination that the sea scallop resource is overfished.
The preamble to the proposed rule included the definition of overfishing. It is not repeated here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce fishing mortality below the overfishing definition threshold, the Council will reduce fishing effort
by approximately 40 percent over seven years. Because the impact of effort controls and gear restrictions on the resource
is uncertain, the Council estimates that actual effort reduction needed could be as low as 35 percent or as high as 70
percent.

Approved Vessel Tracking System (VTS) Vendors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule for Amendment 4, NMFS requested that vendors interested in having their VTS certified for use
in this fishery submit information showing that the VTS meets the specifications contained in the proposed rule.
NMFS has reviewed the information submitted by several vendors and will make available to interested parties the
names and addresses of those vendors who appear to meet the specifications. The opportunity remains open for interested
parties to submit their information to the NMFS and to be added to the list of approved vendors if it appears to the NMFS
that they can meet the specifications. It is not the intent of the NMFS to assure that the acquisition and installation
of a VTS unit from any one of these vendors meets the requirement of this rule as specified at &sect;650.25. Vessel owners
must demonstrate that the system purchased, from the list of approved vendors, is capable of meeting the operational
requirements of the regulations by providing information on vessel position and vessel status. It is the intent of
the NMFS that until the vessel owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that the VTS unit
is fully operational and is providing the required information to the NMFS, the vessel owner/operator will not be
eligible to receive a permit unless the Regional Director authorizes the use of a call-in system in accordance with
&sect;650.26(a)(3).

Effective Date of Management Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific management measures that will be used to achieve the necessary reduction in fishing effort include the
following: A moratorium on most new entrants into the scallop fishery; allocations of days-at-sea (DAS) that vessels
may fish for scallops based on three vessel groups (Full-time, Part-time, and Occasional); a requirement to purchase
and install a VTS unit for Full-time and Part-time vessels and a call-in system for Occasional vessels to monitor DAS;
permits for vessel operators and dealers; an open access scallop permit for vessels landing no more than 400 pounds
(181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or no more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops per trip; limitations
on upgrading of vessel size and engine horsepower; a prohibition on acquiring more than a 5 percent ownership interest
in the total number of limited access scallop vessels; mandatory reporting for permitted vessels and dealers; crew-size
limits; maximum dredge and trawl sweep size restrictions; minimum ring and mesh size restrictions; framework measures
to adjust the effort control and other measures; a minimum shell height restriction; and an annual option for vessels
in the Part-time or Occasional category to fish in the next higher vessel group if they use only one dredge no more than
10.5 feet (3.2 m) in width and their crew complement (including the operator) is five or less. The preamble to the proposed
rule described the management measures and their rationale, which are not repeated here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is implementing the measures in the Amendment and proposed rule as of March 1, 1994, in order to provide opportunity
for the industry to convert to 31/4 inch rings and acquire and install VTS units; and because of the administrative
burden imposed on the NMFS by these collective measures, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
implementation of a VTS; the need to issue thousands of new permits for operators, dealers and vessels; the need to
establish an appeal process for vessel owners who feel their DAS allocation is in error and/or for vessels that do not
qualify; and the need to establish details of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements required under &sect;650.7
and the DAS monitoring set forth in &sect;650.25. While the VTS is being put in place and the initial problems with that
new system are being worked out, a call-in procedure will be used to implement the DAS allocations. Existing regulations,
including the meat count measure, will remain in effect until March 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 1, 1994, the effective date of these regulations, all scallop vessel owners and operators and all scallop
dealers must have an appropriate permit, as specified under &sect;&sect;650.4, 650.5, and 650.6 in order to participate
in the fishery. In order to ensure being issued a permit, if eligible, by that date all owners, operators, and dealers
should apply for a permit as soon as possible. Application forms are available now and NMFS will attempt to mail such
forms to all known scallop vessel owners and operators and scallop dealers as soon as possible. Applications will
be processed as received. Early application, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 one filed before February 1, 1994, will help assure that the permit is issued by March 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in &sect;650.26(a)(3), until any VTS vendor is approved and the system is available, all permitted vessels
fishing under the DAS program must comply with the call-in notification provisions of &sect;650.26(b).

Comments and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS received comments on the proposed rule from one member of the Congress of the United States, five fishing industry
associations, and eight individuals. All of the comments were carefully considered during the formulation of the
final rule. Specific comments are discussed and responded to below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A member of Congress of the United States and an individual opposed the allocation of DAS because it takes Virginia,
North Carolina, and New Jersey fishermen longer to reach their fishing grounds than it takes New England fishermen.
These individuals offered days fished or a total allowable catch as an alternative. The commenters stated that the
DAS rule gives a distinct advantage to one area over another, whereas, days fished provides a level playing field for
all scallopers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council analyzed the days fished system before deciding on the DAS program, using the NMFS weighout database,
and determined that DAS is a fair reflection of a vessel's historical time at sea because it takes into consideration
the number of days a vessel spent traveling to and from the fishing grounds. The Council also determined the database
could not accurately show actual days fishing. However, the final rule includes a measure that would allow the adoption
of a days-fished system through a regulatory amendment, if data become available to support such a system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Act requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to follow a mandated time schedule for approval of
a plan amendment once it has been submitted by a Fishery Management Council. On July 30, 1993, the New England Fishery
Management Council submitted its plan amendment to NMFS, thereby triggering under the Magnuson Act the 95-day time
period in which the Secretary must approve or disapprove the amendment. Because of this limited time frame to consider
and respond to public comment and prepare the final rule for publication, NMFS allows for 45 days of public comment.
NMFS believes the 45 days given for comment are adequate.

 Due to the projected initial volume of applications for Operator permits required under Amendment 4, the NMFS needs
the flexibility to take 30 days to process and mail permits. However, NMFS will make every effort to process permits
sooner. NMFS will make available permit applications well in advance of March 1, 1994, in order to maximize the likelihood
that all participants in the scallop fishery will have the ability to obtain a permit before March 1, 1994.

 The sections have been rewritten and now require that within 15 days after a change in the application information,
a written report of the change be submitted and received by the Regional Director. Requiring all changes to be sent
by registered or certified mail would be too burdensome. Nevertheless, permit holders could choose to send the notice
of change by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, if they want to verify that timely notification
occurred.

 Requiring double links between rings throughout the entire dredge is necessary to insure the escapement of small
sea scallops in order to mitigate the impact of removing the meat-count-age-of-entry requirement. The NMFS recognizes
that this may require some change in industry practices but considers these measures to be necessary to the overall
success of the management program.

 The transfer prohibition reflects the Council intent to control and equalize the amount of fishing pressure associated
with allocated DAS. From an enforcement perspective, the prohibition is considered critical because it would be
difficult to detect violations unless all transfers are prohibited.

 A high level of monitoring is required to ensure the effectiveness of the management program and to avoid imposing
more restrictive measures than necessary on the industry because of insufficient data. This provision gives the
Regional Director the discretion to require a vessel to carry an observer to enhance data collection, if necessary.
In most cases where observer coverage is considered necessary, the Regional Director will first attempt to enlist
voluntary participation. Observers would be provided through existing NMFS observer programs. The vessel would
not have to pay the salary for the observer but would have to provide adequate accommodations and food. Neither NMFS
nor the government is responsible for providing insurance coverage for the observer; each vessel should provide
appropriate coverage.

 Most scallop dredge vessels currently have their crew members shuck scallop meats by hand while at sea. The amount
and size of scallops selected for shucking is a function of the crew size and the catch rates. The crew size restriction
reflects the Council's intention to cap the fishing power of these vessels at sea by limiting their processing (shucking)
capacity. Currently, the average crew size on sea scallop vessels is nine; in the past, crew sizes were larger but this
was a reflection of the condition of the resource. NMFS is not aware of any data or information indicating that the limitation
on crew size will affect safety at sea.

 This requirement complies with the Magnuson Act for establishing a system for limited access to a fishery. If a system
for limiting access to a fishery is included in a plan, the Magnuson Act requires the Council and the Secretary to ``take
into account'' such factors as present participation in the fishery, historical fishing practices and dependence
on the fishery, and capability of vessels to be used in other fisheries. The Council and NMFS considered all of these
factors in establishing criteria required to qualify for full participation in the scallop fishery. A control date
was announced on March 2, 1989, which gave notice to participants and potential participants of the fact that future
participation in the fishery may be limited for vessels that entered the fishery after the control date.

The purpose of the control date was to discourage speculative entry into the fishery while development of Amendment
4 progressed. In deciding to add the requirement that a vessel must have landed more than 400 pounds of scallops on at
least one trip in 1988&hyph;1989 in order to be eligible to participate in the fishery, the Council was addressing
the factor of historical fishing practices and dependence on the fishery. Later in its deliberations, the Council
recognized that not all participants may have received timely notice of the control date and, therefore, allowed
a limited exception for vessels purchased after the control date if the vessels had any participation in the fishery
between 1982 and 1990. With respect to determining allocations of DAS, the Council expanded historical participation
to include 1985&hyph;1990 in order to recognize longstanding historical dependence on the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule also adopts a Council recommendation to establish an exemption to the limited access fishery for vessels
that land less than 400 pounds of scallops per day, in order to provide some opportunity for small-scale operations
and new entrants to participate in the scallop fishery. Therefore, the Council's and NMFS's decision to rely on the
criteria contained in the final rule represents a balancing of present and historical participation in the fishery
with the need to reduce fishing mortality by limiting the number of full-time participants in the fishery.

 This requirement is necessary to provide protection for small scallops and to help control the amount of fishing mortality
associated with a DAS. This measure is designed to help mitigate the impact of removal of the meat count which provides
age-at-entry controls. It is not expected, however, to afford age-at-entry protection equal to the current meat
count system.

 NMFS contacted William D. DuPaul, Ph.D., of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, principal investigator on
the experimental study, regarding the comments received. He commented that the first fishing trip of the experiment
had recently been completed by a commercial vessel out of the port of New Bedford and that the larger rings allowed for
significantly more escapement than the 3-inch rings currently in use by the industry. DuPaul also commented that
the study is ongoing and that it is too early to draw any conclusions from the one trip taken. Final results on the experiment
are not expected until work is completed in late winter of 1994. Therefore, NMFS has not considered the preliminary
results of the ongoing experiment for the purposes of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the best scientific information available at this time, however, there seems to be a correlation between
ring size and size of scallops retained by scallop dredges. Because removing the meat count measure effectively removes
all age-at-entry controls, the Council and NMFS have determined that implementation of minimum ring size requirements
simultaneously with removal of the meat count measure is critical to the achievement of the amendment's objectives.
Failure to provide some age-at-entry limitations could seriously jeopardize the ability of the management measures
to achieve plan objectives in the time required.

 National Standard 5, 16 U.S.C. 1851(a)(5), states that conservation and management measures, where practicable,
should promote efficiency. This standard also provides, however, that the goals of efficiency may be balanced against
other factors such as social and biologic. In its deliberations, the Council explicitly considered possible gains
in efficiency in allowing DAS to be combined, but ultimately rejected such a measure because of socioeconomic concerns
of preserving current fishing practices and traditions at the outset of the management program. The Council was concerned
that allowing combination or transfer of DAS allocations, at this time, may precipitously lead to aggregation of
fishing rights in the hands of a few, thereby challenging the current type of fishing operations associated with the
northeast region. Moreover, it would be impracticable to allow such fishing rights to be transferred, at this time,
before the effectiveness of the management measures could be assessed. The Council did provide, however, that measures
that may enhance efficiency can be considered and adopted through the framework procedure specified in the rule.
NMFS concurs in the Council's deliberations and conclusions concerning these measures.

 The rule does not pre-determine whether the moratorium will be lifted. The rule provides only that the Council may
consider such a measure. If and when the Council considers such a measure, the plan requires that it be subject to public
comment and that commenters have adequate opportunity to respond. If the Council decides to address this subject
under the framework specifications all interested parties will be contacted and will have the opportunity to comment.
The Council could adopt such measures only if it can be demonstrated that they are necessary to meet the goals and objectives
of the FMP, including socioeconomic goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to clarify that the appeal process under this paragraph applies only to limited access scallop permit denial.
The paragraph was further modified to add the phrase ``if the vessel has on board a letter of authorization from the
Regional Director'' to clarify the requirements that vessels fishing under appeal must carry on board the letter
issued under &sect;650.4(a)(9)(vi)(D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.4, paragraph (a)(9)(vi)(D) was modified to add the sentence, ``If the appeal is denied, The Regional
Director shall send a notice of denial to the vessel owner; the authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 days after receipt
of the notice of denial.'', to clarify how vessel owners will be notified in the event of a denial of the appeal of a limited
access scallop permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.5, paragraph (c) was modified to add the sentence, ``Further, such operators must agree as a condition
of this permit that if the permit is suspended or revoked pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, the operator cannot be on board
any fishing vessel issued a Federal Fisheries Permit or any vessel subject to Federal fishing regulations while the
vessel is at sea or engaged in offloading.'' This phrase was included under &sect;650.5(n) in the proposed rule and
is repeated in this section in the final rule to increase awareness of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.5, paragraph (n) was modified to add the phrase ``while the vessel is at sea or engaged in offloading'',
to allow vessel operators to conduct business activity on board a vessel when the vessel is not engaged in any type of
fishing activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;650.6, paragraph (g) was modified to add the phrase, ``or ownership changes,'' to clarify that the permit
does not transfer with the change in ownership of the business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(1) was modified to replace ``provide'' with ``mail'' to clarify the way in which the
reports will be submitted. The paragraph was further modified to contain the phrase, ``name and permit number of the
vessels from which fish are landed or received;'' and the sentence, ``If no fish is purchased during the week, a report
so stating must be submitted.'', to clarify reporting requirements for dealers and to be consistent with the reporting
requirements of other regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(2) was modified to read, ``Required data are the number of employees handling fishery
products by month. Reports for a given calendar year shall be submitted to: NMFS Statistics, 166 Water Street, Woods
Hole, MA 02543, and must be postmarked by February 10 of the following year.'' This change further details the requirements
for this reporting requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(5) was modified to add the following sentence, ``If no product was purchased during
a week, a report so stating must be submitted.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.9, paragraph (b)(1) was subdivided into paragraphs (i) and (ii). Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) was added in
order to clarify paragraph (b)(1)(i) by prohibiting more than one trip per calendar day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.9, paragraph (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(17), and (c)(4), the phrase ``Possess on board or'' was
added to clarify the prohibition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.9, the following changes were made to clarify the prohibitions. Paragraph (c) was subdivided into paragraphs
(c)(1) through (c)(7). Paragraph (d)(4) was changed to paragraph (d)(4)(i), and a new paragraph, (d)(4)(ii), was
added. Paragraphs (d)(10) through (d)(15) were redesignated as paragraphs (d)(11) through (d)(16), and a new paragraph
(d)(10) was added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.20, paragraph (a) was modified to add the phrase, ``that may be landed, or possessed at or after landing,''
in order to clarify that the minimum shell height size is not an at-sea measure. Parallel changes were made to sections
650.20(b) and 650.9(a)(1) to reflect this clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (a) was modified to add the phrase ``in possession of more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked
scallops or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell scallops, or fishing for scallops,'' to clarify that certain trawl
gear restrictions are also possession restrictions applicable to any vessel possessing more than 40 pounds of shucked
scallops or 5 bushels of in-shell scallops. Similar changes were made to &sect;650.21(a) (1)&hyph;(2) and &sect;650.9(b)(8).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (b) was modified by deleting the phrase ``holding a Federal sea scallop permit under &sect;650.4
and'' and adding the phrases ``of more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked scallops or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell
scallops'' and all vessels issued limited access scallop permits and fishing under the DAS allocation program,''
to clarify that the dredge restrictions apply to all dredge vessels in possession of more than 40 pounds of shucked
scallops or 5 bushels of in-shell scallops. In &sect;650.21, paragraphs (b) (1)&hyph;(3) were modified to add the
phrase ``in use by or in possession of such vessels'' to clarify that the dredge restrictions are possession restrictions
also. The corresponding prohibition sections to these restrictions, &sect;650.9, paragraphs (b) (11)&hyph;(15)
and &sect;650.9, paragraphs (c) (2)&hyph;(6), were changed accordingly to reflect these clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (b)(iii), the sentence, ``The ring size will be the average of the measurements of any
series of 20 consecutive rings.'' was deleted. This provision had been added by NMFS with the intent of facilitating
enforcement. However, upon further consideration, it was determined that allowing an average minimum ring size
would necessitate difficult and problematic measuring requirements and possibly would not be consistent with the
Council's intent that no rings should be less than 31/4 inches. NMFS is developing a standard measuring device and
procedures to determine minimum ring sizes and will publish a description of such device and procedures in the

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (e) was modified to add the phrase, ``in addition to or notwithstanding other restrictions
in this Part'' to clarify that vessels operating under the small dredge program are still subject to other restrictions
in &sect;650 unless modified by the special provisions of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.24, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) was expanded to clarify the process for counting days at sea under the call-in
system.

In &sect;650.24, paragraph (f)(6) was modified to add the phrase ``if the vessel has on board an authorizing letter
from the Regional Director''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.25, paragraph (b) was modified to cross reference correctly the call-in procedures described in &sect;650.26(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraph (a) was modified to correctly cross reference the small dredge program in &sect;650.21(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) were modified to indicate that the Regional Director is to be notified
``through the VTS''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraph (a)(3) was modified to add the phrase ``or not functional''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraph (b) was modified to add language that is more specific regarding the call-in notification
requirements of the vessel owner or authorized representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4), the requirement that vessel owners or their authorized representative
call-in 2 hours prior to leaving port and within 1 hour of returning to port was replaced with the provision that the
DAS will begin and end upon receipt of the call. The Regional Director has determined that this less restrictive requirement
is supportable by current technology without compromising the enforceability of this measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.40, paragraph (c), the phrase ``After considering the PDT's findings and recommendations, or at any
other time,'' was added in order to clarify the Council's procedures when it is considering changes in management
measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.40, paragraph (e)(3), the sentence ``The Council may reconsider its prior action and recommend a new
action under paragraph (d) of this section.'' was deleted because it is considered to be unnecessary.

The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) determined that the FMP amendment that this rule would implement is consistent
with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making
that determination, has taken into account the information, views, and comments received during the comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council prepared a final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS) for Amendment 4, which was filed
by the Environmental Protection Agency with the Office of the Federal Register. The Environmental Protection Agency
has recommended that the National Marine Fisheries Service conduct studies in the near future to monitor the effect
of scallop dredges on bottom habitat. The AA has determined that the preferred alternative of Amendment 4 versus the
status quo is environmentally preferable upon review of the FSEIS and public comments. The FSEIS demonstrates that
the preferred alternative contains management measures to rebuild the stock of Atlantic sea scallops, provides
positive economic and social benefits to the fishing industry in the long term, and provides balance in the ecosystem
in terms of the sea scallop resource.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule may have significant effects on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. For the purposes of the RFA, the RIR is retitled as a
RIR/regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). According to the RIR/RFA prepared by the Council, the management measures
will have some negative impact on small entities. There are approximately 400&hyph;600 vessels that rely on scallops
for a portion of their revenue. All are considered small entities. Of these, more than 150 vessels would not qualify
for the vessel moratorium and may have to redirect effort into other fisheries. Approximately 63 percent of the 150
vessels, however, depend on sea scallops for 15 percent or less of their total revenue and may be able to compensate
by participating in the general scallop fishery (no moratorium, landings up to 400 pounds (181.44 kg) per trip). For
those vessels qualifying for the limited access fishery, there are significant short-term losses in revenue that
are offset by long-term gains.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule contains eight new collection-of-information requirements and also revises four existing requirements
previously approved by OMB under Control Numbers 0648&hyph;0202 and 0648&hyph;0229 and 0648&hyph;0018. These
collection-of-information requirements have been approved by OMB. Nevertheless, public comments are invited

as of the date the vessel it is replacing was initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified on a
valid application for a permit under this section; except that, the horsepower of the replacement vessel may not exceed
the horsepower of the vessel being replaced if the horsepower of the vessel being replaced has been increased through
upgrade or vessel replacement from that specified when the vessel being replaced initially applied for a 1994 limited
access scallop permit; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The replacement vessel's length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage may not exceed by more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage of the vessel being replaced, based on specifications
provided in the initial 1994 application for a limited access scallop permit; except that, the length, gross registered
tonnage, and net tonnage of the replacement vessel may not exceed the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage
of the vessel initially issued a limited access scallop permit if any or all of these specifications have been increased
through upgrade or vessel replacement from that specified when the vessel being replaced initially applied for a
1994 limited access scallop permit. For purposes of this paragraph, a vessel not required to be documented under Title
46, U.S.C. will be considered to be 5 gross registered tons. For undocumented vessels, net tonnage does not apply.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upgraded vessel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To remain eligible to retain a valid limited access scallop permit, or to apply for, or renew a limited access scallop
permit, a vessel may be upgraded, whether through refitting or replacement, only if the upgrade complies with the
following limitations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The vessel's horsepower may be increased, whether through refitting or replacement, only once. Such an increase
may not exceed 20 percent of the horsepower of the vessel initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified
in that vessel's permit application for a 1994 limited access scallop permit; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The vessel's length, gross registered tonnage and net tonnage may be upgraded, whether through refitting or
replacement, only once. Such an increase shall not exceed 10 percent each of the length, gross registered tonnage,
and net tonnage of the vessel initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified in that vessel's application
for a 1994 limited access scallop permit. This limitation allows only one upgrade, at which time any or all three specifications
of vessel size may be increased. This type of upgrade may be done separately from an engine horsepower upgrade.

Compliance with the specified shell-height standards will be determined by inspection and enforcement at or after
landing, including, the time when the scallops are received or possessed by a dealer or person acting in the capacity
of a dealer, as follows: the authorized officer will take samples of forty scallops each at random from the total amount
of scallops in possession. The person in possession of the scallops may request that as many as ten samples (400 scallops)
be examined as a sample group. A sample group fails to comply with the standard if more than ten percent of all scallops
sampled are less than the shell height specified by the standard. The shell height shall be measured in a straight line
from the hinge of the scallop to the outermost part of the curve on the leading edge. The total amount of scallops in possession
will be deemed in violation of this regulation and subject to forfeiture if the sample group fails to comply with the
standard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A vessel's average number of days of directed scallop fishing for purposes of assigning the vessel to one of the categories
specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined by applying one of the following formulas to the data,
information, or other credible evidence available to the Regional Director. Scallop DAS for this purpose is defined
as the total days at sea on trips with landings of more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels
(17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The following formulas apply to all vessels qualifying for limited access scallop permits, with the exception
of vessels that qualify under paragraph &sect;650.4(a)(1)(i)(C). The DAS formula applicable to that group of vessels
is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Vessel owners may choose their 1990 history under paragraph (b)(1)(i)
of this section, or a calculation based on the 1985&hyph;1990 history, as applicable, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)
of this section. DAS are calculated from the formulas below and the result is applied to the DAS categories described
in paragraph (a) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1990 fishing history. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For any vessel that fished for scallops in 1990, the number of scallop DAS may be determined by calculating the total
number of DAS on scallop trips ending in 1990; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For vessels with history in the scallop fishery between 1985 and 1990, inclusive, the number of years history is determined
as follows. With the exception of the adjustments specified under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this
section, vessels whose calculated scallop history is based on a formula below must use their entire history in the
scallop fishery and may not elect to use a formula based on fewer years history in the fishery.

Pro-ration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a limited access vessel entered the scallop fishery for the first time during the relevant time period, the first
year shall be pro-rated to a full year by pro-rating on an annual basis the number of DAS the vessel actually incurred
on trips landing more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell
scallops to determine the number of days at sea the vessel would have incurred had the vessel been in the fishery for
the full year. The pro-ration formula is as follows: The total number of scallop DAS in that year is divided by the percentage
of the year the vessel was in the fishery (by month). In pro-rating the days for such vessels, the Regional Director
shall take into account the date the vessel entered the fishery, the vessel's subsequent fishing history, and other
relevant information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vessel owners who purchased their vessel during the 1985&hyph;1990 time period may request that the DAS formulas
be based solely on their individual history in the scallop fishery, excluding all previous owner's scallop histories.
Under this option a vessel's first year in the fishery may be pro-rated based on the criteria specified in paragraph
(b)(1)(iii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For vessels qualifying for a limited access scallop permit under paragraph &sect;650.4(a)(1)(i)(C), pro-rate
to a full year the total number of DAS for trips the vessel would have fished and landed over 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of
shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops in 1990 based on the actual number of DAS
the vessel did fish in 1990 and the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Then, calculate the
average number of DAS for trips landing more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels
(17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops for the years 1991 and 1992. The number of days to determine the category shall be the
lower number between the pro-rated 1990 days and the average of DAS in 1991 and 1992.

for which it qualifies. A vessel whose owner/operator has declared it out of the scallop fishery pursuant to the provisions
of &sect;650.26, or has used up its allocated DAS, may leave port without being assessed a DAS as long as it does not possess
or land more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.61 hl) of in-shell scallops and complies

DAS shall accrue in hourly increments, with all partial hours counted as full hours. A DAS is calculated beginning
when a vessel leaves port and ending when the vessel returns to port as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) DAS for vessels that are under the VTS monitoring system described in &sect;650.26(a) are counted beginning with
the first hourly location signal received showing that the vessel crossed the COLREGS Demarcation Line leaving port
and ending with the first hourly location signal received showing that the vessel crossed the COLREGS Demarcation
Line upon its return to port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) DAS for vessels fishing under the call-in notification system described in &sect;650.26(b) are counted beginning

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A vessel, for which an appeal of its DAS category has been initiated, may fish under the DAS allocation allowed under
the next higher category than the vessel's initial category placement if the vessel has on board a letter of authorization
from the Regional Director, regardless of what category the vessel is appealing to be placed in, and is subject to all
requirements applicable to such category of vessels unless otherwise exempted. That is, if a vessel was initially
placed in the Part-time category, that vessel may fish up to the maximum number of DAS allocated to Full-time vessels
until the Regional Director has made a final determination on the appeal. If a vessel is initially placed in the Occasional
category, that vessel may fish up to the DAS allocated to Part-time vessels, regardless of what category the Occasional
vessel is appealing to be placed in, until the Regional Director has made a final determination on the appeal. Any DAS
spent fishing for scallops shall be counted against the DAS allocation of the category that the vessel is ultimately
placed in. If, before this appeal is decided, a vessel exceeds the number of DAS it is finally allocated after appeal,
the excess DAS will be subtracted from the vessel's allocation of DAS in 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, shall not permit the input of false positions; furthermore, if a system uses satellites to determine position, satellite
selection should be automatic to provide an optimal fix and should not be capable of being manually overridden by any
person on board a fishing vessel or by the vessel owner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The VTS shall be fully automatic and operational at all times regardless of weather and environmental conditions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The VTS shall be capable of tracking vessels in all U.S. waters in the Atlantic Ocean from the shoreline of each
coastal state to a line 215 nautical miles offshore and shall provide position accuracy to within 400 meters (1,300
feet); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) The VTS shall provide accurate hourly position transmissions every day of the year. In addition, the VTS shall
allow polling of individual vessels or any set of vessels at any time and receive position reports in real time. For
the purposes of this specification, ``real time'' shall constitute data that reflect a delay of 15 minutes or less
between the displayed information and the vessel's actual position; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The VTS shall be capable of providing network message communications between the vessel and shore. The VTS shall
allow NMFS to initiate communications or data transfer at any time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The VTS vendor shall be capable of transmitting position data to a NMFS-designated computer system via a modem
at a minimum speed of 9600 baud. Transmission shall be in ASCII text in a file format acceptable to NMFS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The VTS shall be capable of providing vessel locations relative to international boundaries and fishery management
areas;

Failure of a VTS unit to transmit an hourly signal of a vessel's position shall be presumed to be a DAS, or fraction thereof,
for as long as the unit fails to transmit a signal. A preponderance of evidence that the failure to transmit was due to
an unavoidable malfunction or disruption of the transmission that occurred while the vessel was declared out of the
scallop fishery or was not at sea will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.

are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the management
measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures should be published as a final rule,
the Council must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time
to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected
industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures;

a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or additions to management measures, and if after reviewing
the Council's recommendation and supporting information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended management measures and determines that the recommended
management measures may be published as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraph (d) of this section,
the action will be published in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS issues this notice to implement a temporary adjustment of the meat count and shell height standards for the Atlantic
sea scallop fishery. Its purpose is to take into account the fact that at the end of the spawning season, the scallop
resource is dominated by small scallops. This action increases the average meat count standard to 33 meats per pound
(MPP) (33 meats per 0.45 kg) and the shell height standard to 311/16 inches (94 mm).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations at 50 CFR part 650 implementing the Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic sea scallops (FMP) authorize
the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to adjust temporarily the meat count/shell height standards
(standards) upon finding that specific criteria are met. These criteria, which appear at &sect;650.22(c), include
the finding that: (1) The objective of the FMP would be achieved more readily, or would be better served through an adjustment
of the standards; (2) the recommended alteration in the standards would not reduce expected catch over the following
year by more than 5 percent from that which would have been expected under the prevailing standard; (3) the recommended
standards for meat count and shell height are consistent with each other; and (4) 50 percent of the harvestable biomass
is at scallop sizes smaller than those consistent with the prevailing standards, and a temporary relaxation of the
standards would not jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery. Adjustments of the standards may remain in effect
for up to twelve months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the criteria, the Regional Director made a proposal to adjust the standards. In accordance
with the regulations, a public hearing was held during the December 9, 1993, New England Fishery Management Council
(Council) meeting and comments on this recommendation were solicited. Attendance at the public hearing was low;
only one State Director and one member of the industry commented. The comments were in support of the recommended adjustment.
No written comments were received on the recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

After consideration of the full record, including: (1) Comments from the public, (2) comments from the Council, (3)
new resource and assessment information, and (4) available information on the fishery and the industry, the Regional
Director has decided to adjust the standards to 33 MPP (0.45 kg) with a corresponding shell height standard of 311/16
inches (94 mm) for the period February 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This adjustment to the standards coincides with the end of the 10 percent spawning season adjustment approved under
Amendment 2 to the FMP (53 FR 23634). This action was also taken in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993, at the end of the spawning
season adjustment period. Survey information shows that abundance and recruitment values for the sea scallop resource
are down and that the resource is dominated by small scallops. This makes attaining an average MPP standard difficult
because of the scarcity of large scallops available for mixing. Vessel costs increase because additional time and
fuel must be spent in search of large scallops, discard mortality increases on small scallops, and landings decrease.
These factors conflict with the objectives of the FMP and, therefore, criterion 1 outlined above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action meets criterion 2 because it is not expected to reduce catch over the following year by more than 5 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3 states that the meat count and shell height standards will remain consistent with each other. Based on
analysis of historical survey data, the 33 MPP (0.45 kg) is consistent with a corresponding shell height standard
of 311/16 inches (94 mm), thereby, conforming with criterion 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 4 states that 50 percent of the harvestable biomass must be at sizes smaller than the prevailing standard
(30 MPP). Recent survey results show that 50 percent of the harvestable biomass consists of scallops smaller than
30 MPP. Thus this portion of criterion 4 is met. Criterion 4 also states that a temporary relaxation of the standards
must not jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery. Sea scallops have their first significant spawning at age
four. Age four sea scallops range from approximately 30 count to 50 count. The Regional Director recognizes that caution
must be exercised when recommending a temporary adjustment to the meat count standard within this range. It is unlikely,
however, that an adjustment of this magnitude, for a one month period, will jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This temporary adjustment will be effective February 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994. During this period, the
meat count standard will be 33 MPP (33 meats per 0.45 kg) and the shell height standard 311/16 inches (94 mm). After February
28, 1994, sea scallop FMP Amendment 4 will be effective, and the meat count will no longer be in use as a management measure.

 The Army Corps of Engineers is establishing a danger zone in the waters of an unnamed tributary of Foster Creek, a tributary
of the Cooper River. The danger zone generally borders the Charleston Naval Base and the Naval Weapons Station, Charleston
and Berkeley Counties, South Carolina. The danger zone is needed to protect the public from the dangers associated
with the possibility of an errant round from an existing pistol range impacting in the unnamed creek. In addition to
these regulations, the Navy has received authorization from the Charleston District Engineer to erect a fence and
a gate across the creek to control passage into the area. Although the area is not closed to the public on a full time basis,
the Commanding Officer, Naval Weapons Station, may close the area at any time and reopen the area when he/she determines
that such restrictions may be terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commanding Officer, Naval Weapons Station, Charleston, South Carolina, has requested that the Corps expand
the existing restricted areas by establishing a danger zone in the waters of the Cooper River and its tributaries pursuant
to its authorities in section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1917 (33 U.S.C. 1) and section XIX of the Army Appropriations
Act of 1919 (33 U.S.C. 3). The danger zone will generally border the Charleston Naval Base and Naval Weapons Station.
The danger zone is needed to provide a margin of safety for vessels operating in the unnamed creek which is a tributary
to Foster Creek by prohibiting their entry into the area when determined appropriate by the Commanding Officer of
the Naval Weapons Station. A firing range for pistol training exists on an upland area close to the waterway. Although
the weapons are not directed or intentionally fired into the waterway, an errant round from the pistol range could
impact into the water. Vessels shall also be prevented from entering the area by a fence and gate across the waterway.
Closure of the gate and prohibited entry by these regulations shall be as required by the Commanding Officer of the
Naval Weapons Station.

accordingly, we are publishing these regulations as final without change.

This rule is issued with respect to a military function of the Defense Department and accordingly, the provisions
of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. These rules have been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Public
Law 96&hyph;354), which requires the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses (i.e., small businesses and small
governmental jurisdictions). These regulations may have a minimal impact on individuals fishing in the area. However,
these regulations will not prohibit their entry into the area except on an intermittent basis as required for the Governments'
operations. The area is not known to support a commercial fishery and will not affect the food fishing industry. In
addition, there will be no fees or charges imposed by the base commander for registration or entry into the area. This
will not result in any increase in costs to those fishermen. Accordingly, the preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not warranted.

This action amends appendix D, part 91, of the Federal Aviation Regulations to accurately reflect the name of the new
Denver, Colorado, airport. The new Denver International Airport, scheduled to open in March 1994, will replace the
Denver Stapleton Airport. Appendix D, part 91, lists locations, including Denver, Colorado, where special operating
restrictions apply. This action will not affect any procedures or practices currently in place, but it is necessary
to correctly state the name of the new Denver airport.

Appendix D, part 91, lists airports/locations where special operating restrictions apply. Section 1 lists the locations
at which the requirements of &sect;91.215(b)(2) apply. (Aircraft operating within 30 nautical miles of an airport,
listed in Section 1, from the surface upward to 10,000 feet mean sea level must be equipped with a Mode C transponder.)
Section 3 lists the locations where fixed-wing special visual flight rule (SVFR) operations are prohibited. Both

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
State agencies that are responsible for administering the Food Stamp Program are required to operate the Food Stamp
Employment and Training (E&amp;T) program. To assist in the operation of their E&amp;T programs, the State agencies
receive a Federal E&amp;T grant, a portion of which is distributed on the basis of each State agency's performance
in serving the target population. This rule proposes to freeze the performance-based grants at the level the State
agencies received in Fiscal Year 1993, for two years from promulgation of this rule in final form. The Department is
proposing this action because of statutory amendments to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, made by the Food, Agriculture,
Conservation and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (December 13, 1991).

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 6(d)(4) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2015(d)(4)), State agencies are required
to operate the Food Stamp Employment and Training (E&amp;T) program. The purpose of the E&amp;T program is to place
able-bodied food stamp recipients in educational or work-related activities that will increase their chances of
obtaining regular employment, and thus, reduce their need for public assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food stamp recipients who are required to register for work as specified under section 6(d)(4) of the Food Stamp Act
are expected, if assigned, to participate in an E&amp;T component as a condition of eligibility for receiving food
stamps. Work registrants who refuse or fail to comply with an assigned E&amp;T activity or component are ineligible
to receive benefits for two months or until they comply with the assigned activity, whichever comes first.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Food Stamp Act provides State agencies flexibility in operating their E&amp;T programs. To meet the needs of their
work registrant populations, the State agencies have discretion in determining which components will be offered
to E&amp;T participants and in targeting services toward certain work registrants. However, to avoid fiscal sanction,
State agencies must meet performance standards specified under 7 CFR 273.7(o). In Fiscal Years (FYs) 1990 and 1991,
the State agencies were required to place at least 50 percent of their mandatory E&amp;T participants into E&amp;T
components. In FY 1992 performance standards were lowered to 10 percent in response to section 907(b) of Public Law
102&hyph;237. For the purpose of determining each State agency's performance level, a person is considered ``placed''
in a component each time they begin a component or fail to comply with an assigned activity and are sent a Notice of Adverse
Action (NOAA). The performance formula also includes participants who are exempt from work registration but elect
to participate in the E&amp;T program (i.e., volunteers). State agencies may, but are not required to, serve volunteers.

Federal Funding for E&amp;T Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 16(h), 7 U.S.C. 2025(h) of the Food Stamp Act authorizes the Secretary to distribute $75 million each year
in unmatched Federal funds to State agencies to operate their E&amp;T programs. The State agencies may also receive
Federal matching funds for administrative costs above the initial Federal E&amp;T grant. The Federal and State governments
equally share the costs for transportation or dependent care reimbursements that are provided to E&amp;T participants.
Currently, participants must receive monthly reimbursements of up to $25 for transportation and other expenses
related E&amp;T to E&amp;T participation. Public Law 103&hyph;66 removes the monthly cap on dependent care expenses
effective September 1, 1994. Participants may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred, not to exceed the applicable
local market rate for the services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As specified under section 16(h)(1)(C) of the Food Stamp Act, $60 million of the Federal E&amp;T grant_the nonperformance
based portion_is distributed on the basis of each State agency's work registrant population as a percent of the total
work registrant population nationwide. Pursuant to Section 16(h)(1)(B), the remaining $15 million of the Federal
E&amp;T grant must be distributed on the basis of State agency performance. The Food Stamp Act does not address the
methodology for distributing performance-based funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department published final rules on June 9, 1989 (54 FR 24664) that specify how these funds are distributed. Under
7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(i)(B), performance-based E&amp;T funds are distributed on the basis of the number of people placed
into E&amp;T components. A person is considered placed for the purpose of distributing performance-based funds
if the person is required to work register and (1) begins an E&amp;T component; or (2) fails to comply with the E&amp;T
requirement and is sent a Notice of Adverse Action (NOAA) by the State agency. Volunteers are not included in the calculations
for distributing performance-based funds. To be eligible to receive performance-based funds, the State agency
must meet the performance standard as set forth under 7 CFR 273.7(o).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The current method for distributing the $15 million performance-based funds encourages State agencies to serve
large numbers of work registrants (i.e., broad-based) with low cost components such as job search and job search training.
When implementing the E&amp;T program in FY 1987, the Department encouraged broad-based programs because existing
research indicated that they had a positive impact on a participant's future chances of obtaining employment or ending
his or her dependence on public assistance. Given these results, the Department believed the possible benefits participants
should be shared by as many participants as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since implementation of the E&amp;T program in 1987, several things have shifted the focus of the program away from
the broad-based perspective. One was the implementation of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS)
program for non-exempt recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). With a combination of matching
Federal funds of up to $1 billion annually, State agencies must offer a number of mandatory and voluntary components
that are generally more intensive than those offered by the Food Stamp E&amp;T program. By October 1992 JOBS had to
be implemented statewide throughout the country. Several State agencies have sought to make the two programs more
similar. A number have started directing their E&amp;T funds toward a more targeted population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results of studies assessing the effectiveness of broad-based work programs have been published in recent years,
including the Department's evaluation of the E&amp;T program (See ``Evaluation of the Food Stamp Employment and
Training Program, Final Report,'' Abt Associates, June 1990). This study concluded that the broad-based E&amp;T
program in operation in FY 1988 did not have a significant effect on a participant's ability to find work or increase
work hours or earnings. Without a positive effect on employment and earnings, the study further concluded that participation
in the E&amp;T program did not significantly reduce a person's need for food stamp benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these circumstances, Congress made certain amendments to the E&amp;T provisions of the Food Stamp Act
that allow, or even encourage, the State agencies to provide more intensive services towards a targeted population.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One amendment in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435, 102 Stat. 1645, September 19, 1988), mandated
that the Department implement outcome-based standards in place of the current process-based (i.e., placements)
system. As specified under Public Law 100&hyph;435, outcome-based standards would measure job placement rates,
wage rates, job retention rates, households ceasing to need food stamp benefits, improved education levels and the
extent to which persons volunteer for E&amp;T services. Public Law 100&hyph;435 also required that the outcome-based
standards encourage State agencies to serve participants with barriers to employment (e.g., illiteracy or long-term
food stamp dependency). Therefore, the E&amp;T provisions under Public Law 100&hyph;435 reflect Congress' concern
that, to be successful, Federal work programs must apply resources towards disadvantaged populations with barriers
to employment and that performance must be measured in terms of successful outcomes rather than placements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was required under Public Law 100&hyph;435 to implement outcome-based performance standards by
April 1, 1991. The implementation date was later amended to October 1, 1991 through the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic
Hunger Relief Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, 104 Stat. 3359, November 28, 1990). This date was changed again by the Food,
Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;237, 105 Stat. 1818, December 13, 1991).
Under section 907(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;237, outcome-based performance standards must be implemented no later
than one year after the DHHS publishes final outcome-based performance standards for its JOBS program. This delay
will allow the Department of Agriculture and the DHHS to coordinate outcome-based performance standards for the
two programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim period before outcome-based performance standards are implemented, section 907(b) of Public Law
102&hyph;237 reduced the annual performance standard for States from 50 percent to no more than 10 percent in FYs 1992
and 1993. The provisions show clear Congressional intent that the State agencies no longer be held to a standard requiring
service to a large number of participants. Rather, under Public Law 102&hyph;237, the State agencies must be provided
the flexibility to target a smaller population with more intensive components. State agencies are not required to
implement a more intensive E&amp;T program and may continue to operate broad-based programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 907(b) of Public Law 102&hyph;237 was effective on September 30, 1991. On February 12, 1992, the Department
notified State agencies in writing of the reduction in performance standards for FY 1992. The Department will publish
a rule implementing the revised performance standards in the near future.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The amendments made under Public Law 102&hyph;237 support efforts to target the E&amp;T program towards fewer, harder
to employ participants or to offer more intensive components to a smaller segment of the food stamp population. Given
these amendments, the Department believes it must suspend the current method for distributing the $15 million performance-based
funds and, in its place, implement a method which will not penalize State agencies that place fewer participants and/or
operate more intensive components. If the current method for distributing performance funds is left unchanged,
State agencies that elect to target fewer participants will lose performance-based funding. Thus, the current method
for distributing funds is a barrier to the State agencies' implementation of amendments made by Public Law 102&hyph;237.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered numerous options for revising the methodology for distributing performance-based funds.
All options were viewed with two purposes in mind_to remove barriers for those State agencies that wish to target their
E&amp;T programs and to reward State agencies equitably for their performance. After careful consideration of these
options, the Department is proposing in this rule to freeze performance-based funds at the levels the State agencies
received in FY 1993. This rule proposes that the freeze of performance-based funding remain in effect for two years
from the date of promulgation of this rule in final form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 12, 1992, the Department notified State agencies in writing of the freeze of performance-based funding
to the FY 1993 level. FY 1994 performance-based funds were distributed based on this methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes there are several advantages for freezing performance-based funds. First, the proposed
freeze does not prohibit State agencies from either modifying their E&amp;T program to target smaller populations
or retaining the current broad-based program. Therefore, this proposal would provide the State agencies with the
flexibility to move their E&amp;T programs in the direction they believe is most appropriate for their work registrant
population. However, no State agency would be penalized for meeting the lower standard. Second, the State agencies
would know the amount of their performance-based funding levels for the foreseeable future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching its decision to propose a freeze on performance-based funds, the Department considered numerous other
options. These included: (1) Distributing the funds on the basis that is currently used for distributing the $60 million
nonperformance-based funds (i.e., work registrant population); (2) rewarding performance on the basis of how many
participants complete a component or leave a component to take a job; (3) modifying the current definition of a ``placement''
(e.g., include volunteers and/or exclude NOAA's); and (4) providing extra credit to State agencies that target hard-to-employ
populations (e.g., allow credit only for service to certain hard-to-employ groups such as long-term recipients
of food stamp benefits or individuals who have not completed high school). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though each of these options has merit, the Department rejected the options in favor of a freeze. The option for
distributing the $75 million Federal E&amp;T grant on the basis of each State agency's work registrant population
was rejected because it would not distribute the $15 million E&amp;T funds on the basis of performance, as required
by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second option, rewarding performance for completed E&amp;T components or job entries was rejected because it
would base performance on outcomes. Because section 907(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;237 specifically delays outcome-based
performance standards until coordination with the JOBS program can be achieved, the Department believes the option
would not be consistent with the law. The Department is also reluctant to implement changes to program areas which
will, in all likelihood, be changed again when the outcome-based performance standards are implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the third option, the Department would have redefined ``placements'' in calculating the success of a State
agency's performance. None of the possible redefinitions examined, however, would have resulted in moving away
from rewarding States with high numbers of placements over those with low numbers. Thus, all of the possible changes
would have penalized States that reduce the number of people served_contrary to the Congressional intent underlying
the amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The last option, providing extra credit to State agencies targeting populations with the greatest barriers to employment,
was rejected because of its administrative burdens. The option would have resulted in better targeting of hard-to-employ
populations, and thus, taken State agencies in the direction the program is heading. However, the Department is reluctant
to implement a major increase in reporting requirements for a relatively short period of time before outcome-based
performance standards are implemented. The Department further believes that the definition of hard-to-employ
populations should be coordinated with the JOBS program during development of outcome-based performance standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department is proposing to amend &sect;273.7(d)(1)(i)(B) in this rulemaking to specify that the
$15 million E&amp;T funds will be frozen at the levels the State agencies received in FY 1993. In accordance with current
rules, performance-based funds will be allocated by the ratio of the number of E&amp;T mandatories placed in an E&amp;T
program in an eligible State to the number of E&amp;T mandatories placed in all eligible States in Calendar Year 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule proposes that the FY 1993 levels be used for the two Fiscal Years following the year in which this rule is published
in final form. The Department is anxious to receive suggestions for ways the performance-based funds could be distributed
beyond that, until outcome-based performance standards are implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agencies must continue to meet established performance standards (i.e., 10 percent in FY 1994) to be eligible
for their share of these funds as is required under 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(i)(B). Should a State agency fail to meet the 10
percent performance standard in a given fiscal year, it would be ineligible to receive its share of performance-based
funding in the second following fiscal year. For instance, if a State agency fails to meet the 10 percent performance
standard in FY 1992, it would be ineligible to receive performance-based funding in FY 1994. Should this occur, the
Department is proposing in this rule to recalculate the performance-based funds to the State agencies on the basis
of Calendar Year 1991 data, but excluding the States which did not place at least 10 percent of their eligible population.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required under current rules, State agencies may not submit corrected FNS 583 reports any later than March 1 if they
are to be used in determining whether a State agency is eligible for performance-based funding.

State agency has met the performance standard as specified under paragraph (o) of this section for the second preceding
fiscal year. For example, to receive performance-based funding in Fiscal Year 1994, the State agency must have met
its performance standard in Fiscal Year 1992. Corrections to reports required to be submitted in accordance with
paragraph (c) of this section must be received by FNS, and State agency good cause appeals must be resolved no later
than March 1, to be used in determining whether a State agency is eligible for performance-based funding for the fiscal
year beginning the following October. In Fiscal Year 1994 and each subsequent fiscal year until two years after the
promulgation of this rule in final form, if the data on the reports show that a State agency did not meet its performance
standard or a good cause determination was not made by FNS by March 1, the State agency shall not be eligible for performance-based
funding. In this instance, the Secretary shall redistribute the $15 million Federal funds to eligible State agencies
on the basis of Calendar Year 1991 data as prescribed under this paragraph, excluding the noncompliant States.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend the amount of flood insurance coverage required of recipients of certain SBA assistance.
Under this proposal, flood insurance would be required in an amount equal to the lesser of the sum of all liens on the
property (including any SBA lien) plus, if the SBA assistance is unsecured, the outstanding balance of the SBA assistance
or the insurable value of the property, but in no event would the required insurance exceed the maximum flood insurance
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to May 10, 1983, a borrower under any of SBA's financial assistance programs was required to carry and maintain
flood insurance in the amount of the SBA loan balance, even if the insurable value of the collateral for the loan were
greater and higher amounts of flood insurance were available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended
(the ``NFI Act''). See 13 CFR 116.11(c) (1983). On May 10, 1983, SBA amended this regulation to require borrowers to
purchase the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFI Act, not to exceed the insurable value of the property.
48 FR 20933.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the amendment was to assure that the value of SBA's collateral would be protected from floods in flood
prone areas. SBA had realized that flood insurance in the amount of the SBA loan balance was inadequate protection
when SBA's interest in the collateral was junior to another lender. If, for example, a disaster loan applicant had
an existing mortgage on his property in favor of a commercial lender, SBA would assume a junior lienholder's position
as security for the disaster loan. If a subsequent flood disaster occurred and the borrower had been carrying flood
insurance only in the amount of the SBA loan, the insurance proceeds would be applied first to the commercial loan and
would be insufficient to repay SBA. The requirement of ``full insurable value'' insurance prevented this outcome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it also forced many borrowers to purchase insurance far in excess of the loan they would receive from the Agency.
Moreover, in the ten years since the adoption of the May 10, 1983 final rule, SBA has observed a number of loan application
cancellations as a result of the high cost of full insurable value insurance relative to the principal amount of the
SBA loan. In some of those cases, the cost of the insurance may have even approached or exceeded the amount of the SBA
assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA recognizes that full insurable value insurance confers a benefit on the borrower (protection for his equity in
the property), the Agency (reduction in the need for future disaster assistance), and the national flood insurance
fund (bolstering of the fund's reserves). Nevertheless, the benefit comes at an additional cost to the borrower at
a time when the borrower may be suffering significant economic distress from a flood disaster.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA has come to the conclusion that it can adequately protect its interest in the collateral or in the general credit
of the borrower without forcing the borrower to purchase full insurable value flood insurance. Without returning
to the pre-1983 rule, which placed SBA's interest in the collateral at risk if there were senior lienholders, SBA believes
it can improve the present rule to protect SBA's interest without unnecessarily burdening the borrower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because SBA's real interest in the collateral exists only to the extent of the outstanding balance of the loan, SBA
loans can be adequately protected even if insurance does not cover the full value of the collateral, so long as insurance
does cover the amount of all outstanding liens (including any SBA lien) on the property plus, in the event SBA's assistance
is unsecured, the outstanding balance of such assistance. Then, if a borrower were to suffer a subsequent flooding
loss and recover insurance proceeds, SBA would likely be reimbursed in full for the outstanding amount of its loan.
Of course, if that flooding were to cause damage in excess of all liens (plus the amount of SBA's loan if SBA were unsecured),
such ``excess'' damage would not be covered by insurance and would erode any equity the borrower might have had in the
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the issues discussed above, SBA has concluded that its flood insurance requirement should be amended.
Accordingly, SBA is hereby proposing to revise Section 116.11(c) to require that applicants for SBA financial assistance
who are located in a special flood hazard area obtain and maintain flood insurance in an amount equal to the lesser of:
(1) All outstanding liens (including SBA's lien) on the property plus, if the SBA assistance is unsecured, the outstanding
balance of the SBA assistance or (2) the insurable value of the property, but in no event would the required insurance
exceed the flood insurance available under the NFI Act. This provision applies to the following programs: 7(a) business
loans, 7(b) disaster loans, sections 501, 502 and 503 development company loans, lease guarantees, small business
investment companies and pollution control guarantees. (13 CFR 116.10 (1993))

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is expected that most of the time the insurable value of the collateral will exceed the amount of all liens on the property
(plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured). Thus, for most borrowers, the amount of flood insurance required would be
determined by the liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured) so long as flood insurance in that amount
were available under the NFI Act. On those occasions when the insurable value of the collateral dips below the liens
on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured), only enough insurance to protect the collateral would be required.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 12, 1987, Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc. (BRS), 9242 Hudson Boulevard, Lake Elmo, Minnesota 55042,
filed an application for a supplemental type certificate (STC) to install the GARD&hyph;150 parachute recovery
system on Cessna 150/A150 Series and 152/A152 Model Airplanes. Subsequently they received the STC under Special
Condition 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;33, dated November 17, 1987. The parachute recovery system is intended to recover an
airplane in emergency situations such as mid-air collision, loss of engine power, loss of airplane control, severe
structural failure, pilot disorientation, or pilot incapacitation with a passenger on board. The GARD&hyph;150
system, which is only used as a last resort, is intended to prevent serious injuries to the airplane occupants by parachuting
the airplane to the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BRS followed their STC on the Cessna 150/A150 and 152/A152 Series with a request for special conditions on a GARD system
that would be applicable to most general aviation airplanes. The nature of the parachute recovery system applies
to most general aviation airplanes instead of each airplane model needing separate special conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parachute recovery systems typically consist of a parachute packed in a canister mounted on the airframe. A solid
propellant rocket motor or compressed air may deploy the canopy and is usually located on the side of the canister.
A door positioned above the canister seals the canister, parachute canopy, and rocket motor from the elements and
provides free exit when the canopy is deployed. These systems are deployed by a mechanical pull handle mounted so that
the pilot and passenger can reach it. At least two separate and independent actions are required to deploy the system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A four-cable bridle attaches the canopy bridle to the airplane primary structure. The cable lengths are designed
to provide the best airplane touchdown attitude. The cables are routed externally and covered with small frangible
fairings from the fuselage exit holes to the attach points.The applicants must supplement the FAA-approved Flight
Manual as part of the STC. The supplement will describe the system, define the operating envelope with appropriate
warnings, and define required system maintenance and inspection information. A separate FAA approved Operating
Manual describing the previous items will be provided for those airplanes that do not have an FAA-approved Flight
Manual.Recommended placards should be located near the pull handle in clear view of the pilot to identify the system
and operating envelope, state deployment actions, and provide appropriate warnings. A warning placard should also
be located on the canister near the rocket motor.

Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The installation of parachute recovery systems in part 23 airplanes was not envisioned when the certification basis
for these airplanes was established. In addition, the Administrator has determined that current parts 21 and 23 do
not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for a parachute recovery system; therefore, this system is
considered a novel and unusual design feature.Special conditions may be issued and amended, as necessary, as part
of the type certification basis if the Administrator finds that the airworthiness standards designated in accordance
with &sect;21.101(b)(2) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards because of the novel and unusual
design features of the airplane modification. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with
&sect;11.49 after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), effective October 14, 1980, and
become part of the type certification basis, as provided by &sect;21.17(a)(2).Special conditions are proposed
for flight test demonstrations. These requirements would ensure that the parachute recovery system will perform
its intended function without exceeding its strength capabilities. These requirements would also require that
demonstrations be made to show that the parachute will deploy in various specified flight conditions.Special conditions
are proposed for the occupant restraint provisions where applicable. These requirements ensure that airplanes
modified with a parachute recovery system are equipped with a restraint system designed to protect the occupants
from injury during parachute deployment and ground impact.Special conditions are proposed for the parachute performance.
The requirements would ensure the following: (a) The parachute complies with the applicable section of TSO&hyph;C23c
(SAE AS8015A) at the critical airplane weights, (b) the parachute deployment loads do not exceed the structural strength
of the airplane, (c) the system will provide a ground impact that does not result in serious injury of the passengers,
and (d) the system will operate in adverse weather conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Special conditions are proposed for the functions and operations of the parachute recovery system. These requirements
would ensure the following: (a) There is no fire hazard associated with the system, (b) the system has adequate reliability,
(c) the sequence of arming and activating the system will prevent inadvertent deployment, (d) the system can be activated
from either the pilot's or the copilot's position by various sized people, (e) the system will be labeled to show its
identification function and operating limitations, and (f) if must be shown that the occupants will be protected
from serious injury after touchdown under various adverse weather conditions, including high winds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions are proposed for protection of the parachute recovery system. These requirements would ensure
that the system is protected from deterioration due to weathering, corrosion, abrasion, and other causes; and that
provisions are made to the parachute canister to provide adequate ventilation and drainage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions are proposed for a system inspection provision. These requirements would ensure that adequate
means are available to permit examination of the parachute recovery system components and that instructions for
continued airworthiness are provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions are proposed for the operating limitations of the parachute recovery system. These requirements
would ensure that the system operating limitations are prescribed for inspecting, repacking, and replacing the
system's parachute and deployment mechanism at approved intervals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has considered the features proposed by Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc., for the GARD installation in the
primary, normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes and has concluded that special conditions should be
proposed for such systems to provide the necessary level of safety.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Logistics Agency proposes to exempt an existing system of records, S255.01 DLA-GC, entitled Fraud and
Irregularities, from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The exemptions are intended to increase the value
of the system of records for law enforcement purposes, to comply with prohibitions against the disclosure of certain
kinds of information, and to protect the privacy of individuals identified in the system of records. The notice was
previously published on November 16, 1993, at 58 FR 60428.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof;
does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act

the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known
as the Privacy Act of 1974.

This proposed rule would add two exemptions to an existing DLA system of records. DLA performs as one of its principal
functions investigations into and enforcement actions concerned with violations of civil and administrative law,
fraud, or antitrust rules relating to DLA procurement, property disposal, contract administration, or other DLA
activities. The proposal to add the (k)(2) and (k)(5) exemptions reflects recognition that certain records in the
system may be deemed to require protection from disclosure in order to protect confidential sources mentioned in
the files and avoid compromising, impeding, or interfering with investigative and enforcement proceedings. The
system would thus be exempt from sections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (d)(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and
(f) as well as corresponding DLA and DoD Regulations. The Director proposes to adopt the exemptions for the above reasons.

Exemption:

This system of records is exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G),
(H), and (I), and (f).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From subsection (c)(3) because granting access to the accounting for each disclosure as required by the Privacy Act,
including the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure and the identity of the recipient, could alert the subject
to the existence of the investigation or prosecutive interest by DLA or other agencies. This could seriously compromise
case preparation by prematurely revealing its existence and nature; compromise or interfere with witnesses or make
witnesses reluctant to cooperate; and lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsections (d)(1) through (d)(4) and (f) because providing access to records of a civil investigation and the
right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to be made to the information contained therein would
seriously interfere with and thwart the orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation.
Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information
that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to
suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets
that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of each piece of information
in the early stages of an investigation. In some cases, it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other
evidence that its relevance and necessity will be clear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because there is no necessity for such publication since the system of records
will be exempt from the underlying duties to provide notification about and access to information in the system and
to make amendments to and corrections of the information in the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsection (e)(4)(I) because to the extent that this provision is construed to require more detailed disclosure
than the broad, generic information currently published in the system notice, an exemption from this provision is
necessary to protect the confidentiality of sources of information and to protect privacy and physical safety of
witnesses and informants. DLA will, nevertheless, continue to publish such a notice in broad generic terms as is its
current practice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Act of December 31, 1975 (the ``Act''), established the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (the ``HCNRA'')
``to assure that the natural beauty, and historical and archeological values of the Hells Canyon area *&blank;*&blank;*
are preserved for this and future generations, and that the recreational and ecologic values and public enjoyment
of the area are thereby enhanced.'' 89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the Act's overall thrust is to protect and enhance the identified resource values within the HCNRA, Congress
acknowledged in Section 13 of the Act that ``ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of
homes and lands associated therewith, as they exist on the date of enactment of this Act, are recognized as traditional
and valid uses of the recreation area.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCNRA covers 658,457 acres. Almost 95% of the HCNRA, or 625,193 acres, is in federal ownership. Within the HCNRA
is the Hells Canyon Wilderness, totalling 219,500 acres of National Forest System land, and a small section of the
Eagle Cap Wilderness, totalling 3,553 acres of National Forest System land. Also within the HCNRA are the Snake, Rapid,
and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers, the corridors of which include 33,767 acres of National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of the Act stipulates that the HCNRA shall be administered for public outdoor recreation in a manner compatible
with the following objectives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The maintenance and protection of the free-flowing nature of the rivers within the recreation area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Conservation of scenic, wilderness, cultural, scientific, and other values contributing to the public benefit;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Preservation, especially in the area generally known as Hells Canyon, of all features and peculiarities believed
to be biologically unique including, but not limited to, rare and endemic plant species, rare combinations of aquatic,
terrestrial, and atmospheric habitats, and the rare combinations of outstanding and diverse ecosystems and parts
of ecosystems associated therewith;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Protection and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Protection of archeological and paleontological sites and interpretation of these sites for the public benefit
and knowledge insofar as it is compatible with protection;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Preservation and restoration of historic sites associated with and typifying the economic and social history
of the region and the American West; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Such management, utilization, and disposal of natural resources on federally owned lands, including, but not
limited to, timber harvesting by selective cutting, mining, and grazing and the continuation of such existing uses
and developments as are compatible with the provisions of the Act.

Section 10 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to accomplish the purposes
of the Act. Section 10 expressly lists several subjects as possible topics for rulemaking, including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Standards and guidelines to insure the full protection and preservation of the historic, archeological, and
paleontological resources in the recreation area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provision for the control of the use of the use of motorized and mechanical equipment for transportation over,
or alteration of, the surface of any Federal land within the recreation area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provision for the control of the use and number of motorized and nonmotorized rivercraft: Provided, that the use
of such craft is hereby recognized as a valid use of the Snake River within the recreation area; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Standards for such management, utilization, and disposal of natural resources on federally owned lands, including,
but not limited to, timber harvesting by selective cutting, mining and grazing and the continuation of such existing
uses and developments as are compatible with the provisions of this Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10 also authorized rulemaking to establish standards for the use and development of privately owned property
in the HCNRA. This is the subject of a separate rulemaking and, thus, is not included in this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following enactment of the Act in 1975, the Forest Service construed Section 10's authority to promulgate regulations
as discretionary and that the issues identified therein could be adequately addressed under existing statutory
and regulatory authority. This interpretation was challenged in a 1988 lawsuit which contended that the regulatory
authority in Section 10 was mandatory, not discretionary.

dismissed the case. On appeal, however, the Ninth Circuit, reversed the district court and concluded that the regulations
were, in fact, required by Section 10. According to the Ninth Circuit, Section 10 ``compels the Secretary to promulgate
nonduplicative regulations of the sort described by subsections 10(a) through 10(e).''

 an interim rule establishing standards and guidelines for federal lands in the HCNRA had been adopted and public comment
solicited (54 FR 41089; Oct. 5, 1989). Only two comments were received on the interim rule. The interim rule has never
been published as a final rule. Due to the length of time that has passed since the issuance of the interim rule, and the
recognition that substantial modifications to the interim rule would be required, the agency has decided to issue
a new proposed rule for public comment. Accordingly, an agency response to the comments submitted on the 1989 interim
rule is not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ease of reference, the proposed rule divides the HCNRA into two categories_Wilderness Lands and Other Lands.
Consistent with Congress' recognition that the wilderness portions of the HCNRA should receive substantially more
protection than the rest of the HCNRA, some standards and guidelines are more protective in the Wilderness Lands category
than in the Other Lands category. In other instances, however, the standards and guidelines are the same.

Section-By-Section Explanation of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would established a new Subpart F of Part 292, Hells Canyon National Recreation Area_Public Lands,
in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A section-by-section explanation of the proposed rule follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 292.40&blank;Purpose and Scope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;292.40 explains that the purpose of this rule is to establish specific standards
and guidelines for the use of the National Forest System lands that comprise the Hells Canyon National Recreation
Area (HCNRA). The topics that are the subject of these standards and guidelines correspond with the topics in Section
10 of the Act, except for the use and development of privately owned property which, as previously noted, is the subject
of a separate rulemaking and not addressed herein. Paragraph (b) explains that, unless directly in conflict with
the standards and guidelines set forth in the rule, all of the existing authorities generally applicable to National
Forest System lands are specifically applicable to the National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. It also states that
the specific regulatory authority for the HCNRA embodied in the rule's standards and guidelines would prevail over
the Forest Service's general regulatory authority for National Forest System lands, if a conflict between the two
should arise.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;292.42 would establish several guiding principles that apply to the standards and guidelines called
for in Section 10 of the Act and set out in &sect;&sect;292.43 through 292.48. These principles include the recognition
that the rule is a supplement to, not a substitute for, existing regulatory authority; that uses or activities authorized
under the rule's standards and guidelines might require additional site-specific environmental analysis; that
programmatic direction in the Comprehensive Management Plan must conform to the standards and guidelines of the
rule; and, that the standards and guidelines for a given use or activity may vary depending on whether that use or activity
is located inside or outside the designated wilderness in the HCNRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;292.43 would create seven standards to guide Forest Service administration of cultural and paleontological
resources in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a) (1)&hyph;(4) set forth the standards and guidelines for cultural
and paleontological resources on the Other Lands in the HCNRA; proposed paragraphs (b) (1)&hyph;(3) set forth the
standards and guidelines for cultural and paleontological resources located on the Wilderness Lands in the HCNRA.
For ease of reference, ``cultural resources'' includes historic and archeological resources in the HCNRA. Though
not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the accompanying regulations at 36 CFR parts 296 and 800 would also apply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(1) would establish protection as the primary management objective for cultural resources in the HCNRA.
It would additionally provide for public education and information opportunities about cultural resources as a
management objective unless this would unreasonably interfere with protection efforts. This standard acknowledges
the importance of cultural resource protection and education for the vast storehouse of information in the HCNRA
but recognizes that educating the public about cultural resources must be secondary to protection and must occur
only if the resources can be adequately protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(2) requires that the Ranger establish management priorities for cultural resources based,
in part, on whether the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office has concurred with the Forest Service's determination
that a cultural resource is ``significant.'' By establishing priorities, the Ranger will be able to allocate available
moneys for protection, education, and enjoyment based on the historical or scientific importance of a cultural resource.
The Ranger also may take into account the relative risk of damage or destruction to the resource and steps that could
be taken to avoid or minimize that risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) would apply to cultural resources which meet the significance threshold. It would require that
information from these resources be documented and favor on-site over off-site protection. The Ranger may select
off-site protection under certain conditions. For instance, the Ranger may decide off-site protection is appropriate
if the resource is located on NRA Wilderness Lands and protecting it on-site would significantly intrude on the wilderness
resource. Another example of when off-site protection might be preferred is if the cost is less than on-site protection
and significant cultural resources with identical or similar values have already been protected on-site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(4) applies to all paleontological resources in the HCNRA and would establish protection
for scientific study as the primary objective. Prior written authorization would be required before any individual
could disturb or remove a paleontological resource in connection with scientific study activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1) would incorporate the standards and guidelines for Other Lands and apply them to the Wilderness
Lands. This would ensure consistency of Forest Service cultural and paleontological resource administration within
the HCNRA and, more importantly, the protection of these resources into the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) would establish two additional standards for Wilderness Lands in recognition of the Agency's
dual management objectives of protecting cultural resources and minimizing impacts on the wilderness. This would
be accomplished by requiring that information and education activities related to cultural resources on Wilderness
Lands be conducted outside of the wilderness and by precluding the development of new or relocated trails on Wilderness
Lands which would be used primarily as a means of securing public access to cultural resources. This will enable visitors
to experience cultural resources in their natural setting, unencumbered by the signs, guided tours, or other devices
normally used to inform and educate the visitor about our past.

Section 292.44&blank;The Use of Motorized and Mechanical Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;292.44 would create five standards to guide Forest Service administration of motorized and mechanical
equipment on National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(4) set forth the standards
and guidelines for motorized and mechanical equipment use in the Other Lands; proposed paragraph (b) would establish
the standard for such use in the Wilderness Lands. For ease of reference, the term ``motorized and mechanical equipment''
in this rule has the same meaning as ``motorized equipment'' and ``mechanical transport'' which are defined in regulations
promulgated under the Wilderness Act at 36 CFR part 293 except that it would not include motorized wheelchairs or other
devices used solely to assist people with disabilities. Nor would it include motorized or nonmotorized rivercraft
which are defined in and regulated under a separate provision of this rule. Though not explicitly referenced, the
relevant provisions of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and regulations at 36 CFR parts 212, 261, 293, and 295 would also apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) would authorize the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on any Forest Service roads or airfields
within the HCNRA subject to terms and conditions necessary to ensure the safe use of these facilities. This provision
applies to all Forest Service transportation development facilities as that term is currently defined in 36 CFR 212.1,
except for Forest Service trails which are the subject of paragraph (a)(2). This provision also does not purport to
regulate the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on public roads or highways which are under the jurisdiction
of a state or local transportation authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) would authorize the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on Forest Service trails subject
to terms and conditions necessary to ensure the safe use of these facilities and when compatible with the management
objectives identified in section 7 of the Act. As envisioned in the proposed rule, motorized and mechanical equipment
could only be used on Forest Service trails in the non-wilderness portions of the HCNRA pursuant to a finding that such
use was compatible with, among other things, the protection of free-flowing rivers, the conservation of wilderness
and other values, the maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat, and/or the protection of historic, archeologic,
and paleontologic sites. If a particular proposed use was compatible with some of the management objectives but not
with others, the Ranger would have to decide whether, on balance, the compatibility outweighed the incompatibility
and the use could proceed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) would authorize the use of mechanical equipment off National Forest airstrips, roads, or trails
only if such use is compatible with the management objectives of section 7 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(4) would prohibit the use of motorized equipment off Forest Service airstrips, roads, and trails except
in those cases where it is reasonably necessary to attain one or more of the management objectives set out in section
7. Under this standard, use of an off-road vehicle (ORV) might only be permitted if it were necessary to protect fish
and wildlife habitat or preserve historic resources. ORV use also might be allowable if it were necessary to conduct
the types of timber harvesting, mining, and grazing that are provided for in the proposed rule. It will be the responsibility
of the proponent of such use to demonstrate its necessity related to the management objectives in section 7.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These standards, when read together, establish a three-tiered system governing motorized and mechanical equipment
use in the non-wilderness portion of the HCNRA. The requirements by which use may be authorized become increasingly
rigorous depending on whether the proposed use is contemplated on Forest Service roads/airfields, Forest Service
trails, or off Forest Service airstrips, roads, or trails. This provision recognizes that off-road travel is generally
not tolerated within the HCNRA due to the fragile and difficult terrain, impacts to wildlife and their habitat, and
other issues associated with resource protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) explains that there are no non-duplicative regulations needed for managing motorized and
mechanical equipment in wilderness areas of the HCNRA since such use is already prohibited by the Wilderness Act.
Accordingly, the proposed rule would merely restate the exiting prohibition and provide cross-references to exceptions
permitted in the Wilderness Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would exempt from its coverage all uses related to Forest Service administration which might include,
at a minimum, research activities and public health and safety responses. It also would exclude uses necessary to
access privately owned lands or interests in land wholly within the HCNRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;292.45 would establish seven standards to guide Forest Service administration of the use of motorized
and non-motorized rivercraft in the HCNRA. These standards and guidelines are only applicable to those rivers or
river segments that have been designated as components of the Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Though not explicitly
referenced, the relevant provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and regulations at 36 CFR part 297, would also apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) would authorize the use of non-motorized rivercraft on Wild and Scenic Rivers subject to such rules
and regulations the Ranger deems necessary to protect and enhance the values which caused the river to be designated
wild and scenic or to ensure the public's safe use and enjoyment of the river.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) would prohibit the use of motorized rivercraft on all Wild and Scenic Rivers except for the Snake River.
This prohibition will not prevent the exercise of any type of currently authorized motorized rivercraft use in the
HCNRA; rather, it will simply provide for management of this use which is currently limited to the Snake River. It does,
however, effectively preclude expansion of motorized rivercraft use to other Wild and Scenic Rivers which will facilitate
the protection and enhancement of the values which caused those rivers to be designated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) would require that all authorized rivercraft use on Wild and Scenic Rivers in the HCNRA be in compliance
with State and/or Federal boating safety and registration laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) establishes a requirement that all users of motorized and non-motorized rivercraft on the
Snake Wild and Scenic River must receive prior written authorization for such use from the Ranger. It also explains
that such authorization may include terms and conditions on numbers, duration, seasons of use, noise, or other matters
that will protect and enhance the river resource and ensure a high quality river experience for users of all types.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (e) and (f) are extensions of paragraph (d) and would require the Ranger, as part of the written authorization
process for the Snake Wild and Scenic River, to make sure that both private and commercial rivercraft users are reasonably
accommodated, and that the user capacity of the river is not exceeded, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (g) would require the Ranger to identify and minimize to the extent practicable any existing or
potential conflicts between motorized and non-motorized rivercraft users or between rivercraft users in general
and other individuals like fishermen or researchers who may use or enjoy the Wild and Scenic Rivers in the HCNRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These standards and guidelines have been narrowly tailored to address those specific types of rivercraft use on those
specific river segments where the greatest potential risk exists to the agency's ability to administer the HCNRA
in such a way as to protect and enhance its natural, cultural, recreational, fishery and other resource values. With
respect to the use of rivercraft, the greatest risk is currently presented by the use of motorized rivercraft on the
Snake Wild and Scenic River. As a result, most of the standards and guidelines in this section pertain to that use on
that river. Though the authority exists, it was deemed unnecessary to establish additional standards for other Wild
and Scenic Rivers or other rivers in the HCNRA at this time to address future contingencies which may or may not ultimately
materialize.

Section 292.46&blank;Timber Harvesting Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;292.46 would establish three standards to guide Forest Service administration of timber harvesting
activities on National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(2) set forth the standards
and guidelines for timber harvesting activities in the Other Lands category of the HCNRA; proposed paragraph (b)
establishes the standard in the Wilderness Lands. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of
the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and regulations at 36 CFR part 223, 261 and 293 would also apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) would specify that timber will not be harvested solely for commercial gain but, rather, will be harvested
only in conjunction with other, non-commercial purposes including maintenance or improvement of ecosystem health,
wildlife habitat, or the recreational use and enjoyment of the HCNRA. Trees could also be removed to eliminate hazards
to persons or their property. Finally, timber harvesting could also be employed as an appropriate and measured response
to natural events including, but not limited to, fire, flood, and disease or pest infestation. The significance of
this provision is that it does not provide for timber production in and of itself to be an objective of the timber harvesting
activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances where one or more of the purposes for which timber may be harvested is recognized, paragraph (a)(2)
conditions the manner by which the timber may be harvested. These silvicultural prescriptions authorize timber
harvesting only by means of selective or intermediate cuttings. For the purpose of this proposed rule, the term ``selective
cutting'' means ``selection cutting'' as that term is defined by the Society of American Foresters. The Agency believes
that the Act, in discussing the permissible types of silvicultural prescriptions in the HCNRA, incorrectly used
the term ``selective cutting'' which is a type of exploitation cutting generally referred to as ``creaming'', ``culling'',
or ``high-grading''. For that reason, the Agency defined ``selective cutting'' as ``selection cutting'' which
is, in all likelihood, the term Congress intended to use in the Act and which means the annual or periodic removal of
trees individually or in small groups. The other types of authorized cuttings are well understood within the forestry
profession and are defined in the proposed rule as they appear in the book, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terminology of Forest Science Technology Practice and Products
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, published by the Society of American Foresters. These types of cuttings represent the most ecologically sensitive
methods by which harvesting can be accomplished. Additional proposed restrictions on harvesting in this proposed
section include requirements that the smallest area and least number of clearings be created, and that the clearings
blend into the natural landscape to the extent practicable. These provisions would ensure that any timber harvesting
allowable within the HCNRA would proceed as unobtrusively as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) explains that there are no non-duplicative regulations needed for managing timber harvesting
activities in wilderness areas of the HCNRA since such use is already generally prohibited by the Wilderness Act.
Accordingly, it merely restates the existing prohibition and provides cross references to exceptions permitted
in the Wilderness Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 292.47 would establish six standards to guide Forest Service administration of mining activities throughout
the entire HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(4) set forth the standards and guidelines for mining activities
in the Other Lands category of the HCNRA; proposed paragraphs (b)(1)&hyph;(2) establish the standards for the Wilderness
Lands category. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the 1872 Mining Law, 30 U.S.C. 22

, and regulations at 36 CFR parts 228 and 293 would also apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) prohibits mining activities in the HCNRA subject to valid existing rights. This is a restatement of
Section 11 of the Act which withdrew all federal lands within the HCNRA from the operation of the mining and mineral
leasing laws subject to valid existing rights. Accordingly, the only authorized mining activities that may occur
in the HCNRA are those in which the valid existing rights have been established. Holders of mining claims and mineral
leases must demonstrate that they have valid existing rights before land disturbing activities can be initiated.
This requirement would also extend to what in common parlance has become known as ``recreational mining.'' There
is no authority for recreational mining other than the statutes cited in the preceding paragraph. Thus, even if an
operator claims that an activity involving the exploration and/or extraction of mineral resources is ``recreational''
in nature, that operator must prove that he or she has valid existing rights to conduct that activity under one of the
aforementioned statutes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b) proposes that the impact of mining activities be directed away from the Wilderness Lands and Wild and
Scenic Rivers to the extent practicable. This would enable the impacts of developmental drilling operations and
the construction of access routes, among other things, to be concentrated on lands which may be better suited to such
uses or which may not possess the number or degree of resource values exhibited on Wilderness Lands or Wild and Scenic
Rivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (c) and (d) concern the extraction and use of mineral materials in the HCNRA. Mineral materials include,
but are not limited to, common varieties of sand, gravel, and stone and are governed by the Mineral Materials Act of
1947, 30 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, rather than the mining and mineral leasing laws. As a result, activities related to mineral materials are not subject
to the withdrawal of federal lands from the operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws in Section 11 of the Act.
These standards, in addition to the applicable provisions of Subpart C of 36 CFR part 228, specify the circumstances
under which exploration, extraction and use of common variety mineral materials may occur in the HCNRA. Paragraph
(c) would provide that mineral materials may only be used in the HCNRA for the purpose of constructing or maintaining
facilities such as roads, existing airfields, trails and other recreation developments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) would require that mineral materials needed for use in the HCNRA for one of the enumerated purposes in
paragraph (c) or for use outside the HCNRA on a project with specific and identifiable benefits for the HCNRA must come
from sources located outside the HCNRA unless (1) the cost associated with using non-HCNRA mineral materials adds
significantly to the costs of the material, or (2) the transportation of mineral materials from outside the HCNRA
presents a safety hazard to the motoring public.When mineral materials are obtained from inside the HCNRA, environmental
impact at the source must be mitigated by contouring the land, re-establishing vegetation, and other appropriate
measures. This paragraph would further prohibit the extraction of mineral materials from sources inside the HCNRA
if the use would be outside the HCNRA and would not directly benefit the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would incorporate the standards and guidelines in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) for Other
Lands and apply them to Wilderness Lands. This would ensure the consistency of Forest Service administration of mining
activities within the HCNRA and further the protection and enhancement of the values which caused Congress to designate
the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) would prohibit the extraction of mineral materials from the Wilderness Lands. This is a restatement
of existing authority in 36 CFR 293.14(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of the foregoing standards is to provide for the continued maintenance and development of facilities and
transportation routes necessary for the administration and safe use and enjoyment of the HCNRA while at the same time
minimizing the impacts of such activities on HCNRA lands and directing such activities to non-HCNRA lands wherever
possible.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;292.48 would create four standards to guide Forest Service administration of grazing activities
on National Forest System lands throughout the entire HCNRA. The agency felt that one set of standards and guidelines
for the entire HCNRA would be simpler to administer and would adequately provide for the continuation of grazing and
the protection and enhancement of the HCNRA resource values. Though not expressly referenced, the relevant provisions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and regulations at 36 CFR part 222 would also apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) would authorize the grazing of domestic livestock only on National Forest rangeland that has been found
to be in satisfactory condition. In those situations where the land is suitable and in satisfactory conditions, livestock
grazing could only take place in such numbers, seasons, and methods which will ensure that the satisfactory condition
is maintained. This provision will ensure that domestic livestock grazing will not occur on rangelands that are currently
in substandard condition nor will it occur in such a way as to degrade rangelands that are currently in satisfactory
condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) requires the Forest Service to administer the grazing program to minimize or eliminate conflicts
between domestic livestock and fish and wildlife, outdoor recreation, and the preservation and conservation of
the other natural values for which the HCNRA was established by adjusting the level, type of livestock, or manner of
grazing. This paragraph further requires that the domestic livestock grazing must cease in the event that the adjustment
in the grazing activity has failed to eliminate the conflict. This ensures that grazing will not continue if it can
not be conducted in a manner that is compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established.

This could involve fences or water storage facilities being constructed in a visually inconspicuous fashion or the
use of vegetative treatments in an environmentally sensitive manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) would require that in administering the domestic livestock grazing program, measures must be instituted
to protect and conserve riparian areas. This could take the form of restrictions on place, time, or manner of livestock
grazing and would be in furtherance of protecting and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat which is one of the management
objectives of the HCNRA.

Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule establishes standards for National Forest System lands within the HCNRA to ensure that the activities
which occur on the National Forest System lands within the HCNRA are compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA
was created. The proposed regulations have been carefully drafted to include only those management standards and
guidelines which are nonduplicative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except in those instances in which there would be a direct and irreconcilable conflict, this proposed rule would not
supplant the Forest Service's existing regulatory authority related to National Forest System lands. This regulatory
authority covers a panoply of subjects including, but not limited to, range management (36 CFR part 222), timber (36
CFR part 223), minerals (36 CFR part 228), off-road vehicle use (36 CFR part 295), archeological resources (36 CFR
part 296), and historic and cultural properties (36 CFR part 800).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nor would this proposed rule simply restate the current regulatory authority of the Forest Service to administer
the National Forest System lands. Instead, this proposed rule would augment existing regulatory authority to establish
standards and guidelines that would address the subject matter areas identified in section 10 that were of particular
concern to Congress when the HCNRA was established in 1975. Public comment is invited and will be considered in adoption
of a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, these standards and guidelines will protect and preserve historic, archeologic, and paleontologic
resources; provide for the use of motorized and mechanical equipment; provide for the use of motorized and nonmotorized
rivercraft; and establish the permissible scope and extent of timber harvesting, mining, and grazing on National
Forest System lands in the HCNRA. In so doing, the Forest Service will be able to ensure that the natural beauty, historical,
and archeological values of the HCNRA are preserved for this and future generations, and that the recreational and
ecological values and public enjoyment of the area are thereby enhanced.

This proposed rule is promulgated in accordance with section 10 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 460gg&hyph;7. The affected environment
and consequences of implementing management alternatives for the HCNRA were analyzed and disclosed in the Environmental
Impact Statement for the Comprehensive Management Plan that was implemented by the Chief of the Forest Service on
May 23, 1981. The analysis completed for the Comprehensive Management Plan was revalidated in April 1990 with the
signing of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Record of Decision (page 1). A review
of this proposed rule indicates no potential for significant effect on the quality of the human environmental other
than that previously disclosed in the Environmental Impact Statement. The environmental consequences of any future
projects will be subject to site specific analysis pursuant to Forest Service National Environmental Policy Act
procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950, Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). Therefore, no additional environmental
documentation is deemed needed on this rule. Information pertaining to the environmental analysis may be obtained

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This revision provides for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Executive Office of Transportation and Construction
to construct and operate specified transit facilities and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes established therein.
Implementation of the defined transportation projects will help reduce the use of automobiles, provide for additional
transit facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Region, and improve traffic operations on the region's roadways,
resulting in improved air quality. This action should have a beneficial effect on air quality because it is intended
to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the Boston Metropolitan Area. The emissions to be reduced include hydrocarbons
(ground-level ozone precursors) and carbon monoxide (CO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is being taken under section 110(a) and (l) of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 9, 1991, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MA DEP) submitted a revision to its
SIP for Transit Systems Improvements and HOV Facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District.
This new regulation commits the Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation and Construction (MA EOTC) to
pursue implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of transit system improvements and HOV facilities that were
identified as transportation and air quality mitigation measures in a 1990 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement for the CA/THT project. EPA determined five of the proposed TCMs were necessary to help achieve an air quality
benefit from the CA/THT. This SIP amendment amends 310 CMR 7.00 by adding two new sections; 310 CMR 7.36&hyph;''Transit
System Improvements,'' and 310 CMR 7.37&hyph;''High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of the proposed regulation is to reduce concentrations of ground-level ozone by codifying commitments
from the MA EOTC to implement HOV and transit system improvements. These commitments were originally included as
part of a Metropolitan Planning Organization-approved Memorandum of Understanding (MOU): Traffic and Air Quality
Mitigation For the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project (CA/T) and were incorporated into Massachusetts
Air Pollution Control Regulations 310 CMR 7.00 through adding Section 7.36: Transit System Improvements; and Section
7.37: High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes. The regulations are designed to help reduce the use of automobiles, to provide
for additional transit facilities in the Metropolitan Boston region, and to improve traffic operations on the region's
roadways, resulting in improved air quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing VMT eases traffic congestion and can lead to improved air quality. To the extent that reductions in regional
VMT improve traffic flow, a subsequent reduction in the sources of CO and volatile organic compounds (VOC) may be achieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing VMT will also contribute to a direct and indirect reduction in air toxics. Emissions from gasoline-driven
engines contain air toxics, such as benzene, a known carcinogen. Many products of incomplete combustion, including
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo-a-pyrene, are emitted by gasoline and diesel engines and are associated
with chronic and acute health effects. Gasoline vapors released during transfer or pumping of fuel also contain benzene
and other air toxics. The health effects of air toxics are wide-ranging and can vary from long-term carcinogenic effects,
to short-term adverse health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Massachusetts regulations are designed to support the Commonwealth's transportation control strategies and
future attempts to control VMT and ease traffic congestion in the metropolitan Boston Area. For example, the facilities
provided for in these regulations could support the development of employee trip-reduction programs by creating
alternatives to single-occupant vehicles.

Summary of Proposed Transit System Improvements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Transit System Improvements regulation consists of seven subsections summarized as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Applicability: The transit system improvements regulation applies to MA EOTC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Project Delays, Project Deadline Extensions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Substitute Transit System Improvement Projects: As described above, section 7.36(2) of the regulation identifies
specific transit projects which must be completed by specific dates. In section 7.36(3) of the regulation, however,
it appears MA EOTC is authorized to send MA DEP a notice delaying the completion date for any project. If the date is delayed
for more than three years, the rule requires MA EOTC to propose a substitute transit improvement project under the
process contained in section 7.36(4). EPA is taking comments on the way the transit project regulation addresses
project delays and substitute projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 7.36(4), MA EOTC may at any time, and pursuant to 7.36(3) must in the event of a delay of over 3 years, propose a substitute
transit project to MA DEP. MA EOTC may substitute a project if EOTC demonstrates to MA DEP that the project:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * achieves equal or greater emission reductions of nonmethane hydocarbons [sic] (NMHC), carbon monoxide (C0)
and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and would provide a greater improvement in air quality for CO and NOx in the area where the
required project was to have been implemented, in both the short and long term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
310 CMR 7.36(4)(a)(1). MA DEP must supply EPA with a copy of MA EOTC's petition for the substitute, any demonstration,
and MA DEP's action on the petition. However, EPA has no role in approving the project or reviewing it prior to MA DEP's
acceptance of the substitute. In addition, there is also no public notice provided for any decision to substitute
a project.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has two concerns with these provisions. First, EPA and the public cannot rely on the completion dates listed in
7.36(2) as the final enforceable compliance dates for the transit projects. The rule allows MA EOTC and MA DEP to extend
those dates by at least 3 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, and more importantly, at the end of any 3 year delay or any time before that, MA DEP is authorized, without any
EPA concurrence or public comment, to substitute another transit project for those listed in the rule. MA DEP has imposed
on itself and MA EOTC a standard for reviewing substitute projects, quoted above, that essentially requires the new
project to provide air quality benefits equivalent to or better than the original project specified in the regulation.
But other than to limit substitute projects to ``transit improvement projects,'' the type of substitute project
is otherwise unconstrained by the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many types of transportation control measures that might reasonably be treated as substitute transit projects
under this rule, ranging from concrete capital investments such as different rail lines or special bus lanes to market-based
incentives such as mass transit fare subsidies or highway tolls.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is impossible for EPA to know what sort of substitute projects MA DEP might be evaluating in the future. Consequently,
it is also impossible for EPA to judge objectively the equivalency of any new project, since the MA DEP has not committed
to using EPA-approved methodology for determining air quality benefits. The regulation does not provide for any
specific quantification methodology that might allow EPA to assess the replicability of any air quality benefits
analysis MA DEP will conduct in evaluating a substitute project. Therefore, EPA cannot now calculate with acceptable
reliability the emissions reductions MA DEP, EPA, and the public will be able to enforce under this rule.

For example, the regulation elsewhere requires EOTC to study the feasibility of implementing toll pricing, operating
water shuttle services, improving rail service among major cities in the region, and indexing transit fares to encourage
use of transit facilities. 310 CMR 7.36(6). (See also the types of TCM's enumerated in section 108(f) of the Act.)

On the other hand, EPA believes that the kind of transit measures identified in this rule are directionally sound and
that any substitute project meeting the standard contained in the rule should contribute to achieving the air quality
standards for ozone and CO. Since under the current ozone and CO SIPs for this area, there are no specific measures to
promote transit projects, section 7.36 must necessarily contribute more emissions reductions toward attainment
than the existing SIP. So although EPA has concerns about the quantification of air quality benefits these rules will
achieve, EPA is prepared to approve them into the SIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the transit system improvement regulations and, as discussed below, the HOV regulations are not strictly
speaking economic incentive program (EIP) rules under either sections 182 or 187 of the Act, the analogy to so-called
``directionally sound'' EIPs is useful. In its recent proposal to guide implementation of EIPs, EPA defines directionally
sound strategies as ``strategies for which adequate procedures to quantify emission reductions . . . are not defined
as part of the EIP.'' 58 FR 11126, &sect;51.491 (Feb. 23, 1993). The proposal provides that directionally sound strategies
that ``do not yield quantifiable emissions reductions creditable towards RFP or attainment demonstrations . . .
may be included in an area's attainment plan, without credit . . . if the strategy contributes to the area coming into
. . . attainment.'' 58 FR 11113. Similarly, the transit project and HOV regulations do not provide for adequate procedures
to quantify emission reductions from substitute projects, but should generally contribute toward attainment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address EPA's concerns, however, the Agency proposes not to grant Massachusetts any credit for emissions reductions
from these measures in any reasonable further progress (RFP), attainment, or maintenance demonstration, unless
DEP submits a SIP revision making the requirement for the transit measure, or any substitute for that measure, federally
enforceable. Upon approval of the SIP revision including the transit measure, Massachusetts could take credit for
the measure, and the requirement to implement that measure would become an enforceable part of the SIP. EPA is proposing
this approach because without a SIP revision, DEP could substitute the specific transit enhancements in these rules
for another at any time. Given the inherent uncertainty in quantifying the emission impacts of potential substitution
measures, as described above, EPA and the public may be left without an adequate remedy under the DEP rule to assure
that the substitute project is in fact yielding equivalent emissions reductions. The SIP revision process gives
EPA and the public an opportunity to examine Massachusetts' proposed emissions reduction credits. If DEP asks for
credit for the measures specified in this proposed rule, approving an enforceable commitment of the Commonwealth
into the SIP should be a relatively simple matter. Where the SIP revision proposes a substitute project, EPA and the
public may need to examine whether the substitute in fact achieves equivalent reductions.

EPA invites comment on which projects are sufficiently complete to be credited upon approval of this rule, and invites
any documentation DEP can provide that any projects should receive credit upon approval of this rule. Additionally,
EPA invites comment on how to determine whether a transit project that does not require any construction is ``substantially
complete.'' Market-based programs such as congestion tolls may require no construction. EPA proposes to credit
such projects when they are ready to implement.

(5) Project Review and Consultation: MA EOTC must consult with the MA Highway (formerly MA Department of Public Works),
the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), EPA, and
MA DEP on a quarterly basis when planning, directing, constructing, or making transit system improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Transit System Improvement Studies: By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC must draft and issue for comment an initial study
of transit improvement strategies (in addition to those listed above), which will ultimately be incorporated into
a Program for Mass Transit (PMT). By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC must draft and issue for comment the following transit
system improvement studies: a toll pricing feasibility study to regulate single occupant vehicle trips to Logan
Airport; a study of the feasibility of relocating some of the existing Sumner Tunnel Toll booths to Route 1A; a water
shuttle service (for service between Boston and the North Shore) feasibility study; a study of transit system improvements
which could be made in addition to those specific improvements listed above also in 310 CMR 7.36(2); a study of the feasibility
of constructing a rail connection between South Station and Logan Airport; a study to expand the size and number of
suburban locations of Logan airport express service parking and transit facilities; a study to expand the HOV lanes
and services within the boundaries of Logan Airport. By December 31, 1994, MA EOTC must draft and issue for comment
a study of transit system improvements including: connecting circumferential transit facilities and radial transit
services; improving travel times and upgrading rail service to New York City NY, Worcester MA, Springfield MA, Hartford
CT and Portland ME; and indexing transit fares to maximize the use of transit. Each study identified above would include
a technical feasibility analysis, estimates of time and costs associated with implementing the measures, and the
air quality impacts of the measure. Final reports for studies in this subsection, containing recommendations and
schedule for further action, must be released by March 30 of the year following the deadline of the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Record Keeping and Reporting: By March 1st of each year, MA EOTC must submit a progress report to the MA DEP on the
status of each transit project/study in the regulation. The report must contain expected impacts on transit ridership
system-wide. The report will be distributed to members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and other
interested parties. EPA wishes to identify itself as an interested party at this time and requests that copies of the
reports be forwarded to the EPA Regional Office.

Summary of Proposed High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes regulation consists of eleven subsections summarized as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Applicability: The regulation applies to MA EOTC and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HOV Lanes: By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC shall extend the I&hyph;93 Southbound HOV lane (north of the southern bank
of the Charles River) toward Route 128 to the northernmost point appropriate. Additionally, the final design of the
Charles River crossing on the southbound side of I&hyph;93 extending down to the exit ramp to Nashua Street shall include
an HOV lane on the southbound side of I&hyph;93. Furthermore, by May 31, 1993, MA EOTC shall construct and make available
HOV lanes northbound and southbound on I&hyph;93 beginning at the intersection of I&hyph;93 with I&hyph;90 and extending
to a point immediately north of the intersection of I&hyph;93 and Route 3 if the threshold standards described below
are violated for three consecutive months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Establishment of Roadway Threshold Standards: By October 1, 1991, MA EOTC shall develop roadway threshold standards
that represent a significant increase in traffic volume above baseline roadway conditions and that can trigger construction
of an HOV lane. Roadway threshold standards shall be calculated to represent an average weekday peak-hour trip time
increase of 35 percent from baseline roadway conditions. By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC must document, maintain, and
submit such conditions to the MA DEP for I&hyph;93 north- and south-bound between I&hyph;90 and Rte. 3 in Braintree;
and I&hyph;93 north-bound between the Charles River crossing and I&hyph;95 (Route 128). By December 31, 1991, MTA
must establish roadway threshold standards for I&hyph;90 east- and west-bound between I&hyph;93 and I&hyph;95
(Route 128). By December 31, 1993, MA EOTC and the MTA shall each collect such information as is necessary to identify
and document baseline roadway conditions for all these roadway segments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Feasibility Studies: Before December 31, 1992, MA EOTC shall study the feasibility of HOV lanes for the road segments
for which threshold standards are set under subsection (3) above. The study shall assess the impact of HOV lanes on
emissions, general purpose traffic, and engineering issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Additional HOV Facilities: Roadway Threshold Standards: Beginning on January 1, 1992, MA EOTC and the MTA must
monitor roadway segments listed in (3) above on a monthly basis to ensure that average trip times do not exceed roadway
threshold standards. If the roadway threshold standards are exceeded for any three-month consecutive period, MA
EOTC is required to notify MA DEP and to implement certain HOV measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MA EOTC's notice to MA DEP will include a schedule for implementing an HOV lane on the road segment violating the roadway
threshold standards.

 There is no requirement limiting the time by which an HOV lane must be implemented. However, the addition of HOV lanes
on I&hyph;93 in either direction between I&hyph;90 and Route 3 and on I&hyph;90 in either direction between I&hyph;93
and I&hyph;95 must be found to be feasible in the study to be conducted under subsection 4, above. As discussed below,
if an HOV lane is determined to be infeasible on a roadway where threshold standards are exceeded, MA EOTC can propose
a substitute project.

The requirement for submitting a notice of violation of the roadway threshold standards in section 7.37(5)(b) only
refers to EOTC and not the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority as well, whereas several surrounding provisions refer
to both (see sections 7.37(5)(a) and (d)). EPA notes that section 7.37(c)(2) creates an obligation to add an HOV lane
to the Massachusetts Turnpike if threshold standards are violated. EPA assumes EOTC is fully authorized to submit
a notice of violation triggering such an obligation on the Turnpike and the Turnpike Authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) HOV Performance Standards: Performance standards are defined as the range of roadway performance between Level
of Service B and a condition of under-utilization. Within 30 days of implementation of an HOV facility, MA EOTC and
MTA must submit performance standards for each HOV facility or HOV lane under their respective jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Continuous Attainment of Performance Standards: Beginning on January 1, 1991, MA EOTC and MTA must monitor HOV
performance- measuring trip times quarterly. Measurements must be taken on 5&hyph;7 weekdays over two consecutive
weeks within each quarter. A minimum of three time runs must be made in each direction for each HOV roadway segment on
each sample day. MA EOTC and MTA must take all appropriate measures to maintain compliance with the performance standards,
including increasing the number of occupants required to be eligible for the HOV lane. If the performance standards
are exceeded for each time run, MA EOTC must report the exceedance to the MA DEP within 10 days of the end of the month in
which the exceedance took place, including measures necessary to return the roadway or facility to compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Substitute High Occupancy Vehicle Projects: If the feasibility studies provided for in subsection (4) demonstrate
that an HOV lane is infeasible, MA EOTC can substitute an alternative project by petitioning MA DEP. The petition must:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * include a demonstration that the alternative project achieves equal or greater emission reductions of NMHC,
CO, and NOx and would provide a greater improvement in air quality for CO and Nox [sic] in the areas where the required
high occupancy vehicle lane was targeted, both short- and long-term.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
310 CMR 7.37(8)(a)(1). The MA DEP is then authorized to substitute an alternative project. Similar to the substitution
process for transit projects outlined above, EPA must receive a copy of MA EOTC's petition and demonstrations, and
MA DEP's petition, determination, and supporting documentation; but EPA has no role in reviewing or approving the
substitute before approval by MA DEP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the same reasons described above, EPA is prepared to approve 310 CMR 7.37 into the SIP as a directionally sound measure,
but not to grant any credit in RFP, attainment, or maintenance demonstrations until the Commonwealth irrevocably
commits to specific HOV facilities or substitute measures in a SIP revision. It appears that the first HOV segment,
on I&hyph;93 southbound, is largely completed. Beyond that segment, however, the rule allows MA DEP to substitute
alternative projects for future HOV lanes without any EPA or public scrutiny of the substitute project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) HOV Studies and Further Actions: MA EOTC must take steps to enhance and expand Massachusetts Turnpike Authority
HOV facilities including the following: a study to improve air quality and HOV flow between Rte. 128 and Boston and
to examine full-scale HOV lanes and mechanisms; and a program of HOV toll booths with demarcated lanes, privileges,
and provisions of electronic ID systems to facilitate HOV flow through toll booths.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By December 31, 1992 MA EOTC shall in consultation with MA Highway and MTA submit a study to the MA DEP that defines the
feasibility of establishing HOV lanes and HOV incentives for these highways: I&hyph;93 northbound and southbound
between I&hyph;90 and Route 3 in Braintree; I&hyph;93 northbound between the Charles River Crossing and I&hyph;95;
and I&hyph;90 eastbound and westbound between I&hyph;93 and I&hyph;95.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) HOV Promotion and Enforcement: By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC and MTA must submit an enforcement program and plan
to the MA DEP. By April 1, 1992 MA EOTC and MTA shall submit a program to promote HOV use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) HOV Expansion to the Local Roadway Network: MA EOTC shall encourage the City of Boston to incorporate HOV facilities
into the construction and reconstruction of city streets, and shall work with the Massachusetts Port Authority to
study HOV needs at Logan Airport.

Air Quality Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, EPA believes that the mass transit and HOV facilities promoted by these regulations support air
quality goals and assist in the maintenance of projected air quality emissions. EPA's review of this material indicates
that the implementation and operation of the mass transit and HOV facilities will result in improved air quality,
by reducing vehicle trips, providing increased public transit services, and reducing the number of single occupant
motor vehicles. Reducing VMT will also ease traffic congestion. EPA is therefore proposing to approve the Massachusetts
SIP revision for Ozone and for Carbon Monoxide, for Transit Systems Improvements and High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District, which was submitted on December 10, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to approve the SIP amendment for Ozone and for Carbon Monoxide, for Transit Systems Improvements
and High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709.) SIP approvals (or redesignations) do not create any new requirements but
simply approve requirements that are already State law. SIP approvals (or redesignations), therefore, do not add
any additional requirements for small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under
the Clean Air Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute Federal inquiry into
the economic reasonableness of the state actions. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
this waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order
12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP will be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revision will be based on whether it meets the requirements
of

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the revocation of tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the herbicide alachlor (2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-(methoxymethyl)acetanilide) and its metabolites in or on the following raw agricultural commodities listed in
40 CFR 180.249: Cotton forage, cottonseed, sunflower seed, pea forage, pea hay, peas with the pods removed, and potatoes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By March 1988, the product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended, for the pesticide products containing the herbicide alachlor were canceled for the above-mentioned
raw agricultural commodities. Based on the fact that alachlor is no longer domestically registered for use on these
food crops and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for the particular
food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.249 for residues of alachlor in or on these commodities.
Since the product registrations were canceled more than 5 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated,
domestically produced commodities. These tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances because sufficient
time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate, and EPA does not expect a residue problem due to environmental
contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests that interested persons submit information pertaining to whether these products are used in foreign
countries and may be present in commodities grown in those countries and imported to the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under FIFRA which contains
alachlor may request that this rulemaking proposal to revoke the tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee
in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300315]. All written comments filed in response to this document will

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulatory action has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94
Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all registrations for use of alachlor on these food crops were canceled more than 5 years ago, it is anticipated
that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances were revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, I certify that this proposed regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility
analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the revocation of tolerances and feed additive regulations established under sections 408
and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a and 348, respectively, for residues of the
insecticide demeton (a mixture of

)-2-(ethylthio)ethylphosphorothioates) in or on raw agricultural commodities and animal feeds. EPA is initiating
this action because all registered uses of this chemical on raw agricultural commodities have been canceled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By mid-October 1989, all product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
for pesticide products containing the insecticide demeton were canceled. Based on the fact that demeton is no longer
domestically registered for use on any food crops, and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical
which is not registered for the particular food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances and feed additive regulations
for residues of demeton as listed 40 CFR 180.105 and 40 CFR 186.1600. Since the product registrations were canceled
more than 3 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated, domestically produced commodities. These
tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 180.105.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to revoke the following tolerances for residues of the insecticide demeton in or on the following
commodities: 12 parts per million in or on alfalfa hay, clover hay; 5 parts per million in or on almond hulls, barley
(green fodder and straw), fresh alfalfa, fresh clover, oats (green fodder and straw), sugar beet tops, and wheat (green
fodder and straw); 1.25 parts per million in or on grapes, hops; 0.75 part per million in or on almonds, apples, apricots,
barley grain, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cottonseed, filberts, grapefruit, lemons,
lettuce, muskmelons, nectarines, oat grain, oranges, peaches, pears, peas, pecans, peppers, plums (fresh prunes),
potatoes, strawberries, tomatoes, walnuts, wheat grain; 0.5 part per million in or on sugar beets; 0.3 part per million
in or on beans, eggplants; 0.2 part per million in or on sorghum grain, sorghum forage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 186.1600
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA is proposing to revoke a tolerance of 5 parts per million for residues of demeton in dehydrated sugar beet pulp
for livestock feed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances and feed additive regulations
because sufficient time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate and does not anticipate a residue problem
due to environmental contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has no information at this time to suggest that demeton is used on food commodities exported to the U.S. Therefore,
EPA is requesting that interested persons submit information pertaining to whether these products are used in foreign
countries and may be present in commodities grown in those countries and imported to the U.S.

it pertains to section 408 tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulatory action has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94
Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all registrations for use of demeton on food crops were canceled more than 3 years ago, it is anticipated that
no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances were revoked. Accordingly,
I certify that this proposed regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 In 1991, the Department issued a report on emergency flow restricting devices (EFRDs) that proposed seeking public
input on the placement of EFRDs at certain locations on hazardous liquid pipelines. The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992
mandated that the Department issue regulations prescribing the circumstances under which operators must use EFRDs
and other equipment used to detect and locate pipeline ruptures on hazardous liquid pipelines. The regulations are
to be issued following a survey and assessment of the effectiveness of such equipment. This advance notice of proposed
rulemaking (ANPRM) poses a series of questions in order to solicit public input for the survey process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The RSPA has been concerned for some time with the issue of more rapid leak detection on hazardous liquid pipelines,
and the optimum placement of EFRDs to limit commodity release after the location of the release in the hazardous liquid
pipeline has been identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 203 of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act (codified at 49 U.S.C. app. &sect;2002(n)) as amended by the
Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (the 1992 Act) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508) mandated the Secretary, within two years of enactment,
to conduct a survey and assess the effectiveness of emergency flow restricting devices (EFRDs) and other procedures,
systems, and equipment used to detect and locate hazardous liquid pipeline ruptures and minimize product releases
from hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. The 1992 amendments further mandated that the Secretary issue regulations
within two years of completion of the survey and assessment. These regulations would prescribe the circumstances
under which operators of hazardous liquid pipelines would use EFRDs and other procedures, systems, and equipment
to detect and locate pipeline ruptures and minimize product release from pipeline facilities. The Secretary has
delegated this authority to the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) (See 49 CFR 1.53).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the Department's March 1991 report titled ``Emergency Flow Restricting Devices Study'' contained proposals
that we seek public input on the placement of EFRDs in urban areas, at water crossings, at other critical areas affected
by commodity release, and areas in close proximity to the public outside of urban areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This ANPRM solicits public input for the survey process mandated by the 1992 Act as well as the proposals from the Department's
1991 EFRD study. The ANPRM requests information and data by posing a series of questions. This approach is utilized
rather than conducting a traditional research survey of a selected number of respondents in order to obtain a broader
base of data and to accelerate the regulatory process.

Notice on Highly Volatile Liquids_1978

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1978, the RSPA issued an NPRM (43 FR 39402; September 5, 1978) proposing requirements intended to limit spillage
from hazardous liquid pipelines carrying highly volatile liquids (HVL)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in inhabited areas by requiring installation of remotely controlled valves (RCVs)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or automatically controlled valves (ACVs).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposal was later withdrawn (46 FR 2130; January 8, 1981) because hazardous liquid pipeline industry studies
demonstrated that placement of closely spaced valves over the full length of an HVL pipeline was not a reasonable method
of reducing the effects of an accident.

An RCV is any valve which is operated from a location remote from where the valve is installed. The location is usually
at the pipeline control or dispatching center. The linkage between the pipeline control center and the RCV may be by

Mounds View Accident
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A July 8, 1986, accident on a gasoline pipeline focused interest on EFRDs. The accident, caused by a ruptured pipe seam
on a gasoline pipeline in Mounds View, Minnesota, resulted in two deaths, one injury, and property damage well in excess
of $1,000,000. The accident was exacerbated by backflow or draining from the pipeline after the manually operated
valves on either side of the ruptured section were closed. The spill ignited approximately 20 minutes after the rupture.
It took the pipeline operator over 1 hour and 40 minutes from the time of the rupture to isolate the ruptured section.
Since this accident, the pipeline company installed a computerized leak-detection system and RCVs on either side
of Mounds View (a distance of about 5.7 miles).

Advance Notice on Certain Safety Proposals_1987
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1987, as a result of the same accident, the RSPA again addressed RCVs and ACVs in an ANPRM (52 FR 4361; February 11,
1987). This ANPRM invited public comment on the merit of certain safety proposals advanced by Congress, the Minnesota
Commission on Pipeline Safety, and the National Transportation Safety Board. One safety proposal was to convert
shutoff valves required by the pipeline safety regulations on existing pipelines to RCVs or ACVs, and require similar
valves on new pipeline construction.

Both gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators indicated that neither RCVs nor ACVs were installed as shutoff valves
as standard practice. They indicated that RCVs and ACVs had little effect to mitigate the extent of the spill because
often, especially in populated areas on gas pipelines, ignition occurred before either type of valve could shut down
a pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific concern of false closure of ACVs was identified in these comments. There was substantial agreement by
both gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators that ACVs should not be used as EFRDs because of their unreliability.
This unreliability was due to the inability of ACV sensors to distinguish between a leak and normal operating fluctuations.
Pipeline operators indicated numerous documented cases of unintended closures of ACVs. A false closure of an ACV
on a hazardous liquid pipeline can cause an immediate pressure buildup or surge which may result in a pipeline rupture.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 23, 1987, the ANPRM was discussed at the joint meeting of the RSPA's Technical Pipeline Safety Standards
Committee and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee. (Both technical committees
were established by the Secretary of Transportation to advise the Department on the technical feasibility, reasonableness,
and practicability of all proposed gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety standards and all amendments to existing
standards.) The committees recommended that the Department study the selective use of RCVs and ACVs.

Emergency Flow Restricting Devices Study_1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 305 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;561), enacted on October 31,
1988, directed a study of the safety, cost, feasibility, and effectiveness of requiring gas and hazardous liquid
pipeline operators to install EFRDs in existing and future pipeline systems in varying circumstances and locations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1991, in response to this Congressional mandate, the Department issued the study titled ``Emergency Flow
Restricting Devices Study.'' One of the conclusions in the study was that RCVs and check valves
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are the only feasible EFRDs. Another conclusion was that requiring the retrofitting of all existing manually operated
valves to RCVs on hazardous liquid pipelines in urban locations, as well as new valves in urban areas appeared to be
cost effective. Still another conclusion in the study was that for an RCV to be effective, a modern supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) system with a well-designed leak detection subsystem was necessary to reduce spills
from hazardous liquid pipelines. The study found that there was no significant benefit from installing EFRDs on gas
transmission pipelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SCADA systems utilize computer technology to analyze data (e.g., pressure, temperature, and delivery flow rates)
that are continuously gathered from remote locations on the pipeline. Computer analysis of this data is used to assist
in day-to-day operating decisions on the pipeline and to provide input for real-time models of the pipeline operation
which can identify and locate leaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCADA-based leak detection subsystems are composed of hardware and software programs that employ a real-time modelling
procedure to compare the current operational conditions of a segment of pipe to an ``ideal'' operating state. This
ideal state is sometimes recalibrated during operations to accommodate variations in conditions (e.g., temperature
or pressure fluctuations in the pipe that occur due to changes in the materials in transport or external environmental
conditions). An ``alarm'' is sent to a central operator when the software model detects a condition that is ``substantially''
different from the idealized state. What makes the condition ``substantially'' different, thereby triggering
the alarm, is determined by the model designer and the conditions imposed on the model, as well as by the amount of data
available on the ``ideal'' state and its normal operational variability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An RCV can operate without a SCADA system installed. However, for an RCV to be used effectively in reducing a spill,
the dispatcher must be able to determine that a pipeline failure has occurred, identify the location of the failure,
and then quickly initiate closure of the valve. Accomplishing these actions in a timely manner requires the installation
of a SCADA system including a well-designed leak detection subsystem. The extensive pollution which resulted from
a 1988 pipeline failure in Maries County, Missouri, to be discussed later in this ANPRM, might have been avoided if
a leak detection subsystem had been installed with the SCADA system allowing operator personnel to detect the leak.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is clear from the RSPA's analysis of information and data obtained in conducting the March 1991 EFRD study, that
spillage from a pipeline failure can be significantly reduced by RCVs only where a modern SCADA system is equipped
with a well-designed leak detection subsystem. The type and sophistication of the control system, installed as part
of an existing SCADA system, depends on the age of the control system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 1991 EFRD study contained a number of proposals to address the issue of EFRDs. One of the proposals was that
the Department conduct a research study on whether SCADA systems, including well-designed leak detection subsystems,
should be required on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to enhance the safe operation of the pipelines. Enhanced
safety requirements would include provision for more rapid response following accidents, including valve spacing
criteria and initiating the closure of RCVs. This study is presently being conducted by the Volpe National Transportation
System Center (VNTSC) and is discussed later in this ANPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another proposal from this study was for the RSPA to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to require, on
hazardous liquid pipelines with SCADA systems installed, that existing manually operated main line block valves

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other proposals in the study suggested public input on whether the hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations
in 49 CFR part 195 should be revised to require valve spacing criteria for EFRDs at the following locations: (1) Where
the valves could most effectively reduce the likelihood of the escaping liquid entering the water at water crossings
that are more than 100-feet wide, and on either side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption; (2) At other
critical areas affected by commodity release; and (3) At specific locations outside of urban areas on hazardous liquid
pipelines in proximity to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the questions posed in this ANPRM are designed to provide data on which the RSPA will decide on a further course
of action concerning the proposed placement of EFRDs in these locations.

To broaden the data base for the March 1991 EFRD study, the RSPA solicited information from the public, including gas
and hazardous liquid pipeline operators and equipment manufacturers, through a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (54 FR 20945; May 15, 1989). A series of 15 questions addressed a number of EFRD/leak detection-related issues
including SCADA technology, establishing a maximum allowable spill value, and criteria for valve spacing. The 72
responses to the notice are contained in Docket PS&hyph;104; Notice 1 and are available for review in the Docket Unit,
room 8421. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice included a series of questions about leak detection subsystems which are part of operators' SCADA systems.
The responses to the questions indicated SCADA systems are becoming more sophisticated and leak detection subsystems
are becoming more common on hazardous liquid pipelines. The sensitivity of leak detection subsystems on hazardous
liquid pipelines was reported to range from 0.5 percent of flow to 5 percent of flow over a 1- to 2-hour period. Once a
leak is suspected, the time for the dispatcher to respond by closing valves ranges from a few minutes for an RCV to an
average of about 2 hours for manually operated valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters to the notice were also asked to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a valve spacing
requirement based on a maximum spill criterion. Two advantages cited by commenters to support establishing a maximum
spill criterion on a hazardous liquid pipeline were: (1) Reduction in the exposure to the public of the possible hazard
created by a spill and (2) improved contingency plans since the plans could be based on a spill of a set volume. However,
commenters cited more disadvantages than advantages.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most hazardous liquid pipeline operators opposed setting a maximum spill criterion. They indicated a maximum acceptable
spill would vary widely along the length of any pipeline depending on spill location. Establishing one criterion
for all pipelines would not account for the variables at each spill location. Commenters indicated that more important
than establishing an arbitrary spill limit is the need to consider the line profile, drainage gradient, length, and
diameter of the hazardous liquid pipeline, susceptibility to outside force damage, population density, and potential
hazards to public safety and the environment. Commenters indicated a spill limit would require more valves, particularly
on large diameter hazardous liquid pipelines. This would increase the opportunity for inadvertent valve closure,
leakage from the valve itself, and vandalism. One commenter stated that protection of the public and environment
is related more to exposure of the hazardous liquid pipeline to the public and response time in detecting and responding
to a failure, than to setting a limit on the volume of product released. This commenter stated: ``The most effective
means for mitigating potential pipeline failure hazards is prompt leak identification, rapid pipeline shutdown,
and immediate dispatch of response crews to the failure site.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were asked if the spacing of RCVs and ACVs is determined by a maximum spill from the hazardous liquid pipeline,
what should that maximum spill value be? None of the commenters provided a maximum spill value. Hazardous liquid pipeline
operators reiterated that the information provided in the responses to the valve spacing question should be used
in the context of spill mitigation rather than to establish a single maximum spill criterion. One commenter stated
that, in addition to pipe diameter, terrain, and the pipeline's route near or in urban areas, the RSPA should consider
the probability of failure, magnitude of the leak, and consequences of the leak in establishing a maximum spill criterion.

December 24, 1988, Failure in Maries County, Missouri
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history for the 1992 Act cites a December 24, 1988, failure in Maries County, Missouri to demonstrate
the need of adequate leak detection equipment. The failure resulted in a crude oil spill of approximately 20,554 barrels
(863,268 gallons). The cause was the abrupt change in pressure and fluid flow from the switching of flowing, low density
crude oil from one pipeline into another containing a substantially heavier oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crude oil released entered a tributary of the Gasconade River, the Gasconade River, the Missouri River, and eventually
the Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri. In order to control the contamination from the large volume of crude
oil released, it was necessary to shut down several water companies along these rivers and a brewery in St. Louis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure of pipeline personnel at the dispatching station to recognize that a rupture had occurred and to shut down
the pipeline greatly increased the volume of crude oil spilled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gasconade River and its tributary, into which the crude oil spill first entered, were bracketed by manually operated
block valves. The RSPA estimates that the installation of a check valve would have prevented drainage from the 5 mile
of pipe on either side of the river, thereby substantially reducing the size of the spill. Also, the installation of
a leak detection subsystem on the SCADA system would probably have substantially reduced the size of the spill.

Current SCADA Study by the VNTSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In May 1992, the RSPA commenced a research study with the VNTSC to analyze SCADA systems and computer-generated leak
detection systems. The purpose of the research study is to determine the feasibility and costs of requiring pipeline
operators to install a SCADA system including a leak detection subsystem, and determine what impediments exist or
what system improvements are needed to minimize the time it takes SCADA systems to detect and locate leaks, and make
recommendations to resolve these difficulties. As mentioned previously, this new initiative is based on findings
from the Department's March 1991 EFRD study concerning RCVs. These valves maximize the value of SCADA-based leak
detection systems by helping to mitigate damages from detected leaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first phase of this study included a literature search on the subject, on-site interviews with seven pipeline
operators, interviews with five equipment vendors, and development of a mathematical model describing optimal
valve spacing for given annual pipeline failure rates per mile and costs, and a method to evaluate alternative leak
detection system performance characteristics to reduce pipeline spill volumes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every pipeline operator surveyed by the contractor used some sort of SCADA system. Most operators had at least one
computerized leak detection system, either one purchased from a vendor, custom designed by the operator, or a combination
of the two systems. All operators interviewed believed that the condition of high false alarm rates was a major drawback
to the installation and operation of leak detection systems. The problem occurs due to the required trade-off between
the threshold volume sensitivity of the leak detection system and the resulting false alarm rate when this sensitivity
is too high. All the operators interviewed emphasized that the most critical link in leak detection was the interface
between the system itself and the pipeline dispatcher, and that there was no substitute for a highly competent pipeline
dispatcher. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VNTSC is drafting a report on the first phase of the study. Once the report is completed, a copy will be placed in the

Questions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RSPA is issuing this ANPRM to solicit data from the public through a series of questions as the means of conducting
the survey mandated in the 1992 Act. The response from the public to these questions will aid in developing proposals
on what circumstances and criteria operators must install EFRDs and other equipment to limit product release from
hazardous liquid pipelines. The failures discussed above suggest that releases can be reduced when EFRDs and well-designed
leak detection systems are installed on hazardous liquid pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessing the data received from the questions in the ANPRM should accelerate the rulemaking process required by
the 1992 Act. The data gathered by this ANPRM, the findings from earlier reports on the subject of EFRDs, including
the Department's March 1991 EFRD study, and the work accomplished so far in the SCADA contract with the VNTSC could
form the basis for any notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the proposed placement of EFRDs and criteria for leak
detection systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RSPA is considering a systems approach to reducing spills from hazardous liquid pipelines. The system involved
includes equipment, personnel, software and procedures to accomplish three tasks: (1) Detect that a failure and
resultant spill has occurred; (2) Identify the location of the spill; and (3) Shut the pipeline down in order to reduce
the amount of the spill. The first two tasks involve computerized leak detection systems, while the third task involves
the installation of EFRDs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the following questions are directed to the operators of hazardous liquid pipelines. They relate to pipeline
system operational data in addition to the physical location of pipeline facilities in relation to geographical
and topographical features which can only be obtained from pipeline operators. However, the RSPA solicits comments
to questions which do not involve data on a particular hazardous liquid pipeline from other members of the public including
State agencies, trade associations, and environmental organizations, both private and public. The RSPA believes
that State pipeline safety agencies can contribute significantly to this rulemaking because of the States' unique
experience with regulating intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines and as the Department's agent on interstate hazardous
liquid pipelines. Questions 18 and 19 are directed to the nonregulated public. These commenters are requested also
to suggest additional questions, including clarification questions, which may emerge from reviewing this ANPRM.

SCADA-based Leak Detection System Sensitivity and Reliability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RSPA needs data on which to base decisions on what should be proposed for SCADA-based leak detection systems. The
RSPA is starting from the premise that most if not all hazardous liquid pipeline operators have installed a SCADA system
which is used for the everyday efficient operation of the pipeline. The SCADA study by the VNTSC has, so far, found this
to be true. (Commenters are requested to indicate if this premise is true.) The RSPA must decide whether to propose:
(1) A specific type of leak detection system; (2) whether to propose requiring certain criteria which would embody
the attributes of all of the presently recognized computerized leak detection systems; (3) a combination of (1) and
(2); or (4) some other leak detection system requirement which at present is unknown to the RSPA but which may emerge
from comments to this ANPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questions are intended to obtain responses which relate to operational data that a hazardous liquid operator
has concerning the SCADA-based leak detection system installed on its pipeline system including the sensitivity
and reliability of that system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions 1 through 6 primarily relate to the experience on a segment of the operator's hazardous liquid pipeline
system which is covered by a SCADA-based leak detection system. If the operator has segments of its hazardous liquid
pipeline system covered by more than one SCADA-based leak detection system, please submit responses to the series
of questions 1 through 6 for each segment of the covered pipeline system. For instance, a SCADA-based leak detection
system may be installed on a 400 mile segment of an interstate pipeline in Texas and another SCADA-based leak detection
system on a 200 mile segment in Virginia. The RSPA requests a separate set of responses for each segment, not aggregate
responses for all of the SCADA-based leak detection systems for all parts of the operator's pipeline system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several topics will be addressed in the set of questions below. These are: (1) The method(s) of leak detection in use
on the segment described in the data submission; (2) leak detection alarms which occur at the hazardous liquid pipeline
systems operating center; (3) the leak detection and SCADA system availability; and (4) the actual performance of
leak detection systems in identifying and locating leaks on an operational hazardous liquid pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the operator does not presently have this data, we encourage the operator to gather the data for at least one month
and then submit it to the RSPA. System alarms history should be provided to the RSPA as a log and may be submitted either
as a computer printout or on a diskette using standard ASCII format as long as the segment identifying information
is clearly noted on the data. Experimental (or simulation-based) data may be provided as well as operational data
which only reflect actual operational experience.

The leak detection performance data should be provided as a log and may be submitted either as a computer printout or
on a diskette using standard ASCII format. Historical performance data gathered during developmental phases such
as system installation and modification also should be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would be helpful if commenters group data for each different data collection time period or pipeline segment, so
that all data (questions 1&hyph;6) relates to only one specific segment and time period. For the purposes of these
questions, a pipeline segment is defined as that part of the pipeline between two points where the product can be contained,
such as between two pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station and a terminal, between a pressure pump
station and a valve, or between two valves.

Placement of EFRDs at water crossings, locations affected by commodity release, and rural areas where the public

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The request for information notice, documented in the Department's March 1991 EFRD study, asked ``Where should RCVs
and ACVs be placed and why?'' The response provided a number of specific locations, e.g., locations where possible
ground movement might occur, and densely populated locations, such as near a school or hospital, near an office building
or factory, or near a shopping center. River crossings were also specified by some commenters. Although conventional
wisdom would seem to suggest installing RCVs at these locations, the RSPA presently has no data which supports requiring
the installation of EFRDs at these locations. The number of these locations is unknown, but one of the following questions
will solicit data on the number of such areas which might be affected by a pipeline release.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Likewise, the number of failures which have resulted in water pollution is unknown because the Department does not
require the occurrence of pollution to be identified on the hazardous liquid pipeline accident report. However,
the RSPA knows from research for developing the interim final rule for onshore oil pipeline response plans (58 FR 244,
January 5, 1993) under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Public Law No. 101&hyph;380, 104 Stat. 484, (OPA 90) that of the
approximately 2,700 oil pipeline spills reported each year to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about
half affect water. The accident effects which would be reduced by the installation of EFRDs are related more to pollution
than safety. Once the hazardous liquid mixes with water, the likelihood of a fire or explosion is reduced considerably.
Two of the following questions address the issue of water pollution as a result of pipeline failures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accidents which occurred in Mounds View, Minnesota and Maries County, Missouri demonstrate that an assessment
by the RSPA should be conducted concerning the installation of EFRDs at specific locations along hazardous liquid
pipelines where the pipelines are in proximity to the public in rural areas, bodies of water (particularly bodies
of water containing drinking water intakes), and other critical locations affected by commodity release. This position
is supported by the NIST report (discussed above) which recommended installation of EFRDs in critical risk locations
to significantly limit the extent of damage if a failure occurs. Critical risk locations are defined in the NIST report
as locations where the risk to public safety, property, and the environment is great. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RSPA is also asking questions to gather data regarding locations where valves are presently required by the regulations
to protect bodies of water (49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f)). The regulations in 49 CFR 195.260 currently require valves
to be placed at locations along a hazardous liquid pipeline that will minimize damage or pollution from accidental
discharges
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 (Section 195.260 (c)), on either side of a water crossing that is more than 100-feet wide (Section 195.260(e)), and
on either side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption (Section 195.260(f)). The American Petroleum Institute
has indicated that most of these main line block valves are manually operated. The current regulations do not require
that they be EFRDs. The financial impact on the regulated industry, if the RSPA were to require the installation of
RCVs, is unknown so cost data will be obtained through responses to questions set forth below.

DOT does not know on what factors hazardous liquid pipeline operators base their judgment on where and how far apart
to place such valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These questions apply only to hazardous liquid pipelines with leak detection systems since the March 1991 EFRD study
concluded RCVs are only effective where leak detection systems are installed. In addition, the questions address
valve spacing, particularly whether EFRDs should be installed at other critical locations. Such critical locations
would be identified during the rulemaking process after a review of data on water pollution from hazardous liquid
pipeline spills collected by agencies, such as the EPA, and as a result of the RSPA implementation of OPA 90. Placement
of a check valve on one side of a location and an RCV on the other side could reduce the number of valves that would require
remote control capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The location of valves would be proposed, as a result of this assessment, only to effectively reduce the amount of liquid
entering a body of water depending on the terrain, and would not necessarily be immediately located on either side
of the water crossing. For instance, valves placed immediately on either side of a water crossing would be effective
in reducing pollution only if the failure was in the water crossing, a rare occurrence according to anecdotal evidence.
Valves would only be effective in locations where the hazardous liquid pipeline operator has a SCADA-based leak detection
system so that each RCV can be closed soon after a failure is detected.

Valves in Urban Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The March 1991 EFRD study concluded that it was feasible from a benefit to cost standpoint to retrofit existing manually
operated block valves on hazardous liquid pipelines located in urban areas to RCVs and to install RCVs when installing
new valves in urban areas. An urban area is one which is not a rural area
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A proposal to require RCVs in urban areas would apply to hazardous liquid pipelines which have installed leak detection
systems, as the Department found in the March 1991 study that RCVs are effective only where leak detection systems
are installed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preceding 17 questions relate to the gathering of pipeline system operational data which can be answered only
by hazardous liquid pipeline operators. However, as stated earlier, the RSPA is also soliciting comments and ideas
from the nonregulated public including State agencies, trade associations, and environmental organizations.
The following 2 questions are directed to these members of the public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Question 18:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The RSPA is attempting to determine which critical locations should be protected from hazardous liquid pipeline
releases by the installation of EFRDs. From the locations listed below, please provide a ranking by probability with
a ranking of ``1'' representing the location which poses the greatest probability of combined safety and environmental
risk to the public. (Questions 18.10&hyph;18.12 are left blank for the commenter to specify locations of risk not
listed in questions 18.1&hyph;18.9.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document announces that the FHWA is considering proposing measures for reducing the incidence and severity
of collisions with large trailers during conditions of darkness or reduced visibility. Specifically, the agency
is considering issuing a proposal to establish requirements for the use of retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors
for certain trailers manufactured prior to December 1, 1993, the effective date of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's final rule on conspicuity for newly manufactured trailers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 10, 1992, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a final rule (49 CFR 571.108)
requiring that trailers manufactured on or after December 1, 1993, which have an overall width of 80 inches or more
and a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 10,000 pounds, be equipped on the sides and rear with means for
making them more visible on the road.

Trailer manufacturers may install either retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors. Manufacturers of retroreflective
sheeting or reflectors are required to certify compliance of their product with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
(FMVSS) No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108) whether the product is for use as original or as replacement equipment.

NHTSA Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NHTSA first requested comments concerning the use of reflective material to make heavy vehicles more visible
on May 27, 1980 (45 FR 35405). Forty-two comments were received, most of which favored the concept.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between 1980 and 1985, the NHTSA conducted a fleet study in which retroreflective material was placed on van-trailer
combinations in a manner designed to increase their conspicuity during conditions of darkness or reduced visibility.
The treatment of trailers consisted of outlining the rear perimeter, and delineating the lower side. No reflectorized
mud flaps were used. The study concluded that truck-trailer combinations equipped with this material were involved
in 15 percent fewer crashes (in which a trailer was struck in the side or rear) than combinations lacking the material.
A copy of the report, ``Improved Commercial Vehicle Conspicuity and Signalling Systems_Task III Field Test Evaluation
of Vehicle Reflectorization Effectiveness,'' September 1985 (DOT HS 806 923) is included in the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 18, 1987 (52 FR 35345), the NHTSA published a notice of request for comments. The notice presented results
of NHTSA's fleet study and sought comments on the test results as well as experiences motor carriers may have had with
the use of reflective material to enhance conspicuity. Thirty-seven comments were received, most agreeing that
a 15 percent reduction in accidents could be expected when all large vehicles were so equipped with reflective material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990 (sec. 15, Pub. L. 101&hyph;500, 104 Stat. 1218), the Congress included
a provision directing the Secretary of Transportation ``to initiate a rulemaking proceeding on the need to adopt
methods for making trucks or any category of trucks more visible to motorists *&blank;*&blank;*'' not later than
February 3, 1991, and to complete the rulemaking proceeding not later than November 3, 1992. On December 4, 1991, the
NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 63474. The NHTSA regarded its NPRM as responsive to
the congressional mandate and the final rule as the completion of the rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the issuance of the final rule, the NHTSA published the results of additional research on heavy vehicle conspicuity.
The purpose of the research program was to define a range of minimally acceptable large vehicle conspicuity enhancements
that could be used as a basis for revised Federal regulations. A number of laboratory and field studies were carried
out to assess the value of using a pattern in the marking material, the form the pattern should take, the placement of
the treatment on the trailer, the effect of retroreflective markings on the detection and identification of stop
and turn signals, and the trade-off between the width and retroreflective intensity of the treatment material. In
addition, field surveys were conducted to assess the effect of environmental dirt on the performance of the marking
systems and the durability of retroreflective materials when used on trucks.

The results of the research support the red and white pattern, retroreflective intensity and width of materials in
NHTSA's final rule. With regard to durability, the study indicated on page 166 that:

The typical service life of a trailer is estimated at 14 years. It would be desirable that retroreflective treatments
provide adequate performance for at least that long. The limited data collected *&blank;*&blank;* indicate that
it is possible to use retroreflective materials in a trucking environment and suffer very little, if any loss in performance
for ten or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years *&blank;*&blank;*. Until more definitive data are available, it is recommended that performance loss due
to aging be established at 80 percent retention over the fourteen-year period.

Relationship Between FHWA and NHTSA Requirements for Lamps and Reflective Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NHTSA is responsible for establishing manufacturing standards for motor vehicles. Manufacturers of motor vehicles
and certain motor vehicle equipment must certify that their products meet all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standards (FMVSSs). The standards for lamps and reflective devices are contained under FMVSS No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is responsible for establishing standards for commercial motor vehicles used in interstate commerce. Commercial
motor vehicles subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations must meet the requirements of 49 CFR Parts
393 (Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation) and 396 (Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance). Generally,
part 393 does not establish vehicle or equipment manufacturing standards per se, but rather establishes requirements
for certain equipment necessary for the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. The requirements for lamps
and reflective devices are contained under &sect;&sect;393.11 through 393.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements in &sect;&sect;393.11 through 393.26 are generally consistent with the manufacturing standards
in FMVSS No. 108. Manufacturers are required to equip newly manufactured commercial motor vehicles in accordance
with FMVSS No. 108. Commercial motor vehicles subject to the FMCSRs must be equipped with lamps and reflective devices
as required under part 393.

Current FMCSRs Requirement for Conspicuity Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 393.11 requires that all lighting devices on motor vehicles placed in operation after March 7, 1989, meet
the requirements of FMVSS No. 108 in effect at the time the vehicle is manufactured. Therefore, trailers manufactured
on or after December 1, 1993, the effective date of the FMVSS No. 108 requirement for retroreflective tape or reflex
reflectors, must have such reflective devices of the type and in the locations specified in FMVSS No. 108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA specifically requests comments that address the application of conspicuity requirements to trailers manufactured
before December 1, 1993. In a separate rulemaking, the FHWA will discuss maintenance and testing of conspicuity treatments
on trailers manufactured on or after December 1, 1993. The FHWA made a distinction between the two categories of vehicles
because the technical and economic issues associated with the consideration of retrofitting trailers with the conspicuity
treatment are much more complex than those associated with a requirement that motor carriers maintain the conspicuity
treatment with which the trailer was originally equipped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA requests that commenters address the specific issues below. However, the FHWA encourages commenters to
include a discussion of any other issues that the commenters believe are relevant to this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Many motor carriers have been using retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors which are not of the colors,
retroreflective intensity, width, or configuration of the conspicuity treatment in the NHTSA's final rule. The
FHWA seeks information on the type of conspicuity treatments in use and quantitative data on the cost and effectiveness
of those treatments in preventing and/or mitigating accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What types of technical problems (e.g., tape not adhering to the surface of the trailer) have motor carriers encountered
when applying conspicuity materials to in-service trailers? Are any problems unique to certain types of trailers,
or to certain types of paints, coatings, or surfaces? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What is the approximate cost (parts and labor) to apply conspicuity treatments to trailers? Is special training
required for employees performing this task? What cost differences may exist between having this task performed
by the motor carrier's own maintenance department or by third parties?

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. How long must a trailer be taken out of service to have the conspicuity material applied to its surfaces? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. With regard to conspicuity treatments that differ from those in the NHTSA final rule, a retrofitting requirement
could result in many motor carriers having to replace their current conspicuity treatments with one that is consistent
with the requirements of FMVSS No. 108. The FHWA believes that some form of conspicuity treatment (even certain forms
which may be less effective than that covered in the NHTSA's final rule) is better than no conspicuity treatment. What
different types of conspicuity treatment are currently being used by motor carriers? What results have been experienced
by motor carriers using conspicuity treatments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. If this rulemaking proceeds, should the FHWA propose requiring the same red/white color combination, retroreflective
intensity, width and configuration as the NHTSA's final rule, or should alternative requirements be considered?
If alternatives are considered, do commenters foresee problems in the enforcement of a retrofitting requirement?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If this rulemaking proceeds, should the FHWA consider an effective date which is several (2, 3, 4, or 5) years after
the date of publication of the final rule?

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) issues this proposed rule governing the Atlantic bluefin tuna (bluefin) fisheries
to: Establish fishing category quota allocations for the 1994 fishing season; amend the specified amount of other
species to be landed as a condition for landing an incidental bycatch of bluefin in the southern longline fishery;
adjust the line that separates the northern and southern regulatory areas for vessels using longline gear and possessing
an Incidental Catch permit for bluefin; make technical corrections to clarify the regulatory text; and request comments
on the use of curved length measurements to identify bluefin size classes and on additional means to provide notice
of fishery closures. This action is necessary to implement the recently adopted quota recommendation of the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to improve management and monitoring of the U.S. bluefin
fisheries, to facilitate enforcement, and to enhance collection of data to improve assessment of the impacts of the
fisheries.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The bluefin fisheries are managed under the implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 285, under the authority of the
Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. The ATCA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
to promulgate regulations as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations of ICCAT. The authority to implement
ICCAT recommendations is delegated from the Secretary to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA).

Purpose of Current Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action for the 1994 fishing season is limited in scope. It is intended to meet existing obligations to
implement ICCAT recommendations and to improve the efficiency of the domestic fishery management program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to ATCA requirements, action is currently needed to ensure that the 1994 ICCAT-recommended quota of 1,235
metric tons (mt) is not exceeded. Also, action is needed to adjust management measures for the 1994 fishery to improve
monitoring of bluefin tuna catch and facilitate enforcement. In addition, the proposed measures would enhance NMFS'
ability to meet the stated management objectives for the domestic fishery: provide data to monitor the stock, minimize
economic displacement, maximize the use of the resource, and spread fishing opportunity among as many users as possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would implement the ICCAT quota recommendation for 1994 and allocate the total quota among the
several permitted fishing categories. In addition, NMFS received input regarding proposed changes to the Incidental
Catch category from 13 scoping meetings held during September 13&hyph;17, 1993, and from written comments received
during the comment period that ended November 5, 1993. Commenters suggested various proposals, some of which were
adopted in the proposed measures and others that may be considered for future rulemaking. NMFS considered all comments
received during the scoping process while formulating this proposed rule. NMFS believes that these proposed changes
would further the management objectives for the domestic bluefin fisheries. NMFS also requests comments on the use
of curved length measurements to identify bluefin size classes and on additional means to provide notice of fishery
closures.

Fishing Category Quota Allocations for 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the November 8&hyph;12, 1993, meeting, ICCAT adopted a recommendation for new quotas for bluefin in the western
Atlantic. The total catch for the western Atlantic region for 1994 would be reduced by approximately 15 percent from
the 1992/1993 annual level to 1,995 mt. Despite this overall quota reduction, U.S. fishermen have been allocated
nearly the same amount of bluefin in 1994 (1,235 mt) as they were allocated in 1993 (1,248 mt). This results from Japan's
agreement to reduce its share of the total western Atlantic quota from its historical 26 percent to 12.5 percent during
1994 and 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS proposes to take the 13-mt reduction in the U.S. quota from the 31 mt reserve, thereby continuing or slightly modifying
the 1992/1993 quota allocations. The following quota allocations would be established for 1994: General category_531
mt; Harpoon Boat category_53 mt; Purse Seine category_301 mt; Incidental Catch category_southern longline subcategory
quota of 86 mt, northern longline subcategory quota of 23 mt, and ``other'' subcategory quota of 4 mt; Angling category_219
mt (no more than 99 mt of this quota may be school bluefin of which 47 mt may be landed south of 38
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;47
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude and 52 mt may be landed north of 38
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;47
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude). The Angling category quota for school bluefin is reduced from 100 mt to 99 mt because it is based,
per ICCAT recommendation, on 8 percent of the total U.S. quota (including reserve), which is lower for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also at the November 1993 meeting, ICCAT recommended a quota of 1,200 mt for the western Atlantic for 1995 (of which
U.S. fishermen would receive 743 mt). This reduction of over 50 percent from the 1991 western Atlantic quota is based
upon scientific assessments that indicate that present harvest levels are resulting in a decrease in the size of the
western Atlantic bluefin stock. The relatively higher 1994 allocation resulted from a 1-year provision to allow
additional time for scientific research, a review of data and methodologies used in the western Atlantic bluefin
stock assessment, and to reduce the short-term economic impact on fishermen. As a member of ICCAT, the United States
is obligated to adopt domestic regulations to comply with these recommendations. This proposed rule would establish
quota allocations by fishing categories for 1994 only. The quota reduction for 1995, being of greater magnitude and
likely to have significant impacts on the human environment, will be addressed in future rulemaking, which will include
preparation and public review of an environmental impact statement.

Change in Bycatch Conditions for Southern Longline Subcategory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1982, ICCAT recommended a ban on a directed bluefin tuna fishery in the Gulf of Mexico spawning area out of concern
for protection of the spawning stock. NMFS examination of available longline fishery data regarding discarded bluefin
in the Gulf of Mexico revealed that more than 80 percent of those bluefin released were dead. Thus, in the interest of
reducing waste, NMFS allowed landing of bluefin tuna but implemented longline fishery restrictions to preclude
directed harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a final rule dated January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8012), NMFS implemented an incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin
per trip in the area south of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; N. latitude and 2 percent by weight of all other fish on board per trip in the area north of that latitude. The reason
for the disparity in the catch limits between the two regions was that the 2 percent by weight limit was believed to be
unenforceable in southern ports due to the lack of weighing facilities in many areas where bluefin were landed. On
January 6, 1992 (57 FR 365), NMFS determined that the incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin per trip in the southern
area was not effective at reducing bluefin bycatch and changed the restriction for this area to one bluefin per trip,
provided the vessel landed, offloaded, and sold at least 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) of other species. NMFS believed that
the majority of trips directed at other species met or exceeded the threshold, making accurate weighing unnecessary
in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has received several comments indicating that the current bycatch restriction in the southern area is causing
an increase in bluefin discard and waste. Fishermen have reported that when a bluefin is caught early in a trip, they
are forced to continue fishing at the risk of deteriorating quality and price and at the risk of having to discard additional
bluefin in order to meet the target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Examination of 1993 domestic observer
data indicates that of 15 bluefin caught during observed trips, only four were retained (27 percent). Thus, reducing
the target catch requirement could lead to a reduction in bluefin mortality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS examined several options, none of which would change the allocation for the total longline bycatch. The options
that were discussed at the scoping meetings were: (1) Require special gear; (2) set a requirement of a minimum number
of days between a vessel's landings; and (3) revise the minimum target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Recommendations
also included prohibiting bluefin catches in the spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico or, conversely, to work through
ICCAT to rescind the prohibition and establish a limited directed fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special gear restrictions, such as breakaway leaders and circle hooks, are a management option, but further study
is required to define exact specifications and enforcement methods. NMFS considered setting a minimum number of
days between allowable landing of a bluefin by individual vessels but rejected this option because it could foster
a periodic directed fishery for bluefin while not necessarily eliminating the problems of bluefin bycatch on longline
trips directed at yellowfin tuna, swordfish, or sharks. NMFS also considered prohibiting the landing of bluefin
by longliners during the spawning season in the Gulf of Mexico but rejected this option because it would have precluded
retention of unavoidable bycatch that in many cases could not be released alive. NMFS also rejected a limited directed
fishery, which would be inconsistent with the ICCAT recommendation. Given the depleted status of the bluefin resource
and the significance of the Gulf of Mexico spawning grounds, NMFS does not consider a directed fishery to be warranted
at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS believes that requiring threshold amounts to be landed ensures that bluefin are harvested only as bycatch incidental
to fishing for other species. NMFS examined landings of Gulf of Mexico longline trips where no bluefin were taken to
determine if the current target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) is appropriate. The data indicate that for
years 1989 through 1991, the median values of landings for trips where no bluefin were sold were slightly above 1,500
lbs (680 kg) for the months of January through April, and about 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg) for the months of May through December.
Therefore, NMFS proposes to amend the minimum poundage requirement so that for the southern management area for the
Incidental Catch category one bluefin tuna may be landed per vessel per fishing trip, provided that for the months
of January through April at least 1,500 lbs (680 kg) and for the months of May through December at least 3,500 lbs (1,588
kg), either dressed or round weight, of species other than Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught, retained, and
offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer weighout as sold. This change should reduce waste and mortality
of bluefin tuna, while preserving the quality and value of legitimate bluefin bycatch that is landed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS believes it is possible to conduct directed fishing on species other than bluefin, with only a limited amount
of bluefin bycatch. However, if evidence indicates this is not true, NMFS may consider more stringent measures, such
as area or season closures or gear restrictions, in future rulemaking.

Adjust the Longline Incidental Catch Boundary Line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS proposes to move the 36
<!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;N. latitude line that separates the northern and southern longline fisheries to 34
<!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;N. latitude. Several comments were received requesting such a change. A traditional longline fishing area
off Cape Hatteras straddles the current line at 36
<!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;N. latitude. The current boundary, which is a very dynamic oceanographic regime, creates a problem because
of the uncertainty of drifts in the cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies and currents that occur in the area. Fishermen
may take bluefin in an open area and drift to a closed area, whereupon they are not able to land these fish because of the
prohibition on capture, retention, possession, and offloading of bluefin when an area is closed to fishing. NMFS
believes adjustment of the boundary line to 34
<!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;N. latitude is appropriate because this a less dynamic oceanographic environment close to shore with the Florida
Current located further offshore. This modification should reduce waste of fish and enforcement problems in this
area without increasing bluefin mortality. The total bluefin quotas for the northern and southern management areas
for incidental longline catch would remain unchanged by this adjustment.

Request for Comments Regarding the Use of Curved Length Measurements of Bluefin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS proposes to amend the regulations to include definitions of straight fork length, and curved fork length and
to clarify that straight length is the sole criterion for determination of bluefin tuna size class. Additionally,
NMFS proposes to amend the regulatory text regarding dealer reporting to clarify the existing requirements to report
weights and lengths of bluefin tuna purchased from fishermen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the size classes for bluefin are based on straight lengths (lengths taken along a straight line between
lines perpendicular to the body). If proper equipment is used, straight length provides a more accurate measurement
for bluefin than curved length (lengths taken along the curvature of the body) because of short-term variations in
the girth of the fish as a result of recent feeding rates. Frequently, however, calipers or similar instruments are
not available for measuring the straight length of bluefin. Measurements are often reported as curved length taken
with a tape measure held along the body of the fish. Illegal fish may be retained when commercial fishermen and recreational
anglers use curved length instead of straight length for determination of size classes and enforcement actions have
resulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is not proposing to define size classes in terms of curved length at this time. However, after analysis of length
data is completed, NMFS could amend the size-class definitions to make curved length an acceptable criterion for
determination of bluefin tuna size class. NMFS requests comments on the use of curved length in conjunction with,
or in place of, straight length for determining size classes of bluefin.

Request for Comments Regarding Additional Means To Provide Notice of Fishery Closures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current regulations, closures are announced via notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, with the closures generally effective some time after filing the notice. Fishermen who do not have access to these
notices may consult NMFS weekly catch reports, consult notices issued over the highly migratory species fax network,
listen for updates on NOAA weather radio, or call 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347 or 508&hyph;281&hyph;9260 for current
information. NMFS received comments during the 1993 fishing season that sufficient notice was not provided for all
closures. While existing regulations do not require advance notice of closure, NMFS recognizes the importance of
making every effort to notify the affected public as far in advance as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although NMFS endeavors to provide advance notice, quota monitoring is difficult when allowable catch levels are
small relative to the level of fishing effort. Based on current and historical catch rates, NMFS attempts to project
when quotas are likely to be reached for all fishing categories. While the overriding concern is to maintain catch
within each category's quota, it is also important that NMFS afford the maximum economic benefits to be gained from
full use of allocated quotas. Unfortunately, reliance on projected catch figures may result in premature closures
or short notification periods. Given the increasingly restrictive bluefin quotas in years 1995 and beyond, NMFS
anticipates that quota monitoring and notification of closures will become even more difficult. NMFS requests comments
on alternative means to provide notice of closures so as to minimize disruption to fishing activities and allow participants
to plan accordingly.

Technical Changes to the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS proposes two revisions to correct and clarify the regulatory text and to improve the effectiveness of management.
A technical revision to the regulatory text is proposed to omit obsolete references contained in &sect;285.31(a)(30).
Also, NMFS proposes to specify in &sect;285.31(a)(37) that, in order to retain fish less than 70 inches, vessels must
have an Angling category permit or must have taken the small bluefin pursuant to the incidental catch allowance of
the Purse Seine category fishery. This change is needed due to the implementation of the Angling category permit promulgated
in a prior rulemaking dated August 27, 1993 (58 FR 45286).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The AA has preliminarily determined that this proposed rule is necessary to implement the recommendations of ICCAT
and is necessary for management of the Atlantic tuna fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the
fishing category quotas proposed for 1994 will remain the same as current quotas. Also, the proposed changes to the
Incidental Catch category would alleviate some of the restrictions imposed on fishermen landing bluefin taken incidental
to longlining for swordfish, sharks and other tunas. These changes should facilitate enforcement of bluefin regulations,
would have a modest positive economic impact for some longline fishing trips and should help prevent waste of bluefin
tuna which would otherwise be discarded dead. Since the proposed changes would not significantly affect a substantial
number of small entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This proposed rule is not subject to
review under E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule involves a clarification of an existing collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act that has been approved by OMB (control number 0648&hyph;0239). This change, in reference to the daily
dealer report, clarifies the requirement to indicate the type of measurement recorded for bluefin tuna weights and
lengths. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3 minutes per response
for completing the requirement and faxing to NMFS. Send any comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect
of this requirement, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS and OMB (see

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total annual (January 1&hyph;December 31) amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed
or landed by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction in the regulatory area is subdivided as follows:

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or
landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the General category under &sect;285.21(b) is 531 mt, of which
65 mt is set aside for a late-season fishery beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 15. On the basis of the statistics referenced at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;285.20(b)(1), the Assistant Administrator will project a date when the catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will
equal the annual quota minus 65 mt, and will publish notification in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stating that fishing for, retaining, possessing or landing Atlantic bluefin tuna under the early-season quota must
cease on that date at a specified hour, and not recommence until September 15, whereupon a quota equal to the difference
between the annual quota and the estimated catch prior to September 15 will become available. If the Assistant Administrator
determines (based on dealer reports, availability of large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna on the fishing grounds,
and any other relevant information) that variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migration patterns
of Atlantic bluefin tuna, and the catch rate, may prevent fishermen in an identified area from harvesting their share
of the quota, the Assistant Administrator may set aside an allocation of the late-season quota for such area. The amount
of any allocation shall not exceed the greater of 20 mt or the maximum reported landings in the identified area in any
of the preceding 3 years. The Assistant Administrator will publish notification of any set-aside allocation and

any category, or as appropriate, subcategory, is not likely to take its entire quota as previously allocated for that
year. Given that determination, the Assistant Administrator may transfer, inseason, any portion of the quota of
any fishing category to any other fishing category or to the reserve after considering the four factors indicated
at paragraphs (f) (1) through (4) of this section, and the probability that any transfers between categories will
not result in the total quota being exceeded. The Assistant Administrator shall file a notification of transfer of
any inseason adjustment amount with the Office of the Federal Register before such transfer is to become effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of Atlantic bluefin tuna. For any Atlantic
bluefin tuna found with the head removed, it is deemed, for purposes of this subpart, that the tuna, when caught, fell
into a size class in accordance with the following formula: Total straight fork length equals pectoral fin straight
fork length multiplied by a factor of 1.35. For this purpose, all measurements must be taken in a straight line along
the middle of the lateral surface from a line perpendicular to the dorsal insertion of the pectoral fin of the beheaded
fish to a line perpendicular to the fork of the tail (PF, see Figure 1). The pectoral fin straight fork length will be
the sole criterion for determining the size class of a beheaded Atlantic bluefin tuna. Total straight fork length
will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of whole (head on) Atlantic bluefin tuna. Atlantic bluefin
tuna are deemed to fall into a size class according to the following table; approximate round weights are given for
illustrative purposes only.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS proposes regulations that would implement Amendment 25 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish
Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI). This amendment proposes to eliminate the primary Pacific
halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit that, when reached, requires NMFS to close Bycatch Limitation Zones
1 and 2H of the Bering Sea. NMFS also proposes regulations that would authorize the release of vessel-specific observer
data on bycatch of prohibited species, and prohibit the discard of salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI groundfish trawl
fisheries until each salmon has been counted by a NMFS-certified observer. This action is necessary for effective
management of the halibut PSC limit established for BSAI trawl fisheries and to provide better information on salmon
and other prohibited species bycatch. This action is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish
and other fish resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of
the BSAI and the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA and the BSAI is managed by the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the
BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act), and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and
675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action proposes regulations to implement Amendment 25 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. If approved
by the Secretary, this amendment would eliminate the primary halibut PSC limit established for BSAI trawl fisheries.
This action also proposes two regulatory amendments that would (1) authorize the release of vessel-specific observer
data on bycatch of prohibited species, and (2) prohibit the discard of salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI groundfish
trawl fisheries until each salmon has been counted by a NMFS-certified observer. A description of, and reasons for,
each of the proposed measures is presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Amendment 25 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 4,400-mt primary halibut PSC limit was established for specified BSAI trawl fisheries under Amendment 12a to the
FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (54 FR 32642, August 9, 1989). When the primary halibut PSC limit was reached,
Bycatch Limitation Zones 1 and 2H were closed to directed fishing for specified groundfish species. The intent of
this closure was to reduce halibut bycatch rates experienced by the trawl fisheries without prohibiting the groundfish
trawl fisheries access to the entire BSAI groundfish resource. When the secondary halibut bycatch limit established
under Amendment 12a (5,333 mt) was reached, the entire BSAI was closed to directed fishing for specified groundfish
species. A justification for and intent of the primary halibut PSC limit was discussed in the preamble to the final
rule implementing Amendment 12a. Amendment 12a expired December 31, 1990, and was superseded by Amendment 16 to the
FMP. Amendment 16 and its implementing regulations (56 FR 2700, January 24, 1991) maintained the primary and secondary
halibut PSC limits at 4,400 mt and 5,333 mt, respectively. Amendment 19 to the FMP maintained the primary halibut PSC
limit at 4,400 mt, but reduced the secondary limit to 5,033 mt. This adjustment was effective only for the 1992 fishing
year (57 FR 43926, September 23, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Amendment 19, the smaller difference between the primary and secondary halibut PSC limits frustrated NMFS'
ability to monitor the primary halibut PSC limit in a manner to allow closures before the secondary limit was reached.
As a result, trawl closures ensuing from halibut bycatch restrictions increasingly were implemented under the secondary
limit rather than the primary limit. This situation continues under Amendment 21 to the FMP, which superseded Amendment
19 and converted the primary and secondary halibut PSC limits established for trawl gear fisheries from catch limits
to mortality limits (3,300 mt mortality and 3,775 mt mortality, respectively) (58 FR 14524, March 18, 1993).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness of the primary PSC mortality limit to reduce halibut bycatch
rates for two reasons. First, the minor difference between the primary and secondary limits constrains NMFS' ability
to implement fishery closures under the primary limit before the secondary limit is reached. Second, observer data
on halibut bycatch rates do not indicate that closure of Bycatch Limitation Zones 1 and 2H under the primary limit necessarily
reduces halibut bycatch rates to allow more groundfish to be harvested before the secondary limit is reached. To the
contrary, closure of Zones 1 and 2H often increases bycatch rates by forcing fisheries to move to areas with lower groundfish
catch per unit of effort and higher halibut bycatch rates. Once the secondary limit is reached, the entire BSAI is closed
to directed fishing for specified groundfish species by vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear (50 CFR 675.21(c)(1)(iv)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To respond to these concerns, NMFS prepared a draft analysis for a proposed FMP amendment to eliminate the primary
halibut PSC limit. The draft analysis was reviewed by the Council and its Advisory Panel (AP) and Scientific and Statistical
Committee (SSC) during the Council's September 1992 meeting and adopted for public review. At its December 1992 meeting,
the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of the AP, SSC, fishing industry representatives, and
the general public on the proposed action to eliminate the primary halibut PSC mortality limit. The Council adopted
the proposed action under Amendment 25 to the FMP and requested NMFS to prepare a proposed rule to implement the action.
The action would not affect the secondary halibut bycatch mortality limit established for the BSAI trawl fisheries
(3,775 mt).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS prepare a proposed rule for review and approval that
would prohibit the discard of salmon taken in the BSAI groundfish trawl fisheries until a NMFS-certified observer
has counted each fish and collected any scientific data or biological samples that the observer had been requested
by NMFS to obtain. Regulations to prohibit the discard of all salmon taken in groundfish trawl operations until an
observer has counted each salmon would provide the opportunity to collect better data on salmon bycatch. These data
could be used to assess the quality of bycatch rate estimates derived from existing observer sampling procedures
and provide additional information with which to assess the magnitude of salmon bycatch in the Alaska trawl fisheries.
Additional data collected on salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI trawl fisheries also could be used to assess long-term
management measures that may be developed to address the salmon bycatch problem. Mandatory retention of salmon until
counted by an observer also would support independent industry initiatives to explore factors that may be correlated
with salmon bycatch and identify changes in fishing operations that could reduce salmon bycatch rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS concurs that additional information on salmon bycatch would be desirable and is necessary to develop management
actions to address the salmon bycatch problem in the Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries. Regulations implementing
the Council's request would require operators of vessels carrying observers whose fishing operation allows for
sorting of groundfish catch to sort all salmon from the groundfish catch and store the salmon in a separate bin or other
location on the vessel that allows the observer free and unobstructed physical access to each salmon for observation
and collection of scientific data or biological samples. Operators of vessels not carrying observers onboard or
whose fishing operation does not allow for sorting of groundfish catch for salmon must ice, freeze, or store in a refrigerated
saltwater tank all salmon taken as bycatch in trawl operations for delivery to the processor receiving the vessel's
groundfish catch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processors receiving groundfish from trawl vessels participating in a directed fishery for BSAI groundfish would
be required to retain all salmon delivered by each vessel during a weekly reporting period in separate bins marked
with the vessel's name and Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) fish ticket number(s) until a NMFS-certified
observer has counted each salmon and collected any scientific data or biological samples that are requested by the
NMFS Observer Program. Processors without observer coverage immediately available would be required to store all
salmon until a NMFS-certified observer is available to count each fish. Salmon must be stored at a location that allows
an observer free and unobstructed access to each salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS proposes to require vessel operators and managers of shoreside processing operations to designate a crew person
or employee who would be responsible for proper sorting, retention, and storage of salmon until a NMFS-certified
observer has notified the vessel operator or manager of the shoreside operation that the number of salmon and any biological
samples have been obtained. Upon the request of the observer, the designated crew person or employee also would be
responsible to help count salmon and take biological samples from retained salmon under the direction of the observer.
The intent of this proposed requirement is to support industry initiatives to obtain better data on salmon bycatch
and to facilitate the collection of these data in a manner that does not jeopardize the collection of other scientific
or catch data that NMFS-certified observers currently are required to obtain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processors without observer coverage would be required to freeze salmon until such time as an observer is available
to count retained fish. Some processors are never required to obtain an observer because their groundfish processing
operation never exceeds 500 metric tons (mt) during a single month. Mandatory retention would require these processing
operations to freeze salmon carcasses for an unknown period of time until an observer is obtained to count the fish.
Although not quantified, the associated costs to unobserved processing operations resulting from long-term storage
of salmon likely are unreasonable relative to the amounts of groundfish processed and corresponding salmon bycatch
that could be expected from the small amounts of groundfish delivered to these processing operations. Therefore,
NMFS proposes to exempt processors from mandatory retention of salmon during those months that the processor is exempt
from obtaining observer coverage under regulations implementing the Observer Program (50 CFR 672.27 and 675.25).
Currently, this exemption applies to mothership processors and shoreside processing facilities that receive less
than 500 mt of groundfish during a month.

All salmon, regardless of whether possessed at sea or at land-based processors, would be required to be returned to
Federal waters immediately with a minimum of injury regardless of condition, following notice by a NMFS-certified
observer that salmon have been counted and the collection of any scientific data or biological samples has been completed.
The discard of any salmon prior to notification by a NMFS-certified observer that salmon have been counted would constitute
a violation of regulations authorized under the Magnuson Act. Such violations would be subject to enforcement action

Observer data may be protected from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because it is considered

At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested NMFS to prepare a proposed rule that would authorize the release
of certain weekly observer data: The name and Federal permit number of each vessel participating in a directed fishery
for Alaska groundfish; the number of chinook salmon and other salmon species taken by each vessel; and the observed
bycatch rates of Pacific halibut, Pacific herring, king crab, and

Tanner crab of vessels participating in the BSAI or GOA groundfish fisheries. Members of the groundfish industry
have requested that vessel bycatch amounts or rates be made available in as timely a manner as possible to support independent
industry initiatives to address the bycatch problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further support industry initiatives to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates in the groundfish trawl fisheries,
members of the groundfish industry have submitted a separate request to NMFS for the release of additional observer
data on prohibited species bycatch in most BSAI and GOA groundfish trawl fisheries. NMFS believes that disclosure
of these observer data collected since 1992 could facilitate research by industry on salmon and other prohibited
species bycatch that hopefully would lead to more informed decisions by vessel operators on alternative fishing
practices to minimize bycatch rates of these species. These data would not be identified by vessel and would include
the following data for observed hauls in the trawl fisheries:

Representatives of the Alaska trawl industry have requested that the above observer data on specific hauls not be
released for vessels participating in the rockfish, Greenland turbot, or Atka mackerel trawl fisheries because
substantial competitive harm could result. These fisheries are conducted by a small number of vessels, involve relatively
small amounts of quota, and are geographically specific in nature. Releasing observer data on individual hauls could
effectively disclose commercial information of the current participants and cause them to suffer substantial competitive
harm. The rockfish, Greenland turbot, and Atka mackerel fisheries generally have low salmon bycatch rates and contribute
relatively little to the overall salmon bycatch amounts annually experienced in the Alaska trawl fisheries. Consequently,
excluding from disclosure the observer data collected onboard vessels participating in the rockfish, Greenland
turbot, or Atka mackerel fisheries is not anticipated to impair the effectiveness of industry initiatives to address
the salmon bycatch problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trawl industry representatives have not presented to NMFS concerns about the release of observer data that includes
vessel name and prohibited species bycatch amounts or rates or haul-specific observer data for groundfish fisheries
other than the rockfish, Greenland turbot, or Atka mackerel fisheries. Other participants in the groundfish fisheries
may perceive that the release of these observer data may cause substantial competitive harm to vessel operators,
owners, or other persons involved in the groundfish fishing industry because the disclosure of haul location and
depth data for these fisheries involves the release of traditionally closely held commercial information. Therefore,
the disclosure of observer data on prohibited species bycatch and associated haul location and depth information
could possibly be expected to divulge information on specific fishing operations in a manner that would result in
substantial competitive harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to a request for information under the FOIA, NMFS has determined that the disclosure of observer data for
vessel haul location and depth in the BSAI pollock and cod fisheries collected during 1993 is not reasonably expected
to result in competitive harm. This disclosure is based on the determination that trawl operations for pollock and
cod in the BSAI occur within fairly well demarcated areas that have consistently supported historic foreign, joint
venture, and domestic fisheries for these species. Given the established nature of these fisheries and the relative
concentration of fishing effort to known fishing grounds, NMFS does not expect that the release of haul position and
depth would result in the identification of unique fishing operations for pollock and cod that are not already known
by the participants in these fisheries. However, NMFS still is concerned about whether the conditions allowing for
the disclosure of observer data collected in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod fisheries will continue in the future.
Accordingly, NMFS has not exempted the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod fisheries from this proposed rule.

This proposed rule is in accordance with Department of Commerce regulations relating to the disclosure of commercial
or financial information (15 CFR 4.7(h)). Under these regulations, NMFS may disclose commercial or financial information
if (1) a notice of intent to disclose such information is adopted by NMFS pursuant to notice and public comment, (2)
NMFS specifies narrow classes of records submitted to it that are to be released under the FOIA, and (3) NMFS provides
in exceptional circumstances for notice when the submitter provides written justification, at the time the information
is submitted, that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive
harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with 15 CFR 4.7(h), in exceptional circumstances, vessel owners and operators may provide to the Regional
Director written justification at the time the observer data are submitted, or within a reasonable time thereafter
(such as 24 hours), that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive
harm. The Regional Director would consider objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining
whether to release the observer data. An example of an exceptional circumstance that would warrant Regional Director
consideration of observer data would be when fewer than three vessels participate in a particular trawl fishery during
a weekly reporting period and release of location or depth data for individual hauls observed onboard those vessels
would result in substantial competitive harm. Exceptional circumstances that would result in the nondisclosure
of observer data on vessel name and weekly bycatch amounts or rates of prohibited species have not been identified
by NMFS. Public comment is specifically encouraged on additional exceptional circumstances that may justify nondisclosure.

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has initially determined that this proposed rule is necessary
for the conservation and management of the groundfish fishery off Alaska and that, pending Secretarial approval
of Amendment 25, it would be consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RIR prepared for the proposed action concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have significant
impacts on a substantial number of small entities. A copy of this analysis is available from the Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Every vessel operator participating in the Alaska groundfish fisheries and every processor receiving BSAI groundfish
would be affected by the proposed action. Most operators of catcher vessels harvesting groundfish off Alaska meet
the definition of a small entity under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In 1992, 180 catcher vessels landed groundfish
from the BSAI. All these vessel operators would be affected by the preferred alternatives, particularly those that
participate in the pollock fishery (about 123 vessels). The economic impact on small entities under the proposed
action would not result in a reduction in annual gross revenues by more than 5 percent, annual compliance costs that
increase total costs of production by more than 5 percent, or compliance costs for small entities that are at least
10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent of sales for large entities.

in trawl operations for delivery to the processor receiving the vessel's groundfish catch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Processors receiving groundfish harvested in a directed fishery for groundfish using trawl gear must retain
all salmon delivered by each trawl vessel during a weekly reporting period in separate bins marked with the vessel's
name and ADF&amp;G fish ticket number(s) for each delivery until a NMFS-certified observer has counted each salmon
and collected any scientific data or biological samples from the salmon delivered to the processor by that vessel.
Processors without an observer present must store whole salmon in an iced or frozen state until an observer is available
to count each fish. Salmon must be stored at a location that allows an observer free and unobstructed physical access
to each salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Mothership processor vessels and shoreside processing facilities that are exempt from obtaining observer coverage
during a month under &sect;675.25 of this part or 50 CFR part 672.27 are exempt from mandatory retention of salmon under
this paragraph (c)(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Operators of vessels and managers of shoreside processing operations that are required to retain salmon under
paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section must designate and identify to the NMFS-certified observer onboard the vessel
or at the shoreside operation a crew person or employee to be responsible for sorting, retention, and storage of salmon
consistent with this paragraph (c)(6). Upon the request of the NMFS-certified observer, the designated crew person
or employee also is responsible for counting salmon and taking biological samples from retained salmon under the
direction of the observer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Salmon must be returned to Federal waters immediately with a minimum of injury regardless of condition, following
notice by a NMFS-certified observer that salmon have been counted and the collection of any scientific data or biological
samples has been completed.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the
countervailing duty order on ceramic tile from Mexico (58 FR 31505). We have now completed this review and determine
the total bounty or grant to be zero or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In addition, because we have determined that the following
companies have met the requirements for partial revocation from the order, the Department is revoking the countervailing
duty order with respect to these companies: Azulejos Orion, S.A., Ceramica Santa Julia, Eduardo Garcia de la Pena,
Jesus Garza Arocha, Ladrillera Monterrey, S.A., Pisos Coloniales de Mexico, S.A., Reynol Martinez Chapa, and Teofilo
Covarrubias.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 31505) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile
from Mexico (47 FR 20012; May 10, 1982). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance
with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by this review are shipments of Mexican ceramic tile, including non-mosaic, glazed, and unglazed
ceramic floor and wall tile. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule (HTS) item numbers 6907.10.0000, 6907.90.0000, 6908.10.0000 and 6908.90.0000. The HTS item numbers are
provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review covers the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991, sixty-one companies, and the following programs:
(1) FOMEX; (2) BANCOMEXT Financing for Exporters; (3) PITEX; (4) NAFINSA Long-term Loans; (5) Other BANCOMEXT preferential
financing; (6) CEPROFI; (7) import duty reductions and exemptions; (8) state tax incentives; (9) NAFINSA FONEI-type
financing; and (10) NAFINSA FOGAIN-type financing.

Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in the preamble
to 19 CFR 355.20(d) (53 FR 52306, and 52325; December 27, 1988). We calculated a country-wide rate, weight-averaging
the benefits received by the sixty-one companies subject to review to determine the overall subsidy from all countervailing
programs benefitting exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. Because the overall weighted-average
country-wide rate was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as defined by 19 CFR 355.7, we did not proceed any further in the calculation methodology.

Analysis of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from two respondents,
Ceramica Regiomontana and Ceramica Santa Julia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As in past reviews, Ceramica Regiomontana contends that the Department does not have the legal authority to impose
countervailing duties on ceramic tile from Mexico and must revoke the countervailing duty order. Effective April
23, 1985, the date of the ``Understanding Between the United States and Mexico Regarding Subsidies and Countervailing
Duties'' (the Understanding), Mexico became a ``country under the Agreement''. Therefore, Ceramica Regiomontana
argues that 19 U.S.C. 1671 requires an affirmative injury determination as a prerequisite to the imposition of countervailing
duties on any Mexican merchandise imported on or after April 23, 1985, regardless of whether the countervailing duty
order was published before or after the date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ceramica Regiomontana further contends that the Department's failure to revoke this order is inconsistent with
past practice. In two previous countervailing duty administrative reviews, Certain Fasteners from India; Final
Results of Administrative Review and Partial Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order (47 FR 44129; October 6, 1982)
and Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago; Preliminary Results of Changed Circumstances Administrative
Review and Tentative Determination to Revoke Countervailing Duty Order (50 FR 19561; May 9, 1985), where an outstanding
countervailing duty order was issued pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19 U.S.C. 1303(a) without benefit of an ITC injury determination, the Department determined that it did not have the
authority to impose countervailing duties when events subsequent to the issuance of the order required an affirmative
ITC injury determination prior to imposition of countervailing duties. Since the ITC has indicated that it does not
have the legal authority to conduct an injury investigation concerning merchandise already subject to a countervailing
duty order, the Department has in the past concluded that it could not impose countervailing duties and revoked, or
preliminarily determined to revoke, the order effective the date the affirmative injury determination became a
requirement. Therefore, the Department should revoke the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile and refund all
deposits of estimated countervailing duties by Ceramica Regiomontana during the 1991 review period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We fully addressed this issue in a previous administrative review of this countervailing duty order. See Ceramic
Tile from Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (55 FR 50744; December 10, 1990). The
U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) have sustained the Department's
legal position that Mexican imports subject to an outstanding countervailing duty order already in effect when Mexico
entered into the Understanding are not entitled to an injury test pursuant to section 701 of the Tariff Act and paragraph
5 of the Understanding (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, 879 F.2d 847 (Fed. Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 110 S. CT. 1318 (1989)). The countervailing duty order on ceramic tile
from Mexico was published prior to Mexico's entering into the Understanding, therefore, imports of ceramic tile
are not entitled to an injury test pursuant to section 701 of the Tariff Act. Ceramica Regiomontana has provided neither
new evidence nor new arguments on this issue.

Comment 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As in the last administrative review of ceramic tile, Ceramica Regiomontana contests the Department's determination
that BANCOMEXT and FOMEX loans taken out by the company were countervailable. The respondent contends that the use
of a commercial rate as a benchmark in the Department's calculation is inconsistent with Item (k) of the Illustrative
List of Export Subsidies annexed to the Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Item (k) of the Illustrative List defines an export subsidy as
the granting of export credits by governments at interest rates below the cost of funds to the government. BANCOMEXT
and FOMEX financing meets the cost to government standard and therefore do not provide countervailable subsidies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. Although FOMEX was examined in this administrative review, there were no outstanding loans under this
program during the review period. Therefore comments on this program are moot. With regard to BANCOMEXT, the Department
fully addressed this issue in the previous administrative review of this countervailing duty order. See Ceramic
Tile From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (57 FR 24247; June 8, 1992). The cost
to government standard which defines an export subsidy in Item (k) of the Illustrative List does not limit the United
States in applying its own national countervailing duty law to determine the countervailability of benefits bestowed
on merchandise exported from Mexico. See Certain Textile Mill Products From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing
Duty Order Administrative Review (54 FR 36841, 36843&hyph;36844; September 5, 1989) and Certain Textile Mill Products

(56 FR 12175, 12177; March 22, 1991). BANCOMEXT loans have been determined to be countervailable because they are
limited to exporters. Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Review (57 FR 5997, February
19, 1992) and Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Review (57 FR 24247, June 8, 1992). Furthermore,
when we compared our benchmark with the interest rates reported under the BANCOMEXT financing, we found countervailable
benefits. Ceramica Regiomontana has not provided any new evidence or arguments on this issue.

Comment 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As in past administrative review, Ceramica Regiomontana contends that the Department incorrectly treated the benefit
from the PITEX program as a grant and this overstated the company's net benefits. Ceramica Regiomontana claims that
after five years the company will have to pay the import duties and should be treated as an interest-free loan instead
of an outright grant.

Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We fully addressed this issue in the previous administrative review of this case. See Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Final
Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (57 FR 24247; June 8, 1992). Although exporters anticipate
re-export of machinery after five years under PITEX, an exporter may choose to keep the machinery as a permanent import.
It appears that after the five year period, any reimbursement made to the Mexican Government of import duties previously
exempted would not be significant. Therefore, duty exemptions under PITEX are properly treated as grants and we expensed
them in full at the time of importation, when the exporters otherwise would have paid duties on the imported machinery.

Comment 4:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ceramica Santa Julia contests the Department's determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order with respect
to them. Ceramica Santa Julia contends that they should be revoked because: (1) Ceramica Santa Julia met all regulatory
requirements for a company-specific revocation; (2) the administrative record contains sufficient evidence of
non-use of export subsidies by Ceramica Santa Julia; and (3) the administrative record contains sufficient evidence
that Ceramica Santa Julia will not apply for or receive countervailable benefits in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon further examination of Ceramica Santa Julia's record, we agree that the company should be revoked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of revoking a countervailing duty order in part pursuant to 19 CFR 355.25(a)(3), the Department's
current policy is that administrative reviews must be requested and conducted for each of five consecutive years,
with the year of request for revocation being the fifth consecutive year of review. See Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini,
Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Basis for Revocation of Individual Companies from Countervailing
Duty Orders under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19 CFR 355.25(a)(3) regarding Ceramica Santa Julia in the Countervailing Duty Administrative Review of Ceramic
Tile From Mexico, dated January 10, 1994. This is consistent with the Department's recently established policy for
revocation of countervailing duty orders in full pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19 CFR 355.25(a)(1), set forth in Roses and Other Cut Flowers from Colombia; Preliminary Results of Countervailing
Duty Administrative Review and Intent Not to Terminate Suspended Investigation (58 FR 52272; October 7, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Ceramica Santa Julia did not participate in the administrative review the year prior to it's request for
revocation, the Department chose to review whether Ceramica Santa Julia had met the minimum requirements for revocation
because the above-stated policy had not been clearly articulated prior to their revocation request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the unique circumstances in this case, the Department concludes that Ceramica Santa Julia has met the requirements
of &sect;355.25(a)(3) based on the following facts: First, both the Government of Mexico and Ceramica Santa Julia
have submitted certifications stating that the company had not applied for or received any net subsidy during the
review period and would not apply for or receive any net subsidy in the future; second, Ceramica Santa Julia has agreed
to the immediate suspension of liquidation and reinstatement of the order if the Department determines that subsequent
to revocation the company received a net subsidy; third, in the current review period, we verified the company and
found no evidence that they had applied for or received subsidies, and; fourth, the record shows that prior to the year
for which there was no review, Ceramica Santa Julia was found to have received no net subsidies in seven consecutive
reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these unique facts and circumstances, and because there was no clearly articulated policy detailing the
requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(a)(3), the Department has decided to revoke Ceramica Santa Julia. The Department finds
that under the current regulations, Ceramica Santa Julia clearly would have met requirements for revocation after
the seven consecutive reviews in which the Department found no receipt of subsidies. Furthermore, the eight years
of non-receipt of subsidies coupled with the company and government certifications of non-receipt are sufficient
evidence for a finding of no past subsidy receipt or no likelihood of receipt of subsidies in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for all companies for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, shipments
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this merchandise from all companies exported on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1991 and on or before December 31, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect cash deposits of zero estimated countervailing duties,
as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, on shipments of this merchandise from all companies entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice. This deposit requirement shall
remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we have determined that the following companies have met the requirements for revocation from the order:
Azulejos Orion, S.A., Ceramica Santa Julia, Eduardo Garcia de la Pena, Jesus Garza Arocha, Ladrillera Monterrey,
S.A., Pisos Coloniales de Mexico, S.A., Reynol Martinez Chapa, and Teofilo Covarrubias. We have determined that
these companies have not applied for or received any net subsidy for five consecutive years and they have filed the
certifications and agreement required by 19 CFR 355.25(b)(3). Based on the foregoing, we also determine that there
is no likelihood that these companies will apply for or receive any net subsidy in the future. Therefore, the Department
will instruct the Customs Service to terminate suspension of liquidation on entries from these companies and to liquidate,
without regard to countervailing duties, merchandise exported by these companies on or after January 1, 1992.

of school, the extent and role of homework, year-round professional opportunities for teachers, the use of school
facilities for extended learning programs, if appropriate a model for adopting a longer day or year, suggested changes
for state laws and regulations, and an analysis and estimate of the additional costs.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) to the New York University Medical Center (NYUMC),
Tuxedo, New York, under Grant Number DE&hyph;FG01&hyph;94EH89435. The DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial
assistance award. The purpose of the proposed grant is to support a one-year project during which NYUMC will generate
a comprehensive monograph on chelation therapy to be used in the case of nuclear accidents or major chemical spills.
This effort will have a total estimated cost of $89,023 to be provided by the DOE.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed grant will provide funding to NYUMC to generate a comprehensive monograph on chelation therapy to be
used in the case of nuclear accidents or major chemical spills. After completion of the monograph and the grant, the
DOE plans to print and distribute the monograph very widely and make it instantly available to the general public and
to any public national or international institution where radiation or chemical contamination may occur and is a
concern. This includes the general medical community, physicians specializing in nuclear medicine, local, state,
and Federal public health officials, power generating stations, universities, and major hospitals. The material
will be used not only as an emergency reference manual, but also for teaching purposes at teaching and training centers
such as the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS). This project is planned for a one-year
period of performance commencing on or about April 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project is meritorious because of its relevance to the accomplishment of an important public purpose_providing
a reference source for any physician treating any person who has been in an accident involving radionuclides or chemical
exposures. A prime example of this would be people exposed as a result of a nuclear leak or accident during transport
of an atomic weapon or of highly radioactive waste on public roads. This means that any member of the public could benefit
from this effort. The monograph will be a preventive measure to allow public institutions to deal rapidly and effectively
with such an accident, should one occur. In addition, the monograph will be used as a teaching source in universities
and medical schools training students on the methods used to treat radiation or chemical exposures. NYUMC is recognized
as a leading national training center in medicine with well recognized training programs in fields like environmental
health, radiation biology, and environmental pollution. NYUMC is one of the Nation's oldest and foremost centers
for research in the health effects of environmental pollution. NYUMC has the full-time faculty, supporting staff,
graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows to produce the monograph. The faculty is among the most knowledgeable
in the Nation in areas like biomarkers and the use of chelation for the treatment of radiation or chemical accidents.
The applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully, based upon experience and
technical expertise in chelation therapy as applied to nuclear accidents or major chemical spills. The DOE knows
of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the proposal
represents a beneficial method and approach to disseminate to the public information on chelation therapy.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the three applications for major license for the existing Rogers, Hardy, and Croton Hydroelectric Projects, located
on the Muskegon River in Mecosta and Newaygo Counties, in southwest Michigan, and has prepared a final Multiple Project
Environmental Assessment (MPEA) for the projects in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest
Service, Huron-Manistee National Forests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 8, 1993, a draft MPEA was issued and distributed to all parties, and comments were requested on the draft
MPEA to be filed within 45 days. All comments that were filed have been considered in the final MPEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final MPEA, the Commission and Forest Service staffs analyzed the site-specific and cumulative environmental
effects of the existing projects, as proposed in a Settlement Agreement reached between Consumers Power Company
and the state and Federal resource agencies. The Commission staff has concluded that approval of the applications
for new license, with appropriate enhancement measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the final MPEA are available in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Take notice that on January 4, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84158, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;170&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7(b)
of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for permission and approval to abandon approximately 7.7 miles of 10-inch pipeline and
a meter station in Grady County, Oklahoma, by transfer to Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), all as more fully set
forth in the application which is open to the public for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northwest proposes to abandon by transfer 7.7 miles of 10-inch pipeline and a meter station, known as the ``Mustang
Line,'' in Grady County to WNG. Northwest used the Mustang Line to transport residue gas from the outlet of the Conoco-Mustang
Processing Plant to WNG's 16-inch Cement Line; however, Northwest's gas purchase contracts with Conoco, Inc. and
NGL Production Company have expired. Northwest contends that the Mustang Line is located several hundred miles from
its mainline transmission system and uneconomical to continue to own and operate. WNG could operate the Mustang Line
as part of its system and provide shippers with access at the Conoco-Mustang Plant without incurring the additional
expense of contracting with Northwest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Northwest proposes to abandon the Mustang Line by a dividend at its net book value

 to The Williams Companies (TWC), the corporate parent of both Northwest and WNG, and TWC would make an immediate capital

Northwest states that WNG would operate the Mustang Line under its blank certificate authorization pursuant to subpart
F of part 157 of the Commission's Regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1986, Congress enacted the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Section 313 of EPCRA requires
certain businesses to submit reports each year on the amounts of toxic chemicals their facilities release into the
environment. The purpose of this requirement is to inform the public and government officials about releases of specified
toxic chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current reporting requirements apply to facilities in the manufacturing sector (Standard Industrial Classification
codes 20-39), that have 10 or more full-time employees, and that manufacture, process, or otherwise use 1 or more chemicals
on the section 313 list of toxic chemicals above certain thresholds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conjunction with expansion of the TRI reporting requirements, the Agency has been considering whether other adjustments
are needed in the scope of the TRI program. EPA received petitions from the Small Business Administration and the American
Feed Industry Association seeking an exemption for ``small sources'' (i.e., those facilities that file TRI forms
with zero or small release estimates). EPA previously put those petitions out for public comment and, on review, believes
there is substantial merit to the general concerns raised in the petitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is examining four options for establishing a small release exemption from the TRI reporting obligation: Cut-offs
at zero, 500 pounds, 1,000 pounds, and 5,000 pounds. EPA has developed a paper that presents findings from analyses
conducted on several low-release level options. This paper describes background information in greater detail
and issues related to exemption options being considered. Copies of this paper will be available on or before Monday,
January 31, 1994, from the address or telephone number listed under

 EPA has granted specific exemptions for the control of various pests to the 11 States as listed below and one quarantine
exemption granted to the California Environmental Protection Agency. There were also eight crisis exemptions initiated
by various States. These exemptions were issued during the months of July to September 1993, except for those in February,
1993, and are subject to application and timing restrictions and reporting requirements designed to protect the
environment to the maximum extent possible. EPA has denied a specific exemption request from the Idaho Department
of Agriculture. Information on these restrictions is available from the contact persons in EPA listed below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on peppers to control melon thrips. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part
166 was submitted as part of this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant states that the melon thrip has developed into a devastating pest in peppers since its discovery in Florida
in December 1990. The Applicant states that this pest has spread throughout Florida's lower east coast in less than
two years, and is expected to spread throughout the entire state within a few years. The feeding activities of melon
thrips cause damage to peppers by stunting growth, crinkling and deformation of leaves, shortening of internodes,
and deformation and scarring of fruit. The health of the foliage affects the plant's photosynthetic ability, ultimately
affecting yield. Deformation and scarring of the fruit can render the fruit unmarketable. The Applicant states that
melon thrips populations must be kept at manageable levels throughout the entire pepper season, and claims that registered
alternatives are not providing adequate control. The Applicant states that, if not adequately controlled, this
pest could cause yield losses of up to 100 percent, depending upon level of infestation. In a survey of pepper growers
in Palm Beach County, yield losses from this pest for the 1992-93 season were 40 to 100 percent, and translated to a dollar
value of over $5 million. The Applicant states that if comparable losses were to occur over the entire pepper-growing
range, losses could reach over $18 million state-wide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.5 lb. active ingredient (a.i.), or 32 fluid oz.
of product, per acre with one application allowed, on up to 20,000 acres of peppers. This amounts to a possible total
of 10,000 lbs. of a.i., or 5,000 gal. of product. This is the first time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid
on peppers. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing
section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a
new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides
for opportunity for public comment on the application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views
on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on apples to control aphids. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was
submitted as part of this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant states that aphids have been a chronic pest of apples in Washington. Aphids feed on the plant tissues
of young trees, which can stunt growth and possibly affect future productivity of the tree. On large, vigorous trees,
the primary concern is fruit damage. Aphids excrete such large amounts of honeydew that it drips on the fruit, causing
russetting or providing a substrate for the growth of sooty mold. The value of such damaged fruit is considerably reduced,
as it is diverted to a processing market. The Applicant states that some of the registered alternative pesticides,
while once effective, have lost much of their effectiveness due to build-up of resistant aphid populations. Others
are said to only provide suppression, and not adequately control aphids. One of the registered alternatives phosphamidon
that is still somewhat effective for this pest problem was withdrawn from the market in 1991, due to non-support for
re-registration, and existing stocks have been mostly depleted. Another chemical mevinphos was previously used
for this pest, but cases of occupational poisoning of farm workers using this material led to a ban for use on Washington
tree fruits, in 1993, because of human risk concerns. Therefore, the Applicant claims that Washington apple growers
are left without adequate means to control aphids. The Applicant states that information collected last year for
one sampling of apples indicated a 33 percent loss in crop value due to aphid damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active ingredient (a.i.), or 6.4 fluid oz.
of product, per acre with a maximum of 5 applications on up to 160,980 acres of apples, with no more than 0.5 lb. a.i. (32
fluid oz. of product) applied per year. This amounts to a possible total of 80,490 lbs. of a.i., or 40,245 gal. of product.
This is the first time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on apples. This notice does not constitute
a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice
of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not
contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides for opportunity for public comment on the
application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division
at the address above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Washington Department of Agriculture.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the fungicide, iprodione,
available as Rovral 4 Flowable Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 264&hyph;482) and Rovral Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 264&hyph;453)
from Rhone Poulenc Ag Company, to control target spot, caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rhizoctonia solani
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, on up to 940 acres of tobacco transplants in Georgia. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted
as part of this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Applicant, target spot became a statewide disease problem on flue-cured tobacco for the first time
in 1991. Under conditions conducive to disease development, the disease may cause serious losses in transplant beds
and field tobacco plantings. Growers who raise their own transplants could be faced with a shortage or complete lack
of planting material if a severe outbreak occurs, since other sources of planting material are generally not available
unless contracted for prior to the growing season. Also, the disease may spread to the field and cause tobacco yield
losses if transplants become infected. The Applicant claims that none of the registered pesticides is effective
against this disease and that, without an effective control, growers will incur a significant economic loss during
the 1994 growing season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications would be made under the proposed exemption at 0.5 to 1.0 pound of active ingredient per acre of transplants
in plant beds and greenhouses. Applications would begin when watersoaked spots first appear on leaves and be repeated
7 to 14 days later if conditions are favorable for disease development. A maximum of 3.0 pounds of active ingredient
per acre would be applied per year. Applications would be made between February 1, 1994 and May 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been requested
or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use has not been
submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(6)]. Exemptions for the use of iprodione on tobacco transplants have been
requested and granted for the past three years, and an application for registration of this use has not been submitted
to the Agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of the insecticide, imidacloprid, available as Admire 2 Flowable, from Miles Inc., to control
pesticide resistant Colorado potato beetle (CPB) on up to 30,000 acres of potatoes in Michigan. Information in accordance
with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. According to the Applicant, this emergency is the direct
result of severe insecticide resistance problems and the extreme population levels built up because of the growers'
inability to control CPB. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant states that year-to-year changes in weather and varieties make it difficult to track long term trends
in potato beetle injury. However, there is no visible increase in yields during this period in spite of major improvements
in average yield of new varieties and widespread increases in use of irrigation. Under current severe insecticide
resistance and defoliation by Colorado potato beetles, average production of potatoes per acre in Michigan has not
increased significantly in the past eight years. Losses plus control costs in 1993 were $10.53 million - more than
13 percent of the entire industry's expected gross profits. Under the proposed exemption, one application of Admire
2 Flowable would be made at the rate of 0.9 to 1.3 fl. oz. per 1,000 feet of row. This is equivalent to 13.8 to 20 fl. oz. of
formulated product per acre with 34 inches between the rows.

 FCC Form 701 is used when applying for additional time to construct a radio or satellite station. In addition to the
requirements contained in the form, applicants may be subject to other requirements contained in the Rules. FCC Form
701 is used by agency staff personnel to determine whether to grant the applicant's request for an additional period
of time to construct a station. The agency could not determine whether the applicant's request for additional time
should be granted without the information collection. Other showings may be necessary in addition to those specified
in the application form to comprise a complete filing. The form has been revised to include the certification required
by the Commission's rules implementing the provisions of section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.

Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Child Care and Development Block Grant (the Block Grant) program provides funds to States, Territories, and Tribal
Organizations to increase the affordability, availability and quality of child care services. Section 658E of the
Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (section 5082 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,
Public Law 101&hyph;508) requires lead agencies responsible for administering the Block Grant program to biennially
submit a plan to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The plan constitutes an agreement between
the grantee and the Federal government as to how the Block Grant program will operate within the area served by the grantee.
The plan also provides assurances that the program will be administered in conformance with the Act, pertinent Federal
regulations, and other applicable instructions or guidelines issued by the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preprint assists and guides lead agencies in submitting Block Grant plans. The plan preprint is arranged in five
sections: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 1_Assurances; Part 2_Lead Agency Responsibilities; Part 3_Child Care Services; Part 4_Activities to Improve
the Quality of Child Care and to Increase the Availability of Early Childhood Development and Before- and After-School
Services; and Part 5_Program Operations. The standardized format will ensure that complete program information
is submitted; provide usable information needed to compile and compare program data; and expedite timely reviews.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that a temporary permit has been issued to Bumble Bee Seafoods,
Inc., to market test products designated as ``Chunk Light Tuna with Jalapeno in Water'' and ``Chunk Light Tuna with
Jalapeno in Oil'' that deviate from the U.S. standard of identity for canned tuna (21 CFR 161.190). The purpose of the
temporary permit is to allow the applicant to measure consumer acceptance of the products, identify mass production
problems, and assess commercial feasibility.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 21 CFR 130.17 concerning temporary permits to facilitate market testing of foods deviating from
the requirements of the standards of identity promulgated under section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 341), FDA is giving notice that it has issued a temporary permit to Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc., P.O. Box
85362, San Diego, CA 92186&hyph;5362.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permit covers limited interstate marketing tests of canned tuna products formulated by adding chopped or diced
jalapeno peppers that have been previously prepared and packed in brine. The foods deviate from the U.S. standard
of identity for canned tuna in that the products contain diced or chopped green jalapeno peppers. The amount of jalapeno
peppers added will not exceed 10 percent of the water capacity of the can. Jalapeno peppers will replace part of the
liquid packing medium (water or oil) and will not affect the tuna fish fill portion. The test products meet all requirements
of the standard with the exception of this deviation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firm previously held a temporary permit for these products which expired on March 1, 1993. Notice of issuance of
the permit and a subsequent amendment of the permit were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 24, 1991 (56 FR 48212), and of July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32226), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA finds that issuance of the new permit is in the interest of consumers because it will provide for a wider variety
of tuna products and allow for collection of additional data in support of a petition to amend the standard of identity
for canned tuna.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this permit, the names of the products are ``Chunk Light Tuna with Jalapeno in Water'' and ``Chunk
Light Tuna with Jalapeno in Oil.'' The information panels of the labels will bear nutrition labeling in accordance
with 21 CFR 101.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This permit provides for the temporary marketing of 300,000 cases containing 24 cans of tuna with jalapeno peppers
in spring water and 400,000 cases containing 24 cans of tuna with jalapeno peppers in soybean oil, each can weighing
175 grams (6 1/8 ounces). The products will be manufactured at Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc., Santa Fe Springs, CA 90067,
and Bumble Bee International, Inc., Malecon Industrial Zone, Mayaguez, PR 00708. The products will be distributed
throughout the United States and its territories and possessions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the ingredients used in the food must be declared on the labels as required by the applicable sections of 21 CFR
part 101. This permit is effective for 15 months, beginning on the date the foods are introduced or caused to be introduced
into interstate commerce, but not later than April 19, 1994.

Part H, Public Health Service (PHS), chapter HA (Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health), of the Statement of
Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (42
FR 61318, December 2, 1977, as amended most recently at 58 FR 7140&hyph;41, February 4, 1993) is amended to reflect
changes in the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), as required
by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;43. Section 161 of the law amended
section 493 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. section 289B, in several respects. Specifically, section
493, as amended, requires that the ORI be an independent entity in DHHS and that the Director, ORI, report to the Secretary.
This revision accomplishes the statutory mandate while leaving ORI organizationally within the OASH for budget
and general administrative purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 8521(a)(2) of title 5 of the United States Code, the Secretary of Labor is required to issue from time
to time a Schedule of Remuneration specifying the pay and allowances for each pay grade of members of the military services.
The schedules are used to calculate the base period wages and benefits payable under the program of Unemployment Compensation
for Ex-servicemembers (UCX Program).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised schedule published with this Notice reflects increases in military pay and allowances which were effective
in January 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following new Schedule of Remuneration, issued pursuant to 20 CFR 614.12, applies to ``First Claims''
for UCX which are effective beginning with the first day of the first week which begins after April 2, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from December 23, 1993, through
January 6, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 615).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity For a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving

Description of amendment requests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would change the maximum nominal enrichment of the fuel allowed to be used in the reactor core.
Specifically, in Technical Specification 5.3.1, ``Fuel Assemblies,'' the fuel enrichment would change from ``a
maximum enrichment of 4.05 weight percent U-235'' to ``a maximum radially averaged enrichment of 4.30 weight percent
U-235 at any axial location.''

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The adequacy of a given core design must be demonstrated for each core prior to core reloading. The fuel
enrichment is only one of the factors that must be considered in this determination. The fuel enrichment does not directly
impact the results of the plant safety analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Unit 1, 2, and 3 fuel and storage areas have been analyzed for a maximum radially averaged enrichment of any axial
enrichment zone with a fuel assembly of 4.30 w/o U-235. The criticality analysis for Palo Verde's spent fuel pool is
presented in Section D.3, Criticality Safety Analysis. The results of these analyses indicate that handling and
storage of such fuel assemblies do not involve an unreviewed safety question. The results of these analyses are within
the acceptance criteria defined in TS 5.6.1, ``Criticality.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations and guides require that for spent fuel racks the maximum calculated k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, including margin for uncertainty in calculational method and mechanical tolerances, be less than or equal to 0.95
with a 95% probability at a 95% confidence level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure the true reactivity will always be less than the calculated reactivity, the following conservative
assumptions were made for spent fuel rack criticality analysis:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Pure, unborated water at 68 degrees Fahrenheit is used in all calculations,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- An infinite array with no radial or axial leakage is modeled, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Neutron absorption from spacer grids is neglected, i.e., replaced by water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the new fuel vault, a dual criteria applies in which the maximum calculated k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, including uncertainties, is less than or equal to 0.95 when flooded 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 less than or equal to 0.98 under conditions of ``optimum moderation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the new fuel vault is normally dry, and low density moderation of ``optimum moderation'' produces strong
coupling between assemblies, the following conservative assumptions are used:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The storage array was enclosed on all six sides by a tight fitting two foot concrete reflector,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Unborated water is introduced uniformly throughout the storage array and the space between fuel pins,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Water density is varied uniformly from flooded to dry,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Neutron absorption from spacer grids is neglected, i.e., replaced by water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the new fuel vault criticality analysis, leakage is explicitly modeled, because the assumption of an infinite
array with no radial or axial leakage is unrealistic under conditions of low density moderation. Leakage suppresses
criticality at low moderator density. Without 3-D modeling of the array, erroneously high values of k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 are calculated. Thus, the assumption on array leakage is relaxed, but reflection from the walls, floor and ceiling
is included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above discussion of the new fuel vault criticality analysis, the following conservative assumptions
are applied to both analyses:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- No credit is taken for the presence of burnable poison rods. These rods displace fuel rod positions and are an integral
part of selected fuel assemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- An upper bound for the fuel density was included in the nominal configuration of the fuel densities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The upper statistical bound of the fuel assembly enrichment, as based on the fuel fabrication specification, is
included in the statistical evaluation of uncertainties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criticality analysis of the Palo Verde new and spent fuel racks shows that the maximum radially averaged fuel enrichment
of any axial enrichment zone within a fuel assembly which meets the appropriate NRC limit with uncertainties is higher
than 4.30 w/o U-235.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a higher enrichment fuel cycle may result in fuel burnup consisting of a slightly different mixture of nuclides
and inventory, the effect is insignificant because the isotopic mixture and inventory of an irradiated assembly
is relatively insensitive to the fuel assembly's initial enrichment. Therefore, the doses from postulated accidents
are not significantly affected and continue to be acceptable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of Palo Verde with the proposed enrichment limit change will not create any new or different kinds of accidents
from those previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adequacy of a given core design shall be demonstrated for each core prior to reloading. The fuel enrichment is only

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuel handling and storage of fuel with radially averaged enrichment of any axial enrichment zone within a fuel assembly
of 4.30 w/o U-235 does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation performed for each reload core assures that the core design meets appropriate safety limits, including
a consideration of a significant reduction in the margin of safety. See response provided in Standard 1 for information
pertaining to the demonstration of the adequacy of each core design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

changes do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the FSAR accident analyses. Since the FSAR accident analyses
remain bounding, the radiological consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed

no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting
failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Also, there will be no change in the types or increase in
the amount of effluents released offsite. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not create the

Description of amendments request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an active participant in the industry-NRC improved Standard Technical Specifications (STS) implementation
effort, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&amp;E) volunteered to develop criteria for determining what requirements
are appropriate for inclusion in the Design Features section of the Technical Specifications (TSs), and to submit
a lead plant license amendment applying those criteria. This proposed license amendment justifies the adoption
of the ``Design Features'' section of the Combustion Engineering STS for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant and
then applies the developed criteria to the STS. The proposed criteria for determining what requirements should be
placed in the Design Features section of the TSs are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The amount, kind, and source of special nuclear material required;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The place of the use of the special nuclear material; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Those features of the facility such as materials of construction and geometric arrangements, which, if altered
or modified, would have an immediate and significant effect on safety and are not covered in the safety limits, limiting
conditions for operation or surveillance requirements of the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Design Features section is Section 5.0 for the Calvert Cliffs TS and Section 4.0 for the STS. Specifically, the
following changes are proposed to the Calvert Cliffs TSs and the STS for the Design Features section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 5.1 Site
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 contain maps of the site boundary and low population zones, respectively. These maps also
show the major structures, effluent release points, meteorological tower location, and the minimum exclusion area
radius. The STS requires inclusion of the site and exclusion area boundaries and the low population zone and allows
descriptions instead of maps. These maps or descriptions do not meet any of the criteria. However, Criteria 2 requires
that the place of use of the special nuclear material be described. BG&amp;E proposes to delete the existing Sections
5.1.1 and 5.1.2 and to create Section 5.1, entitled ``Site Location,'' and to include a text description of the location
of the site. The current information and maps in the sections will be relocated to the Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report (UFSAR). This change is also proposed for Section 4.1 of the STS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5.2 Containment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section does not meet Criteria 1, 2 or 3 in that modification of the containment would not create an immediate and
significant effect on safety. Furthermore, containment integrity is covered in the Limiting Conditions for Operation
and Surveillance Requirements sections of the TS. This Section is not included in the STS. BG&amp;E proposes to eliminate
it from the Calvert Cliffs Design Features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5.3 Reactor Core
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calvert Cliffs TS Section 5.3 and corresponding STS Specification 4.2.1 and meets Criteria 1, e.g., state the amount,
kind, and source of special nuclear material. For consistency with the STS, BG&amp;E proposes to adopt the STS titles
and wording.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5.3.3 Control Element Assemblies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calvert Cliffs Section 5.3.3, ``Control Element Assemblies,'' and the corresponding STS Section 4.2.2 does not
meet Criteria 1, 2 or 3. The safety significant aspects of control rods, e.g., the reactivity worth of control rods
and their required insertion times, are included in other portions of the TSs. Therefore, control rods do not fall
under the Criteria 3 as features not described in other sections of the TSs. BG&amp;E proposes that this section be
eliminated from the Calvert Cliffs Design Features and the STS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5.4 Reactor Coolant System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section does not meet any of the criteria and is not included in the STS. It does not meet Criteria 3 in that the requirements
on degradation, pressure, and temperature are contained in other portions of the TS and changes in the total water
and steam volume would not have an immediate and significant impact on safety. BG&amp;E proposes that it be eliminated
from the Calvert Cliffs Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 limit, and a maximum enrichment for fuel in the new fuel racks. These requirements are contained in STS Section 4.3.1.2,
Items a, b, c, and d. These sections meet Criteria 3, e.g., geometries which, if altered, would have an immediate and
significant impact on safety. These requirements do not appear in other sections of the TS. The STS language contains
the same restrictions as the Calvert Cliffs Design Features while introducing no new requirements. BG&amp;E proposes
adopting the STS language and we will add information on uncertainties of the referenced sections of the UFSAR.

Section 5.6.3 Drainage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section in the Calvert Cliffs Design Features section and the corresponding STS Section 4.3.2 does not meet any
of the criteria. It does not meet Criteria 3 in that it does not describe geometry or materials of construction and because
the requirements are contained in another portion of the TS. BG&amp;E proposes that this section be eliminated from
the Calvert Cliffs Design Features section and from the STS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5.6.4 Capacity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5.6.4, ``Capacity,'' states the maximum spent fuel storage capacity. This meets Criteria 1 in that it limits
the amount of special nuclear material that may be stored on site. The Calvert Cliffs TS language varies slightly from
the STS language in that it makes clear that the storage capacity limit applies to the combined storage pool for Units
1 and 2. Therefore, we propose to retain the Calvert Cliffs TS language.

1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the Design Features section adopts language from the Design Features section of the Standard
Technical Specifications (STS) for Combustion Engineering Plants (NUREG-1432, September, 1992), based on the
Commission's Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors (July
16, 1993). Some requirements in the current Technical Specifications have been eliminated or relocated to the UFSAR
based on the STS as evidence that the NRC no longer considers those requirements to meet the criteria for Design Features
in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(4). In some cases, we have proposed elimination of some requirements in the STS and the Calvert Cliffs
Technical Specifications based on a determination that they have no legal or regulatory basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose eliminating the ``Site'' sections, present in the Calvert Cliffs and the STS Design Features sections,
which contain maps or descriptions of the site boundary and low population zone. There are no legal or regulatory requirements
for including this information in the Technical Specifications and this information will be relocated to the UFSAR.
We propose adding a ``Site Location'' section which contains a description of the Calvert Cliffs location as required
by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [,as amended]. The ``Containment,'' ``Reactor Coolant System,'' ``Meteorological
Tower Location,'' and ``Component Cyclic or Transients Limits'' sections do not meet the legal or regulatory requirements
for inclusion in the Design Features section, are not included in the STS, and have been deleted. The information in
these sections is or will be contained in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. The ``Control Element
Assemblies'' and ``Fuel Storage - Drainage'' sections are included in the STS and Calvert Cliffs Technical Specifications
but eliminated in this change as these sections do not meet any of the legal or regulatory requirements for the Design
Features section. This information is contained in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. We propose
adopting the STS wording for the ``Reactor Core'' and ``Fuel Storage'' sections with no changes in the present limits
or controls. Some information in the Calvert Cliffs Technical Specifications is not contained in the STS ``Reactor
Core'' section. This information is contained in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All information eliminated from the Design Features section of the Technical Specifications is or will be located
in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. The design and operation of the plant have not changed. Therefore,
the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed change does not represent a change in the configuration or operation of the plant. All information eliminated
from the Technical Specifications will continue to be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. All legal and regulatory requirements
for the Design Features section continue to be met. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility
of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would extend existing plant surveillance intervals to 24 months from 18 months. This is the
third of three submittals and it changes specific setpoints to accommodate a 24 month fuel cycle and provides a justification
for extending the surveillance interval for those components and systems that are not related to instrument setpoint
changes.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This submittal results in changes to various equipment surveillance intervals and related instrument calibration
frequencies and setpoints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of lengthening the current 18 month interval to 24 months was evaluated and identified no significant system
or component degradation as a consequence of lengthening the interval to 24 months; therefore, systems and components
will continue to perform their design function. In some cases, the 24 month interval required setpoint changes to
ensure instrument drift associated with the extended interval would not result in exceeding an instrument's acceptable
setpoint tolerance. In other cases, justification of an extended interval was not developed because the surveillance
could be performed on-line. In these cases, the ``once/cycle'' surveillance requirement is changed to the currently
allowed 18 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes were developed using the guidance provided in Generic Letter 91-04 and Note 1 of Table 4.2.A through
4.2.G of Pilgrim's technical specifications. The proposed changes do not degrade the performance or increase the
challenges to the associated safety systems assumed to function in the accident analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of lengthening the current calibration/functional test interval from 1 to 3 months for certain components
was also evaluated. The evaluation used the guidance in Generic Letter 91-04 and Note 1 of Table 4.2.A through 4.2.G
of Pilgrim's technical specifications. No significant system or component degradation was identified as a consequence
of lengthening the interval to 3 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the availability of equipment or systems required to mitigate the consequences
of an accident, and do not affect the availability of redundant systems or equipment. The plant will continue to operate
within the limits specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR) and will continue to take the same actions if
setpoint limits are exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, both the proposed setpoint and non-setpoint changes do not significantly increase the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes with one exception, do not add or remove active components and, therefore, do not introduce failure
mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated. In one case, the EDG breaker time delay relays will
be replaced with more accurate relays to ensure the specified time sequence for starting and accepting the emergency
load remains within specification for the extended cycle. The replacement relays will be similar in size, weight,
voltage and temperature operating range as those being replaced; therefore, the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident is not created. In addition, the surveillance test requirements and the way surveillance tests are
performed will remain unchanged. Since the intended operation and function of the analyzed systems do not change
as a result of the setpoint and non-setpoint analyses, no new initiators are introduced capable of initiating an accident
that would render these systems unable to provide their required protection. Therefore, the proposed changes do
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed Technical Specification changes will result in an increase in the interval between surveillance
tests, the existing margins of safety are maintained through our proposed setpoint revisions. The proposed setpoint
changes either increase the plant safety margin or maintain the existing margin and do not significantly impact the
availability, performance, or intended function of the affected systems. In the case of non-setpoint changes, evaluation
of the affected systems indicates lengthening the interval to 24 months does not have significant impact on performance.
Therefore, the assumptions in Pilgrim's accident analyses are not impacted, and the proposed Technical Specification
changes do not significantly reduce the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment is a part of Commonwealth Edison Company's (CECo's) Technical Specification Upgrade Program
(TSUP) to improve the quality of the current Technical Specifications (TS) for Dresden and Quad Cities. The proposed
amendment would for both Dresden and Quad Cities, upgrade the requirements of Section 3.9/4.9, ``Auxiliary Electrical
Systems,'' to include operating and shutdown Limiting Condition(s) for Operation (LCO) and Surveillance Requirement(s)
(SR) that are consistent with the Standard Technical Specifications (STS) and later operating plant provisions.
Within the upgrade to Section 3.9/4.9, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) reliability provisions are added to implement
the recommendations of Generic Letter(s) 84-15 and 91-09; Information Notice(s) 84-69 and 91-62; and Regulatory
Guide 1.9, draft Revision 3. Other Generic Letters considered in the proposed TS include 83-26, 83-30, and 87-09.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the proposed changes represent the conversion of current requirement to a more generic format, or the
addition of requirements which are based on the current safety analyses. Implementation of these changes will provide
increased reliability of equipment assumed to operate in the current safety analyses, or provide continued assurance
that specified parameters remain within their acceptance limits, and as such, will not significantly increase the
probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the proposed changes represent minor curtailments of the current requirements which are based on generic
guidance or previously approved provisions for other stations. These proposed changes are consistent with the current
safety analyses and have been previously determined to represent sufficient requirements for the assurance and
reliability of equipment assumed to operate in the safety analyses, or provide continued assurance that specified
parameters remain within their acceptance limits. As such, these changes will not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.

A.C. Sources - Operating: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modifications for Section 3/4.9.A, ``A.C. Sources - Operating'', administratively incorporate the
requirements of STS, where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Stations. Most deviations from the STS requirements
are based upon generic guidance and other approved requirements at other sites. Dresden and Quad Cities Station are
retaining the current seven day allowed outage time from their current specifications for loss of an EDG. However,
an additional verification of EDG operability has been proposed for approximately midway through the seven day AOT.
The additional verification and additional details in the surveillances will significantly improve the overall
safety of both Dresden and Quad Cities Station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Dresden and Quad Cities Station's EDG history have shown them to be very reliable. This can be demonstrated by
the excellent pass/fail rate observed during the monthly surveillance tests. As stated previously, the addition
of several new STS enhancements to fuel storage and transfer requirements and other miscellaneous EDG surveillances
recommended by ASTM codes will improve EDG reliability. Therefore, because the EDG's for Dresden and Quad Cities
Station do not act as accident initiators, the probability of an accident previously evaluated for the sites is not
increased by the incorporation of the proposed requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other changes based upon STS guidance are more restrictive and limit operation of the site with respect to all A.C.
power sources. A.C. power sources do not act as initiators of accidents. Therefore, the probability of an accident
previously evaluated for the sites is also not increased by the incorporation of the STS requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of any previously evaluated accidents are not increased as more restrictions and limitations are
added to the current versions of both Dresden and Quad Cities specifications. The retention of the seven day allowed
outage times for the EDG's and the offsite power sources does not increase the consequences of any previously analyzed
accident for both sites as these are the current requirements. Therefore, the consequences of any previously evaluated
accident is not increased as a result of the proposed changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modification for Section 3/4.9.B, ``A.C. Sources - Shutdown'', administratively incorporate the
requirements of STS where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Station. The STS requirements add additional provisions
not in the current Technical Specifications for EDG fuel storage capability that will reduce the consequences of
a previously analyzed accident. The probability of any previously evaluated accident is reduced during shutdown
by the additional STS restrictions proposed for fuel handling type of activities. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident for
Dresden and Quad Cities Station.

D.C. Sources - Operating: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modifications for Section 3/4.9.C, ``D.C. Sources - Operating'', incorporate the requirements of
STS where applicable for Dresden and Quad Cities Stations. Dresden and Quad Cities are proposing to retain the current
provisions specified in the current version of Quad Cities Technical Specifications that allow the 125 and 250 VDC
systems to be out-of-service for a period up to 72 hours. This 72-hour AOT may be extended, when applied to the 125 VDC
systems, for up to a maximum period of 7 days with both units operating if the alternate 125 VDC battery is operable.
These changes introduce a difference when compared to the STS requirements. However, the STS requirements as applied
to Dresden and Quad Cities battery systems would prove to be overly burdensome requiring dual unit shutdowns to perform
most maintenance or testing activities. The additional batteries in the design of the stations, with their surveillances,
charger requirements, and breaker verifications, compensate for any STS deviations. The proposed requirements
are comparable to the existing requirements and AOTs for Quad Cities Station; therefore, the consequences of any
previously evaluated accident are not increased. The proposed changes add additional surveillance requirements
to the D.C. systems at Dresden and Quad Cities to enhance their reliability and operational readiness. This also ensures
the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased. Because the D.C. system is not assumed as
an accident initiator, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased.

The proposed modifications for Section 3/4.9.D, ``D.C. Sources - Shutdown'', administratively incorporate the
requirements of STS where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Station. The proposed changes add additional surveillance
requirements and more explicitly clarify the LCO's. The additional provision for fuel handling type of activities
reduces the probability of previously evaluated accidents from occurring. The additional surveillance activities
also improve D.C. reliability and thus, reduce the probability of D.C. system unavailability and hence, reduce the
consequences of previously evaluated accidents. Because the D.C. system is not considered as an accident initiator,
the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased.

The proposed modifications for Section 3/4.9.E, ``Distribution - Operating'', administratively incorporate
the requirements of STS where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Station. The proposed changes add additional
surveillance requirements and LCO's. The proposed requirements/actions for the D.C. distribution system are retained
to be consistent to the proposed AOTs for the D.C. system. The STS requirements as applied to the Dresden/Quad Cities
D.C. distribution system would prove to be overly burdensome, requiring plant shutdowns to perform maintenance
or testing activities. The additional distribution system surveillance and LCO's compensate for the STS deviations.
The proposed requirements are comparable to the existing requirements and AOTs for Quad Cities Station; therefore,
the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased. The additional surveillances and STS-type
requirements ensures the reliability and operational readiness of the Distribution System and ensures the consequences
of any previously evaluated accident are not increased. Because the Distribution System is not assumed as an accident
initiator, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased.

In general, the proposed changes represent the conversion of current requirements to a more generic format, or the
addition of requirements which are based on the current safety analyses. Others represent minor curtailments of
the current requirements which are based on generic guidance or previously approved provisions for other stations.
These changes do not involve revisions to the design of the station. Some of the changes may involve revision in the
operation of the station; however, these provide additional restrictions which are in accordance with the current
safety analyses, or are to provide for additional testing or surveillances which will not introduce new failure mechanisms
beyond those already considered in the current safety analyses. The retention of the current AOTs for EDGs, offsite
power sources, and DC systems maintain the existing assumptions from the current accident analyses; therefore,
these changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes for Dresden and Quad Cities Station's Technical Specification Section 3/4.9 are based on STS
guidelines or later operating BWR plants' NRC accepted changes. These proposed changes have been reviewed for acceptability
at the Dresden and Quad Cities Nuclear Power Stations considering similarity of system or component design versus
the STS of later operating BWRs. No new modes of operation are introduced by the proposed changes, considering the
acceptable operational modes in present specifications, the STS, or later operating BWRs. Surveillance requirements
are changed to reflect improvements in technique, frequency of performance or operating experience at later plants.
Proposed changes to action statements in many places add requirements that are not in the present technical specifications
or adopt requirements that have been used successfully at other operating BWRs with designs similar to Dresden and
Quad Cities. The proposed changes maintain at least the present level of operability. Therefore, the proposed changes

In general, the proposed changes represent the conversion of current requirements to a more generic format, or the
addition of requirements which are based on the current safety analyses. Others represent minor curtailments of
the current requirements which are based on generic guidance or previously approved provisions for other stations.
Some of the later individual items may introduce minor reductions in the margin of safety when compared to the current
requirements. However, other individual changes are the adoption of new requirements which will provide significant
enhancement of the reliability of the equipment assumed to operate in the safety analyses, or provide enhanced assurance
that specified parameters remain with their acceptance limits. These enhancements compensate for the individual
minor reductions, such that taken together, the proposed changes will not significantly reduce the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Technical Specification Section 3/4.9 implement present requirements, or the intent
of present requirements in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the STS. The proposed changes are intended
to improve readability, usability, and the understanding of technical specification requirements while maintaining
acceptable levels of safe operation. The proposed changes have been evaluated and found to be acceptable for use at
Dresden and Quad Cities based on system design, safety analyses requirements and operational performance. The retention
of the current AOTs for EDGs, offsite power sources, and DC systems maintain the existing assumptions from the current
accident analyses. Since the proposed changes are based on NRC accepted provisions at other operating plants that
are applicable at Dresden and Quad Cities and maintain necessary levels of system, component or parameter readability,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change will allow the use of specific steam generator tubing sleeves to repair Waterford 3 steam generator
tubes which exhibit degradation and can be sleeved (in the tube sheet crevice area and egg crate supports). The technical
specification change is proposed to reference the following reports [following NRC approval], which qualify the
use of steam generator tube sleeves as an alternative to tube plugging,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These reports demonstrate that the repair of degraded steam generator tubes using tube sleeves will result in tube
bundle integrity consistent with the original design basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sleeve design, materials, and joints were designed to the applicable ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Codes. Extensive
analyses and testing were performed to demonstrate the adequacy of the tube sleeves. The analyses were performed
using design and operating transient parameters which enveloped loads imposed during normal operating, upset and
accident conditions. Mechanical testing was performed to demonstrate leak resistance and joint strength, including
fatigue resistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corrosion testing was also performed to assess the corrosion resistance of the sleeve and joint. Based upon the results
of the analytical and test programs described in detail in the above mentioned reports, these tube sleeves meet or
exceed all the established design and operating criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utilization of tube sleeves not only reduces the risk of primary to secondary leakage in the steam generator, but can
also provide for more margin in the safety analysis. Sleeving a tube results in a primary flow reduction which has no
significant effect on the steam generator performance with respect to heat transfer or system flow resistance and
pressure drop. The cumulative impact of multiple sleeved tubes has been evaluated to ensure the effects remain within
the design bases. The installation of tube sleeves can be accomplished within the tube plugging analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the extensive analysis and test program performed and the ability to monitor and remove degraded sleeves
from service, this change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A sleeved tube performs the same function in the same passive manner as the unsleeved tube. Tube sleeves are designed,
qualified, and maintained under the stress and pressure limits of ASME Section III and Regulatory Guide 1.121. Eddy
current testing is performed following installation of each sleeve in order to verify the proper installation of
the tube sleeve and to obtain baseline eddy current data. This baseline data is used to monitor any subsequent degradation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the use of tube sleeves does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steam generator tube integrity is maintained under the same limits for sleeved tubes as for unsleeved tubes in accordance
with ASME Section III and Regulatory Guide 1.1.21. The degradation limit at which a tube is considered inoperable
remains unchanged and is detectable for sleeves as well as tubes. The technical specifications continue to require
monitoring and restriction of primary to secondary system leakage through the steam generators, such that there
remains reasonable assurance that a significant increase in leakage, due to failure of a sleeved (or unsleeved) tube,
will be detected. The slight reduction in reactor coolant system flow, due to sleeving, is considered to have an insignificant
impact on steam generator operation during normal operation and accident conditions and is clearly bounded by tube
plugging evaluations. The technical specifications will continue to contain reporting requirements for tubes
which have had their degradation spanned regardless of whether the tube is plugged or sleeved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to revise the Azimuthal Power Tilt limit
from less than or equal to 0.10 (10%) to less than or equal to 0.03 (3%) and to revise the action statement for control
element assembly (CEA) misalignment to allow 24 hours to restore the tilt to less than 3%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The additional time for recovery from a CEA misalignment is acceptable for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the safety analyses, this TS, places a limit on tilt for steady state operation as an initial condition
for the safety analyses. It is not a limit to be applied during transients. This is because accident analyses are initiated
from steady state conditions and are not required to assume a core power distribution transient simultaneous with
or immediately prior to the accident. This would in effect be two accidents occurring simultaneously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of having an accident immediately after a CEA drop during the 24 hour period allowed for tilt to be restored
to less than 3% is very low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification 3/4.1.3 addresses the CEA misalignments and requires a 30% power reduction within one hour
if the CEA cannot be restored to its proper position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing power as required in TS 3.2.3 action b.2 will tend to increase the azimuthal tilt, making the transient worse.
A lower power reduces the rate at which xenon near the dropped CEA can be burned out. Maintaining power will quicken
the process and keep the tilt as low as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional time is only allowed for a confirmed CEA misalignment which operators have procedures to respond to.
The change in tilt is expected and is not indicative of anomalous core power distribution behavior that might require
more immediate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change conservatively reduces the Azimuthal Power Tilt technical specification limit to agree with the assumptions
used in the safety analysis. The lower tilt represents a more even power distribution in the core. A CEA drop event may
temporarily cause the azimuthal power tilt to exceed the 3% limit. However, for the reasons identified above and since
the probability of having another event within the 24 hours allowed for recovery after the CEA drop is extremely low,
this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in technical specification limit on tilt does not involve any change to any equipment or the manner in which
the plant will be operated. This change will further restrict unevenness in the core power distribution. Therefore,
this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change incorporates an Azimuthal Power Tilt technical specification limit to agree with the assumptions
used in the safety analysis. Implementation of this change will preserve the margin of safety and be consistent with
the safety analyses. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Reactor Vessel material specimens withdrawal schedule will be removed from the Technical Specifications,
the Technical Specifications bases will continue to provide background information on the use of the data obtained
from material specimens. Also, updates to the schedule will continue to be submitted to the NRC for approval prior
to implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating the plant in accordance with the new, updated P-T Curves will assure preserving the structural integrity
of the reactor vessel over the life of the plant. The pressure and temperature limits were developed in accordance
with 10 CFR [Part] 50 Appendix G requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing the requirements associated with the previous exemption to Appendix H (TS 4.4.8.1.2 items a &amp; b) is purely
an administrative change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal of the Reactor Vessel material specimen schedule from the Technical Specifications has no impact on accidents
at the plant. Updates to the schedule will still be required to be submitted to the NRC prior to implementation per Section
II.B.3 of Appendix H to 10 CFR Part 50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, updates to the P-T Curves will not create a new or different type [of] accident. The reactor vessel beltline P-T
limits were revised applying the general guidance of the ASME Code, Appendix G procedures with the necessary margins
of safety for heatup, cooldown and inservice hydro test conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to TS 4.4.8.1.2 items a &amp; b is a purely administrative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal of the schedule for Reactor Vessel material specimen withdrawal from the Technical Specifications does
not impact the margin of safety. The schedule will continue to receive NRC review and approval prior to implementation
of updates to the schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Updates to the P-T Curves are provided to preserve the margin to [sic] safety to assure that when stressed under operating,
maintenance and testing the boundary behaves in a non-brittle manner and the probability of rapidly propagating
fracture is minimized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to TS 4.4.8.1.2 items a &amp; b is a purely administrative.

parameters into the COLR and the NRC-approved Babcock and Wilcox Fuel Company (BWFC) Topical Report BAW-10179P-A,
``Safety Criteria and Methodology for Acceptable Cycle Reload Analyses.'' The TMI-1 Cycle 10 COLR, submitted to
the NRC on November 7, 1993, includes these protective and maximum allowable setpoint limits and nuclear overpower
trip setpoints to support this Technical Specifications change.

1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment relocates
protective and maximum allowable setpoint limits from Technical Specifications, and design nuclear power peaking
factors and the maximum allowable local linear heat rate limit from Technical Specification Bases, to the TMI-1 Core
Operating Limits Report in accordance with NRC-approved Topical Report BAW-10179P-A. The proposed amendment provides
continued control of the values of these limits and assures these values remain consistent with all applicable limits
of the safety analyses addressed in the TMI-1 FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. The Technical Specifications
retain the requirement to maintain the plant within the appropriate bounds of these limits. Therefore, the proposed
amendment has no effect on the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment relocates protective
and maximum allowable setpoint limits, design nuclear power peaking factors and maximum allowable local linear
heat rate limit to the TMI-1 Core Operating Limits Report. The Technical Specifications retain the requirement to
maintain the plant within the appropriate bounds of these limits. Therefore, the proposed amendment has no effect
on the possibility of creating a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment provides continued control of the values of these limits and assures
these values remain consistent with all applicable limits of the safety analyses addressed in the TMI-1 FSAR. Therefore,
it is concluded that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.8.2, ``DC Sources,'' to delete two notes that indicate
that two 125-volt full capacity battery chargers are required when the Uninterruptible Power Supply is powered by
its backup DC power supply. These notes apply to the Divisions I and II DC sources during operating and shutdown conditions.
The licensee has determined that only one battery charger is required to meet current design requirements and the
criteria delineated in Regulatory Guide 1.32, ``Criteria for Safety-Related Electric Power Systems for Nuclear
Power Plants.'' The amendment would also revise TS 3/4.8.2 to increase the minimum allowable electrolyte temperature
for the 125-volt batteries from 60
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 65
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. This proposed change would establish consistency between the TSs, the Updated Safety Analysis Report, and
applicable battery capacity calculations. The amendment would also make administrative changes to TS 3/4.8.4,
``Electrical Equipment Protective Devices,'' and the TS Bases.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing ``notes'' at the bottom of pages 3/4 8-14 and 3/4 8-19 indicate that two (2) 125-volt full capacity chargers
are required when the Uninterruptible Power Supply is powered by its backup DC power supply. These ``notes'' were
based on an overly conservative calculation which determined that both chargers were required to supply adequate
power to connected loads including an Uninterruptible Power Supply. More recent calculations indicate that one
(1) charger is adequate to supply power to connected loads and an Uninterruptible Power Supply. Based on these more
recent calculations, Niagara Mohawk proposes to delete these ``notes.'' Because it has been determined adequate
power will be provided to connected loads with one (1) charger, deletion of these ``notes'' will not affect the reliability
of connected loads nor their ability to perform their intended function. Therefore, this change will not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Technical Specification 4.8.2.1 requires that the 125-volt batteries be demonstrated to be operable by
verifying that the average electrolyte temperature of one out of five connected cells is above 60
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The Nine Mile Point Unit 2 Updated Safety Analysis Report and current battery capacity calculations assume
a battery electrolyte temperature of at least 65
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The change from 60
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 65
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is conservative in that battery capacity is increased. Increasing the capacity of the batteries will not adversely
affect the reliability of connected loads nor their ability to perform their intended function. Therefore, this
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes made to Technical Specification 3/4.8.4 and to the Bases of Specifications 3/4.6.3 and 3/4.8.4 are administrative
changes and do not affect plant systems or operation. Accordingly these changes will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The function of the battery chargers is to provide adequate power to connected loads. Since it has been determined
that one (1) battery charger is sufficient to provide adequate power, deletion of these ``notes'' which require that
two (2) chargers be available does not affect the capability of the chargers to perform their function. The proposal
to change the required electrolyte temperature from 60
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 65
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F increases the capacity of the batteries and therefore improves the capability of the batteries to perform
their intended function. The remaining changes are administrative changes and do not affect plant systems or operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not introduce any new accident precursors and do not involve any physical alterations to plant
configurations which could initiate a new or different kind of accident. The changes do not adversely affect the design
or performance characteristics of the batteries, battery chargers or connected loads. The proposed change to increase
the required electrolyte temperature will increase battery capacity. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Niagara Mohawk proposes to delete the existing ``notes'' that indicate that two (2) 125-volt full capacity chargers
are required when the Uninterruptible Power Supply is powered by its backup DC power supply. Niagara Mohawk engineering
has determined that one (1) battery charger is adequate to meet the maximum DC load demands including the Uninterruptible
Power Supply. The proposed change to increase the required electrolyte temperature will increase battery capacity.
The remaining changes are administrative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes will not adversely affect the design or performance characteristics of the batteries, battery chargers,
or connected loads nor will they affect the capability of the batteries, battery chargers, or connected loads to perform
their intended function. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature. The proposed changes to TS VII.H.3 are consistent with 10 CFR
50.36a report requirements. The proposed changes do not affect accident evaluations. The proposed changes are administrative
in nature, should result in improved administrative practices, and do not affect plant operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature, do not result in physical alterations or changes to the operation
of the plant, and cause no change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These administrative changes do not alter the basic regulatory requirements and do not affect any safety analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS VII.H.3. does not alter any administrative controls over radioactive effluent, nor does
the proposed change involve any physical alterations to the plant with respect to radioactive effluents. Therefore,
the proposed change would not affect the meaning, application, and function of the TS requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment, by Portland General Electric Company, PGE or the licensee, would change the Trojan Nuclear
Plant (Trojan) Appendix A Technical Specifications to reflect the permanently defueled status of the facility.
The permanent cessation of power generation at Trojan and the May 5, 1993 amendment to the license which granted the
licensee a Possession Only License for the facility has rendered many of the existing provisions of the current Appendix
A Technical Specifications inappropriate. PGE has developed Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS)
for Trojan using NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants,'' as a basis for the PDTS
scope and format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided an analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
based upon the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment shows that the worst case design basis accident for this plant, in its permanently shutdown
defueled state, is a postulated spent fuel handling accident at the Trojan facility. The licensee has also identified
a second postulated design basis accident scenario, a loss of forced cooling to the spent fuel pool. Other Trojan Final
Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accident scenarios addressed in Chapter 15 are no longer applicable to Trojan in the
permanently defueled mode. The proposed amendment does not lessen any of the requirements associated with handling
spent fuel and therefore, the probability of a fuel handling accident occurring is unchanged. The licensee has analyzed
the a loss of forced spent fuel pool cooling accident and has shown that this scenario would not result in a radiological
release. The proposed amendment does not change the consequences of the accident since it does not affect the magnitude,
detection, or mitigation of either accident scenario. Additionally, the ability of the spent fuel pool to withstand
other applicable FSAR events, natural phenomena, and fires is either unchanged from the existing licensing basis
or is improved during the permanently defueled condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintaining the permanently defueled facility in accordance with the PDTS does not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any previously considered. Most of the existing plant systems and functions will
not be operational in the permanently defueled condition since power operations are prohibited and all of the fuel
at Trojan is stored in the spent fuel pool. However, all structures, systems and components that are necessary for
safe fuel handling and storage activities will be maintained operable during the permanently defueled condition.
The proposed PDTS provide operation and surveillance requirements and administrative controls which are sufficient
to ensure that the required structures, systems and components will be maintained operable in the permanently defueled
condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed PDTS are sufficient to ensure no reduction in a margin of safety, in part, because of the reduced range
of design basis accidents against which the facility must be protected now that the facility is prohibited from power
operations and is permanently defueled. Only a fuel handling accident or a loss of forced cooling to the spent fuel
pool are relevant during the permanently defueled condition. The margins of safety for both of these accidents will
remain the same or improve by maintaining the facility in accordance with the proposed PDTS. None of the other Chapter
15 FSAR accidents are applicable since power operations are prohibited and the facility is permanently defueled.
Additionally, the margins of safety for other applicable FSAR events, natural phenomena, and fires are either unchanged
from the existing licensing basis or are improved during the permanently defueled condition.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee has requested an amendment to the Technical Specifications (TS) to revise Section 3.3.D (Weld Channel
and Penetration Pressurization System) to allow certain portions of the Weld Channel Pressurization System (WCPS)
to be disconnected if they are determined to be inoperable and not practicably accessible for repair. The WCPS continuously
pressurizes channels over welds in the steel liner of the containment building. To be disconnected, an inoperable
portion of the WCPS must be covered by concrete such that repairs would involve removal of part of the containment structure
or the inoperable portion of the system is located behind plant equipment inside the containment building such that
repairs would involve relocation of the equipment. The licensee has requested this TS amendment since one portion
of the WCPS has become inoperable and, since it is buried in concrete below the containment floor, cannot be practically
repaired. In addition, administrative changes would be made to TS Section 3.3.B (Containment Cooling and Heat Removal)
and TS Section 3.3.E (Component Cooling System) to correct typographical errors. Specifically, TS Section 3.3.B.3.b
references 3.3.A.3 when is should reference 3.3.B.1 and TS Section 3.3.E.3.b references 3.3.A.3 when it should reference
3.3.E.1.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The consequences of an accident previously evaluated would not be affected by the disconnection
of portions of the WCPS [Weld Channel Pressurization System] because the accident analyses do not assume the operation
of any portion of the WC &amp; PPS [Weld Channel &amp; Penetration Pressurization System]. Additionally, operation
of the WC &amp; PPS is not taken credit for in any offsite accident dose calculations. The probability of an accident
previously evaluated would not be increased because the disconnection of any portion of the WCPS could not initiate
an accident. The administrative changes correct errors in the technical specifications and technical specification
bases. These administrative changes have no affect on the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The allowance for the disconnection of sections of the WCPS will allow the Authority [Power
Authority of the State of New York] to avoid repairs that can potentially degrade containment integrity or the condition
of vital equipment. The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new accident because the disconnection
of any portion of the WCPS could not initiate an accident. The administrative changes correct errors in the technical
specifications and technical specification bases. These administrative changes can not [cannot] create the possibility

(3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The allowance for the disconnection
of sections of the WCPS will allow the Authority to avoid repairs that can potentially degrade containment integrity
or the condition of vital equipment. The WC &amp; PPS will still provide continuous pressurization and monitoring
of leak-tightness for the zones incorporated into the containment penetrations and for at lease 80% of the channels
over the welds in the steel inner of the containment building. The WC &amp; PPS will continue to provide assurance that
the containment leak rate in the event of an accident is lower than that assumed in the accident analyses because the
accident analyses do not assume that any section of the WC &amp; PPS is operating. The administrative changes correct
errors in the technical specifications and technical specification bases. These administrative changes have no
affect on any margin of safety.

The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications for Salem Units 1 and 2 to incorporate the guidance
provided by the staff in Generic Letter 90-06 (GL 90-06) as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Specification 3/4.4.3 and 3/4.4.5 for Salem 1 and Salem 2, respectively, ``RELIEF VALVES'', will incorporate
the guidance of GL 90-06 with the following exceptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The surveillance requirement to test the emergency power supply for the power operated relief valves (PORVs) and
block valves has not been incorporated. The PORVs and block valves are powered from the emergency busses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The entry conditions for one or both PORVs inoperable will not be based on excessive seat leakage alone. Entry conditions
will be based on the capability of the PORV to be manually cycled consistent with the Action Statements contained in
NUREG-1431, Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. With both PORVs inoperable in Modes 1, 2, or 3 and not capable of being manually cycled, or both block valves are inoperable,
an allowed outage time of 6 hours to restore on block valve or PORV to operable status has been requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Specification 3.4.9.3 and 3.4.10.3 for Salem 1 and Salem 2, respectively, ``OVERPRESSURE PROTECTION SYSTEMS''
will incorporate the guidance of GL 90-06.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In addition to the guidance provided by GL 90-06, the following changes have also been proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For Salem 1, the reference to the specific American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) valve category would
be deleted from Specification 3.4.9.3.1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment
important to safety previously evaluated. This change will instill administrative restrictions on the Low Temperature
Overpressure Protection System and the PORVs thereby improving reliability and availability to respond to a Steam
Generator Tube Rupture and overpressure transient. The proposed amendment requires that power be maintained to
block valves that are closed should a PORV be inoperable, but still capable of being manually cycled. This change ensures
that the block valves can be opened on demand from the control room. Power is maintained to the block valves so that it
is operable and may be subsequently opened to allow the PORV to be used to control reactor pressure. The capability
to manually cycle the PORV is consistent with the Action Statement contained in NUREG-1431. This change actually
improves overall plant safety. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a procedural or physical change
to any structure, system or component that significantly affects accident/malfunction probabilities or consequences
previously evaluated in the UFSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The
proposed amendment does not involve any physical changes to plant structures, components, or systems. With the exception
of maintaining power to a block valve closed to isolate a PORV that is inoperable but capable of being manually cycled,
which does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident, the proposed change will not impose any
different requirements on plant operation. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new
or different accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes actually increase the overall
margin of safety by improving the availability and reliability of the PORVs and Block valves in response to Steam Generator
Tube Rupture events, and the PORVs in response to overpressure transients.

The proposed Technical Specification changes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes assure that existing safety limits are not exceeded due to changing Reactor Vessel conditions.
These changes reflect the latest material testing results per 10CFR50, Appendix H. Clearly defining the pressure
and temperature limits decreases the probability of nonductile failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No physical plant modifications or new operating configurations result from these changes. These changes do not
adversely affect the design or operation of any system or component important to safety, rather, they establish limits
to assure that operation remains within acceptable boundaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, no new or different accident from any previously evaluated will be created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capsule ``X'' analysis concluded that the Reactor Vessel has sufficient fracture toughness for continued safe operation,
providing operation remains within acceptable limits. The heatup and cooldown curves define these acceptable limits.
The proposed changes maintain existing margins of safety by modifying operating requirements based on specimen
Capsule ``X'' analysis. This analysis accounts for the actual chemistry data associated with the limiting weld,
rather than the previously used default values, thus providing some additional operating margin with no reduction
in the margin of safety. Actual weld chemistry data is specified in existing Technical Specification Table B 3/4.4-1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1) Operation of Farley Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing of model boiler specimens for free standing tubes at room temperature conditions show burst pressures as
high as approximately 5000 psi [per square inch] for indications of outer diameter stress corrosion cracking with
voltage measurements as high as 26.5 volts. Burst testing performed on pulled tubes with up to 7.5 volt indications
show burst pressures in excess of 5900 psi at room temperature. As stated earlier, tube burst criteria are inherently
satisfied during normal operating conditions by the presence of the tube support plate. Furthermore, correcting
for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength levels (as the burst testing was done at
room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the R.G. [Regulatory Guide] 1.121 criterion requiring
the maintenance of a margin of 1.43 times the steam line break pressure differential on tube burst if through-wall
cracks are present without regard to the presence of the tube support plate. Based on the existing data base this criterion
is satisfied with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes over twice the 2.0 volt interim repair criteria,
regardless of the indicated depth measurement. This structural limit is based on a lower 95 [percent] confidence
level limit of the data. The 2.0 volt criteria provides an extremely conservative margin of safety to the structural
limit considering expected growth rates of outside diameter stress corrosion cracking at Farley. Alternate crack
morphologies can correspond to a voltage so that a unique crack length is not defined by a burst pressure to voltage
correlation. However, relative to expected leakage during normal operating conditions, no field leakage has been
reported from tubes with indications with a voltage level of under 7.7 volts for a 3/4 inch tube with a 10 volt correlation
to 7/8 inch tubing (as compared to the 2.0 volt proposed interim tube repair limit). Thus, the proposed amendment does
not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, the accidents that are affected by primary-to-secondary
leakage and steam release to the environment are Loss of External Electrical Load and/or Turbine Trip, Loss of All
AC Power to Station Auxiliaries, Major Secondary System Pipe Failure, Steam Generator Tube Rupture, Reactor Coolant
Pump Locked Rotor, and Rupture of a Control Rod Drive Mechanism Housing. Of these, the Major Secondary System Pipe
Failure is the most limiting for Farley in considering the potential for off-site doses. The offsite dose analyses
for the other events which model primary-to secondary leakage and steam release from the secondary side to the environment
assume that the secondary side remains intact. The steam generator tubes are not subjected to a sustained increase
in differential pressure, as is the case following a steam line break event. This increase in differential pressure
is responsible for the postulated increase in leakage and associated offsite doses following a steam line break event.
In addition, the steam line break event results in a bypass of containment for steam generator leakage. Upon implementation
of the interim repair criteria, it must be verified that the expected distribution of cracking indications at the
tube support plate intersections are such that primary-to-secondary leakage would result in site boundary dose
within the current licensing basis. Data indicate that a threshold voltage of 2.8 volts would result in through-wall
cracks long enough to leak at steam line break conditions. Application of the proposed repair criteria requires that
the current distribution of a number of indications versus voltage be obtained during the refueling outages. The
current voltage is then combined with the rate of change in voltage measurement and a voltage measurement uncertainty
to establish an end of cycle voltage distribution and, thus, leak rate during steam line break pressure differential.
The leak rate during a steam line break is further increased by a factor related to the probability of detection of the
flaws. If it is found that the potential steam line break leakage for degraded intersections planned to be left in service
coupled with the reduced specific activity levels allowed result in radiological consequences outside the current
licensing basis, then additional tubes will be plugged or repaired to reduce steam line break leakage potential to
within the acceptance limit. Thus, the consequences of the most limiting design basis accident are constrained to
present licensing basis limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed interim tube support plate elevation steam generator tube repair criteria does not
introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which
could result in an accident outside of the region of the tube support plate elevations. Neither a single or multiple
tube rupture event would be expected in a steam generator in which the repair criteria has been applied (during all
plant conditions). The bobbin probe signal amplitude repair criteria is established such that operational leakage
of excessive leakage during a postulated steam line break condition is not anticipated. Southern Nuclear has previously
implemented a maximum leakage rate limit of 140 gpd [gallons per day] per steam generator on Unit 1. The R.G. 1.121 criterion
for establishing operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break
considerations to detect a free span crack before potential tube rupture. The 140 gpd limit provides for leakage detection
and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated
with the longest permissible crack length. R.G. 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits
are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with
the longest permissible crack is exceeded. The longest permissible crack is the length that provides a factor of safety
of 1.43 against bursting at steam line break pressure differential. A voltage amplitude approximately 9 volts for
typical outside diameter stress corrosion cracking corresponds to meeting this tube burst requirement at the 95
[percent] prediction interval on the burst correlation. Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to a voltage
so that a unique crack length is not defined by the burst pressure versus voltage correlation. Consequently, typical
burst pressure versus through-wall crack length correlations are used below to define the ``longest permissible
crack'' for evaluating operating leakage limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The single through-wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 1.43 times steam line break pressure differential
and steam line break conditions are about 0.53 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. Normal leakage for these crack lengths
would range from about 0.4 gallons per minute to 4.5 gallons per minute respectively while lower 95 [percent] confidence
level leak rates would range from about 0.06 gallons per minute to 0.6 gallons per minute, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operating leak rate of 140 gpd per steam generator has been implemented on Unit 1. This leakage limit provides for
detection of 0.4 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.6 inch long cracks at the lower 95 [percent] confidence
level and for three times normal operating pressure differential at less than nominal leak rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the implementation of interim plugging criteria will not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the interim tube support plate elevation repair criteria is demonstrated to maintain steam generator tube
integrity commensurate with the requirements of R.G. 1.121. R.G. 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the NRC staff
for meeting [General Design Criteria] 2, 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability of the consequences of steam
generator tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam generator
tubing, as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be removed from
service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence of outside diameter
stress corrosion cracking at the tube support plate elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture
event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The most limiting effect would be a possible increase in leakage
during a steam line break event. Excessive leakage during a steam line break event, however, is precluded by verifying
that, once the criteria are applied, the expected end of cycle distribution of crack indications at the tube support
plate elevations would result in minimal, and acceptable primary to secondary leakage during the event and hence
help to demonstrate radiological conditions are less than an appropriate fraction of the 10 CFR [Part] 100 guideline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin to burst for the tubes using the interim repair criteria is comparable to that currently provided by existing
technical specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing the combined effects of LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] + SSE [safe shutdown earthquake] on the steam
generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators
at some plants. This is the case as the tube support plates may become deformed as a result of lateral loads at the wedge
supports at the periphery of the plate due to either the LOCA rarefaction wave and/or SSE loadings. Then the resulting
pressure differential on the deformed tubes may cause some of the tubes to collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing
reduces the RCS [reactor coolant system] flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance
to flow of steam from the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase Peak Clad Temperature (PCT). Second,
there is a potential the partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube deformation
or collapse or that short through-wall indications would leak at significantly higher leak rates than included in
the leak rate assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, a detailed leak-before-break analysis was performed and it was concluded that the leak-before-break
methodology (as permitted by GDC 4) is applicable to the Farley Unit 1 [RCS] primary loops and, thus, the probability
of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural design basis
of the plant. Excluding breaks in RCS primary loops, the LOCA loads from the large branch line breaks were analyzed
at Farley Unit 1 and were found to be of insufficient magnitude to result in steam generator tube collapse or significant
deformation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of whether or not leak-before-break is applied to the primary loop piping at Farley, any flow area reduction
is expected to be minimal (much less than 1 [percent]) and PCT margin is available to account for this potential effect.
Based on analyses results, no tubes near wedge locations are expected to collapse or deform to the degree that secondary
to primary in-leakage would be increased over current expected levels. For all other steam generator tubes, the possibility
of secondary-to-primary leakage in the event of a LOCA + SSE event is not significant. In actuality, the amount of secondary-to-primary
leakage in the event of a LOCA + SSE is expected to be less than that currently allowed, i.e., 500 gpd per steam generator.
Furthermore, secondary-to-primary in-leakage for the same pressure differential since the cracks would tend to
tighten under a secondary-to-primary pressure differential. Also the presence of the tube support plate is expected
to reduce the amount of in-leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing the R.G. 1.83 considerations, implementation of the tube repair criteria is supplemented by 100 [percent]
inspection requirements at the tube support plate elevations having outside diameter stress corrosion cracking
indications, reduced operating leak rate limits, eddy current inspection guidelines to provide consistency in
voltage normalization, and rotating pancake coil inspection requirements for the larger indications left in service
to characterize the principal degradation mechanism as outside diameter stress corrosion cracking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, implementation of the tube support plate elevation repair criteria will decrease the number
of tubes which must be taken out of service with tube plugs or repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs
or tube sleeves would reduce the RCS flow margin, thus implementation of the interim repair criteria will maintain
the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced through increased tube plugging or sleeving.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in margin with
respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any bases of the plant Technical Specifications.

The proposed changes would modify the surveillance frequency of the auxiliary feedwater system pumps and valves
from monthly to quarterly. Various administrative changes are being proposed such as 1) punctuation and grammar,

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, operation of Surry Power Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes
will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps and valves does not significantly
affect the probability of occurrence or consequences of any previously evaluated accidents. The probability of
an accident occurrence is not increased in itself by the proposed changes in surveillance testing of the Auxiliary
Feedwater System pumps and valves. [A]uxiliary feedwater pump testing is performed through a full-flow test line,
thereby not affecting normal plant operations. Changes to the testing therefore do not affect the probability of
an accident occurrence. Redundant trains of the Auxiliary Feedwater System remain available during surveillance
testing, therefore, the consequences of an accident are unchanged by the proposed changes in the Auxiliary Feedwater
System surveillance test frequencies. Quarterly testing of the pumps and valves will continue to assure that the
Auxiliary Feedwater System is capable of performing its intended functions for either unit if called upon. Consistent
with Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements
for Testing During Power Operation,'' the new testing frequency should reduce Auxiliary Feedwater System unavailability
resulting from failures and equipment degradation during testing, thereby resulting in improved system reliability.
Invoking ASME Section XI as the acceptance criteria for testing the Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps is an enhancement to
the acceptance criteria presently specified. Furthermore, the operability requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater
System remain unchanged. Therefore, the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident are not
increased by the proposed changes in surveillance requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in test frequency and acceptance criteria for the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps and valves do not involve
any physical modification of the plant or result in a change in a method of operation. Quarterly testing of the pumps
and valves during both operation and shutdown will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be
capable of performing its intended function for either unit. Invoking ASME Section XI acceptance criteria for testing
the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps is an enhancement to the acceptance criteria presently specified. The operability
requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System remain unchanged. Furthermore, new or different failure modes
are not introduced by these changes in surveillance requirements. Therefore, a new or different type of accident
is not created by these proposed changes in surveillance requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance requirements of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps and valves does not affect any safety
limits or limiting safety system settings. System operating parameters are unaffected. This reduced pump and valve
testing frequency should reduce Auxiliary Feedwater System unavailability due to actual testing, as well as failures
and equipment degradation during testing. Thus reduced testing results in an improved system reliability. Quarterly
testing of the pumps and valves during operation and shutdown will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater
System will be capable of performing its intended functions for either unit. Therefore, the reduction in surveillance
testing requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps and valves does not reduce any margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by incorporating
technical and administrative changes to TS 4.5, Emergency Core Cooling System and Containment Air Cooling System
Tests; TS 4.7, Main Steam Isolation Valves; and Table TS 4.1-3, Minimum Frequencies for Equipment Tests. Changes
are proposed for the safety injection (SI) system automatic initiation test; the internal containment spray system
(ICS) flow blockage test; the SI, ICS and residual heat removal pumps' periodic tests; the main steam isolation valves'
test; and the periodic control rod functional test.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) TS 4.5.a.1.A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of an accident previously evaluated is not increased by the TS change. The changes do not affect any
structure, system, or component that initiates an accident analyzed in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR).
The probability of an accident occurring is independent of the availability of emergency core cooling components
used to mitigate an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be increased by this TS change. Revising the TS wording
to clarify that the pumps may be operated during the periodic surveillance tests does not decrease their availability
and therefore does not decrease their ability to mitigate the consequences of accidents previously evaluated in
the USAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clarifying the TS wording will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated in the USAR will not be created by this TS change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The automatic SI actuation is designed to respond to various events analyzed in the USAR which take credit for SI in
the event mitigation. The test required by TS 4.5.a.1.A verifies that the valves, pump circuit breakers, and automatic
circuitry receive the SI signal in the proper sequence. The procedural prerequisites for the performance of this
test ensure that an adequate flow path and overpressure protection are available for the pumps during the test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
It simply provides clarification that the pumps may start and operate in conjunction with the automatic circuitry
test; however, the pumps are not required to start and operate for this test. Therefore, the possibility or a new or
different accident from any previously evaluated is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the TS, i.e., verify each component receives the SI signal in the proper sequence, is not altered by this
proposed change. Clarifying that the pumps are allowed to operate during the performance of this surveillance requirement
does not adversely affect the ability of the surveillance to demonstrate system actuation. Therefore, this proposed
change will not reduce the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) TS 4.5.a.2.B
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change does not affect the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The ICS system is designed
to respond to various events analyzed in the USAR which take credit for spray for event mitigation. The probability
of an accident occurring is independent of the availability of containment air cooling systems used to mitigate an
accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change does not affect the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change allows
the use of surveillance methods that provide assurance of system capability to perform required design functions
in the event of an accident. The configuration of containment air cooling components used to mitigate the consequences
of accidents previously evaluated is not being changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated will not be created by this TS change. The proposed
changes do not alter the operation, function or modes of plant or equipment operation. Allowing the use of equivalent
surveillance methods does not create the probability of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change does not alter the intent of the specification. The use of equivalent test methods to demonstrate
component functionality does not reduce the margin of safety. The proposed change does remove a requirement to verify
100% (i.e. 168) of the installed nozzles are unobstructed; however, as noted in the safety evaluation, the original
system was overdesigned by approximately 5%. Verification of the number of required nozzles to satisfy design assumptions
is assured by the design requirements stated in the USAR. Since the minimum design requirements stated in the USAR
are demonstrated by surveillance, the margin of safety is not reduced. Consistent with Section 3.6.6A and associated
basis statements of NUREG 1431, ``Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications,'' Revision 0, performing surveillance
at ten year intervals assures the required number of spray nozzles are capable of functioning in the event of an accident.
Therefore, there is no adverse effect on public health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) TS 4.5.b.1.B
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not increase the probability of accidents previously evaluated. The probability of an accident
occurring is independent of the availability of the systems used to mitigate an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The consequences of
previously evaluated accidents requiring SI, RHR, and containment spray for event mitigation are independent of
the surveillance testing of these systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SI, RHR, and ICS pumps are designed to operate in response to various events analyzed in the USAR which initiate
on a SI or high-high containment pressure signal. The proposed change is intended to allow the use of full flow quarterly
testing for the ICS pumps and retain the existing quarterly mini-flow requirements for the SI and RHR pumps. Surveillance
testing verifies proper operation of the components and thereby ensures the consequences of the accident are consistent
with the evaluations of the USAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated will not be created by this TS change. The proposed
amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety will not be reduced by verifying the pump's performance through full flow testing or miniflow
testing. The intent of the TS, i.e. verifying no degradation of the ICS pump is satisfied by performing a full flow test
on a quarterly basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Administrative changes to TS Section 4.5
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent or interpretation of the TS. Therefore,
no significant hazards exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) TS Section 4.7
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of an accident previously evaluated will not be increased by this TS change. The MSIVs are designed
to limit the cooldown rate of the RCS and prevent structural damage to the containment, resulting from a SLB incident,
by closing to isolate the SGs. The probability of a SLB occurring is independent of MSIV operability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be increased by this TS change. This TS change allows
testing of the MSIVs when operating temperature and pressure conditions exist that are consistent with the conditions
under which the acceptance criteria were generated. The acceptable closure time for the MSIVs is not being modified
by this TS change, therefore the consequences of accidents relying on the closure of the MSIVs are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An evaluation of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) SLB analyses was performed. The existing core power and
reactor coolant system transient analyses assumed initial hot shutdown conditions for all cases analyzed since
this represents the most conservative initial conditions for the accident. The analysis of the containment pressure
transient also assumed initial hot shutdown conditions (at which time the steam pressure is highest and there is the
greatest inventory of water in the steam generator). The containment pressure analysis also conservatively delayed
the MSIV closures such that steam flow from both steam generators existed for the first ten seconds. It has been determined
that the proposed change in mode for surveillance testing is enveloped by the existing analyses, therefore the consequences
of an accident remained unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated will not be created by this TS change. The proposed
amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety will not be reduced by this TS change. Changing the plant conditions under which this surveillance
is performed does not alter the acceptance criterion for closure time. Changing the operating mode for the surveillance
test is based on engineering judgement which recognizes the importance of demonstrating the capability of the components
to perform in a steam environment.

(f) Table TS 4.1-3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change will not alter the intent of this specification which is to ensure that the control rods are operable
and capable of performing their safety-related function during a USAR analyzed event. Control rods fully inserted
into the core are already performing their safety-related function and therefore, by definition, are operable.
Revising the specification clarifies that the control rods fully inserted into the core need not be tested. Therefore,
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
Therefore, a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated will not be created by this TS change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rods which are fully inserted into the core are already performing their safety function and therefore, by definition,
are already operable. Exempting these control rods from a partial movement test will not reduce the margin of safety.

The proposed changes will add operating conditions and limiting conditions for operation to Section 15.3.6, ``Containment
System,'' of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant (PBNP) Technical Specifications (TS). This change also proposes revisions
to Sections 15.1, ``Definitions,'' and 15.4.4, ``Containment Tests,'' to support the changes to Section 15.3.6.
Additionally, the change will add explanatory text to the bases for Section 15.3.6 to support the revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions will add more specific limiting conditions for operation (LCOs) for containment isolation
valves, air locks, overall containment air leakage, and internal pressure. The proposed LCOs state more clearly
the requirements for operability and the actions to be taken if the requirements are not met. The proposed LCOs reflect
the intent of the Westinghouse Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1431. None of the existing LCOs
are being removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As most of the existing LCOs in Section 15.3.6 do not specify completion times for required actions, Section 15.3.0,
``General Considerations,'' applies. Section 15.3.0 states that if an LCO does not prescribe a time period, the affected
unit shall be placed in hot shutdown within three hours of discovering the situation. If the conditions which prompted
the shutdown cannot be corrected, the unit shall be placed in cold shutdown within 48 hours of discovering the situation.
The proposed revisions to Section 15.3.6 specify appropriate completion times for each LCO to eliminate the need
to default to the generic time requirements given in Section 15.3.0. If the required actions and associated completion
times are not met, the plant must be brought to at least hot shutdown within 6 hours and to cold shutdown within 36 hours.
The slightly longer time to hot shutdown is more than offset by the shorter time to cold shutdown, thereby reducing
the consequences of a release from containment. These times are reasonable, based on operating experience, to reach
the required plant conditions from full power conditions in an orderly manner without challenging plant systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

There is no physical change to the facility, its systems, or its operation. Therefore, there is no increase in the probability

There is no physical change to the facility, its systems, or its operation. Thus, a significant reduction in a margin
of safety cannot occur. In fact, by adding more specific LCOs for containment integrity and allowing for a more orderly
unit shutdown when required, an increased margin of safety may be realized.

at a similar unit (pressurized water reactor). The revision to the PSRC membership requirements replaced a list of
specific manager titles with a phrase designating managers responsible for certain technical areas.

The Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;71
and DPR&hyph;62 which authorize operation of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2 (BSEP or the facility),
respectively, at steady state power levels not in excess of 2436 megawatts thermal. The facility consists of two boiling
water reactors located at the licensee's site in Brunswick County, North Carolina. The Facility Operating License
provides, among other things, that BSEP is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (the Commission) now and hereafter in effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.A.5.(b)(2) of Appendix J establishes an acceptance criterion for the total measured containment leakage
rate, L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
am
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, measured at the peak containment internal pressure, P
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, calculated for the design basis accident. Since the periodic Type A tests at BSEP are conducted at P
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the acceptance criterion for these tests is that L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
am
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be less than 75 percent of the maximum allowable leakage rate, L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as specified in Technical Specification 4.6.1.2.b; this value is 0.5 percent by weight of the containment air per
24 hours. Section III.A.6(b) of Appendix J requires that, if two consecutive periodic Type A tests fail to meet the
criteria in section III.A.5.(b)(2), notwithstanding the periodic retest schedule of section III.D, a Type A test
must be performed at each plant shutdown for refueling, or approximately every 18 months, whichever occurs first,
until two consecutive Type A tests meet the criteria in section III.A.5.(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption would allow both BSEP units to return to a normal testing frequency so the next Unit 1 Type A test would
then be performed during the Reload 9 outage scheduled for March 1995 and the next Unit 2 test during the Reload 12 outage
scheduled for March 1997.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its letter dated October 19, 1993, requesting a one-time exemption from the schedular requirements of Section
III.A.6.(b) of Appendix J, the licensee stated that each unit is currently in an accelerated testing condition due
to as-found testing failures which, except for the 1987 Unit 1 test, were within L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 leakage limits but exceeded the current 0.75 L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 leakage limit of Section III.A.5.(b)(2) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50. The licensee has based its request on the fact
that the as-left limit of 0.75 L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was specified in Appendix J to provide a margin for possible deterioration of the containment leak-tightness during
the interval between Type A tests. The licensee states that this margin for deterioration is no longer needed when
the as-found Type A test is performed. The licensee believes that it should be technically acceptable to use L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the as-found Type A test acceptance criterion. The license provides further justification in that the Type A test
are normally terminated as soon as the acceptance criteria are satisfied for economic reasons. The licensee believes
that this process may result in leak rates that may not be indicative of actual primary containment leakage and that,
if the test durations were extended, the quantified leakage would be less than that reported to the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The as-found Type A condition is represented by the leakage rate calculated by adding the differences between the
as-found and as-left measured local leakage rates from each Type B and Type C test to the leakage rate measured in the
Type A test. These Type B and Type C tests are usually conducted prior to conducting the Type A test. In the event that
potentially excessive leakage paths are identified that would interfere with the satisfactory completion of a period
Type A test and such paths are isolated during the test, the Type B or Type C as-found leakage rates measured on the isolated
penetrations after the completion of the Type A test are added into the Type A as-found leakage rate total. The as-left
Type A condition is represented by the periodic Type A leakage rate after any required repairs and/or adjustments
are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff reviewed the history of the Type A tests conducted at BSEP and found that the last two Type A as-found test results
have been failures as noted below:

. The licensee indicated the 1987 Unit 1 failure was caused by a containment penetration failure identified during
the local leak rate testing. The licensee also stated the primary reason for failing the as-found limits is considered
to be the leakage savings additions from Type C testing of valves and the Type B testing of penetrations, where leakage
rates of repaired or replaced components are added into the integrated Type A test results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee stated the major contributors to the 1987 Unit 1 test failure were from (1) penetration X9A, Feedwater
Loop A Injection, and (2) penetration X54E, Containment Monitor, CAC&hyph;AT&hyph;1262, Discharge. The licensee
further stated the corrective actions to repair several valves associated with these penetrations were completed,
and if the leakage from these penetrations was not considered, the as-found leakage savings would have been 0.049%
wt. per day. For the 1991 Unit 1 Type A test, the majors contributors were stated to be (1) penetration X9B, Feedwater
Loop B Injection, (2) penetration X14, Reactor Water Cleanup (RWCU) Suction Line, and (3) penetration X10, Reactor
Core Isolation Cooling Turbine Steam Supply Line. These penetrations were repaired by the replacement or repair
of affected valves.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee stated that the major contributors to the 1991 Unit 2 test failure were from (1) penetration X220, Torus
Purge to Standby Gas, and (2) penetration X8, Main Steam Line Drain. The major contributors to the 1992 Unit 2 failure
were from (1) penetration X14, RWCU Suction, and (2) penetration X12, Residual Heat Removal Shutdown Cooling Suction.
The licensee conducted repairs to several valves to correct the leakage through each of these penetrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and basis and finds that there is adequate assurance that there will
not be any significant undetected degradation in the primary containment leakage during the next Type A test interval
in that the primary contributors to potentially excessive leakage paths will be measured during the required Type
B and Type C tests. These latter tests will be conducted at least once during each 18-month refueling outage, but in
no case at intervals greater than 2 years (Sections III.D.2 and III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff agrees that the subject exemption request does not pose any undue risk to the public health and safety in that
(1) the last as-left Type A test leakage rates were below 0.75 L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (2) the licensee will continue to demonstrate that the test results from the Type B and C local leak rate tests will
be no greater than their specified values in the Brunswick Technical Specifications prior to restart after a refueling
outage. Any potentially excessive leakage paths will continue to be repaired and/or adjusted prior to restart and
at intervals of 18 months, thereby continuing to ensure the integrity of the containment. Based on these considerations,
the staff concludes that the licensee's request for a one-time exemption to Section III.A.6(b) of Appendix J to 10
CFR part 50 will ensure compliance with the maximum permissible containment leakage rate specified in the Brunswick
Technical Specifications and, thus, should be granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption is authorized by law, will
not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The
Commission further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), are present justifying
the exemption; namely, that the application of this regulation is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose
of the rule. The underlying purpose of the rule is to provide a margin for possible deterioration of the containment
leak-tightness during the interval between Type A tests. The Licensee has provided adequate assurance, as set forth
above, that the underlying purpose of the rule will be achieved in that the primary contributors to potentially excessive
leakage paths will be measured during Type B and C testing. Further, the staff also finds that the protection provided
by the licensee against potentially excessive containment leakage will not present an undue risk to the public health
and safety. The application of the regulation is not necessary to assure the integrity of the containment in the event
of a postulated design basis loss-of-coolant accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission hereby grants the one-time exemption with respect to the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J,
Section III.A.5.(b)(2), to return both BSEP units to a normal Type A test frequency. Should two consecutive periodic
Type A tests fail to meet the criteria in section III.A.5.(b)(2) in the future, notwithstanding the periodic retest
schedule of section III.D, the licensee will be required to take the appropriate actions as specified in Section III.A.6(b)
of Appendix J to 10 CFR 50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of the subject exemption will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 1569).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Exchange is also adopting a new options floor brokerage fee that will be payable by clearing firms of $.015 per contract
side for all customer and non-market making member firm principal activity. The Chicago Board Options Exchange and

The Exchange is revising the fees it charges to members and member firms as outlined above in order to remain competitive
with other equity and options exchanges offering similar services.

The Exchange fee revisions are consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section

The proposed rule change filed by DTC consists of an increase of $187 million in the fixed net debit cap employed in DTC's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC employs a fixed net debit cap in its SDFS system in order to assure that DTC's liquidity resources are sufficient
to complete settlement if due to insolvency or, more likely, a temporary operational problem, an SDFS participant
were to fail to settle its net debit obligation.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The fixed net debit cap is set at 75% of: (1) the aggregate cash deposits to the SDFS participants fund and (2) DTC's internal
and external lines of credit. The cap is currently set at $387 million.

Each Participant's net debit is limited throughout the processing day by a net debit cap that is the lesser of: (1) the

debit cap.

DTC has on deposit approximately 72% of the commercial paper (``CP'') outstanding in the U.S. and expects that virtually
all CP outstanding in the U.S., except CP that is in direct issuers' proprietary book-entry systems, will be included
in DTC's CP program sometime in 1994. DTC plans to add other types of money market instruments (``MMI'') to its SDFS
system within the next year beginning with a new program for institutional certificates of deposit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC is concerned that with the anticipated increase in volume the fixed net debit cap at its current level could have
the undesirable effect of temporarily blocking substantial numbers of book-entry deliveries. In order to ease the
flow of transactions through the system, DTC has decided to increase its external committee line of credit by $250
million and thereby raise the fixed net debit cap that will be applied to the net debits of SDFS participants that elect
to share DTC's cost of obtaining the increased line of credit. At this time for twenty-two SDFS participants, the fixed
net debit cap is the operative cap limiting their net debits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DTC believes that the securities resources available to it to collateralize any borrowing it should have to make under
the increased line of credit are more than adequate.

DTC's line of credit agreement provides that any borrowing may be collaterlized by collateral securities in the account
of a failing participant as well as by securities that have been deposited by DTC participants to the SDFS participants
fund. On November 15, 1993, deposits to the SDFS participants fund included securities having a market value of approximately
$632 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder because it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

I. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal amends the MBS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at Article IV (Participants Fund), Rule 2 (Daily Market Margin Differential Deposits to Participants Fund), Sections
6 (Forms of Deposits) and 7 (Special Provisions Relating to Deposits of Cash). The proposed rule change also clarifies
MBS's existing rules regarding acceptable deposits of debt securities and letters of credit to MBS's Participants
Fund (``Fund'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. MBS Rules, Article IV, Rule 2, Section 6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, MBS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rules,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article IV, Rule 2, Section 6 require that deposits of debt securities to the Fund be valued at the lesser of their par
value or 100% of their current market value. MBS asserts that, in accordance with good financial practices, it should
value Treasury securities for purposes of the Fund only on a Current Market Value basis. MBS also states that the proposal
will help clarify valuation of securities deposits. Moreover, it is MBS' practice not to accept deposits of Treasury
securities that are within six months of their callable period in order to avoid any risk of loss due to a callable bond
trading at a premium being called at par.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. MBS Rules, Article IV, Rule 2, Section 7(b)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, MBS Rules, Article IV, Rule 2, Section 7(b), provided that MBS is not required to accept a letter of credit
as a deposit if, as a result of such acceptance, more than 25% of all Market Margin Differential Deposits to the Fund
(including deposits other than letters of credit) would consist of letters of credit by one bank or trust company.
The intent of this existing rule, and MBS's current policy is: (1) To reject such letters of credit if acceptance would
result in more than 25% of all Market Margin Differential Deposits
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 to the Fund (including all types of deposits) being in the form of letters of credit from one bank or trust company, and
(2) to minimize the risk of concentration in one bank or trust company of a substantial portion of letters of credit
deposited as Market Margin Differential. The proposed rule change clarifies the intent of the existing rule and reflects
MBS's current policy.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that this proposal is consistent with the Act, particularly Section 17A of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules be designed to promote,
among other things, the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding
of securities and funds within its custody or control or for which it is responsible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal permits Treasury securities in MBS' Participants Fund to be carried at 100% of their current market
value, in place of the current practice of carrying them at the lesser of their par value or 100% of their current market
value. MBS reports that its customers have requested the proposed single price determinant for valuing Treasuries
because, from the customers' perspective, it constitutes a more straightforward business practice and is less onerous
to apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the merits of this proposed change in the valuation of a major clearing margin asset, the Commission recognizes
that allowing MBS to value the Treasury securities at prices above par would add some market and interest rate risk
to MBS' valuation formula. But the Commission believes that the risk of this valuation change is manageable and acceptable
inasmuch as the Treasury securities in question: (1) will be limited to non-callable Treasuries, meaning there will
be no risk that a bond trading at a premium will be called at par; and (2) will be valued and marked-to-the-market by MBS
on a daily basis, meaning that the maximum marketplace risk exposure will be a one day price move.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also includes technical changes to MBS' practices concerning its Participants Fund. Among other things,
the proposal clarifies, with no change in meaning, MBS' standards for accepting letters of credit for deposits into
its Fund. In particular, the proposal clarifies a previously-approved MBS rule filing stating that no more than 25%
of the Participants Fund may consist of letters of credit from any one issuer.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes, therefore, that this portion of the proposal is not making any significant changes to existing
rules. The Commission believes that the 25% limitation is a prudent measure to safeguard against exposure to any one
financial institution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 6, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the NASD. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to authorize the waiver of member service
fees associated with the operation of the NASD's Intermarket Trading System/Computer Assisted Execution System
(``ITS/CAES'') for November and December 1993. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the
proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD is submitting this rule filing to authorize the waiver of member service fees associated with the operation
of the NASD's ITS/CAES for November and December 1993. Specifically, the service fees proposed to be waived are contained
in NASD's By-Laws, Schedule D, Part VIII, Section A.4.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule change reflects the NASD's determination to temporarily waive the collection of ITS/CAES service fees
for November and December 1993.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Such action has resulted from the positive financial and operational developments experienced in the equities marketplace
generally in 1993, including members' increased usage of ITS/CAES.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The waiver of ITS/CAES service fees for November and December of 1993 will maintain total revenue from ITS/CAES at
levels believed to be reasonable in relation to recovery of the development and ongoing operational costs associated
with the system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with and in furtherance of section 15A(b)(5) of the Act.
Section 15A(b)(5) requires that the rules of a national securities association provide for the equitable allocation
of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system
which the association operates or controls. By waiving ITS/CAES service fees for a limited two-month period, the
NASD believes that the total fees assessed for ITS/CAES usage by members will remain at levels sufficient to ensure
satisfaction of the statutory mandate that these fees be reasonably and equitably allocated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of

NASD. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change
if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Prior to December 8, 1993, applicant, formerly Integrated Cash Fund, an open-end management investment company
was a Massachusetts business trust. On July 8, 1986, applicant filed a notification of registration under section
8(a) of the Act. On July 9, 1986, applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and section
8(b) of the Act to register an indefinite number of shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share. The registration
statement became effective on January 6, 1987. Applicant commenced operations and the initial public offering of
its shares on September 23, 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On March 31, 1993, applicant's Board of Trustees approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Agreement'')
between applicant and SunAmerica Money Market Funds, Inc. (File No. 811&hyph;3807, formerly SunAmerica Money Market
Securities, Inc., ``SunAmerica''), providing for the transfer of substantially all of applicant's assets and liabilities
to SunAmerica Money Market Fund (the ``Acquiring Fund''), a separate investment series of SunAmerica, in exchange
for shares of the Acquiring Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act, at a joint meeting held on March 31, 1993, the Board of Trustees/Directors
of each of applicant and SunAmerica determined that participation in the reorganization was in the best interest
of the shareholders and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the reorganization.
These findings, and the basis upon which such findings were made, were recorded in the minute books of each investment
company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Proxy materials relating to the reorganization were filed with the SEC and distributed to applicant's sharedholders
on or about July 29, 1993. On September 23, 1993, a majority of applicant's shareholders approved the reorganization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The reorganization was effected pursuant to the Agreement at a closing held on September 24, 1993. Applicant distributed
in complete liquidation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to its shareholders of record as of the closet of business on September 24, 1993, the full and fractional shares acquired
in the exchange. The net asset value of Acquiring Fund shares received by applicant's shareholders was equal to the
net asset value of applicant's shares held by such shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No brokerage commissions were paid on the transfer of assets from applicant to the Fund. Expenses for effecting
the reorganization were borne by applicant and SunAmerica. Such expenses included preparation of proxy materials,
printing expenses, and legal and accounting fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. On December 8, 1993, applicant filed a Certificate of Termination of Trust with the Secretary of State of Massachusetts
business trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. As of the date of the application, applicant had no assets, liabilities, or shareholders. All liabilities and obligations
not discharged by applicant on or before September 24, 1993 were assumed by, and became the obligations of, the Acquiring
Fund. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administration proceeding.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Partnerships were organized as California limited partnerships. They are open-end investment partnerships,
allowing investors to purchase and redeem Partnership interests (the ``Units'') at net asset value on a monthly basis.
The Partnerships are not registered under the Act in reliance on section 3(c)(1) of the Act. The offerings of the Units
were structured as private placements under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Regulation D promulgated
thereunder. Units are sold to institutional investors and high net worth individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. TAMCO, a registered investment adviser and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The TCW Group, Inc., serves
as the sole general partner of each of the Partnerships, and has exclusive responsibility for the overall administration
of the Partnerships. TAMCO also has exclusive power and authority to manage and control the investments of each Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Company, a Maryland corporation, is a registered open-end investment company formed as a series company. Currently,
the Company offers six portfolios. The Company proposes to offer three new investment portfolios (the ``Funds''),
each of which will correspond to a Partnership in terms of investment objectives and policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Company has entered into an advisory agreement with the Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The TCW Group,
Inc., pursuant to which the Adviser will render investment management services to the Funds that are substantially
the same as the services that TAMCO currently renders to the Partnerships. The officers of TAMCO serving as portfolio
managers of the Partnerships also serve as officers of the Adviser and will serve as portfolio managers of the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants propose that, pursuant to an agreement and plan of exchange, each of the Funds acquire substantially
all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the corresponding Partnership in exchange for
Fund shares (the ``Exchange''). Fund shares received by the Partnership will have an aggregate net asset value equivalent
to the net asset value of the assets transferred by the Partnership (except for the effect of organizational expenses
paid by the Fund). Upon consummation of an Exchange, the Partnership will distribute the Fund shares to its partners,
with each partner receiving shares having an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value of the Units
held by such partner prior to the Exchange (except for the effect of organizational expenses paid by the Fund). Each
Partnership may retain assets needed to pay any accrued expenses. Each Partnership may also retain assets which the
applicable Fund is not permitted to purchase, or which would be unsuitable for the Fund. Any assets retained in excess
of amounts needed to pay the accrued expenses not transferred to the Fund would be distributed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to partners of the Partnership. Each Partnership will be liquidated and dissolved following the distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Each Partnership agreement of the Partnerships provides that the Partnership may be converted into a registered
investment company if the general partner determines that a conversion is in the best interest of the Partnership.
Each agreement expressly provides that no further approval or consent of the limited partners is required for such
conversion, so long as at least 60 days' advance written notice is provided to the limited partners. Limited partners
who do not wish to participate in the conversion of their Partnership will have adequate opportunity to redeem their
Partnership interests before the conversion occurs. As a result, no limited partner will receive shares in exchange
for his or her Units unless such limited partner determines to retain his or her investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Prior to an Exchange, certain limited partners may withdraw from the Partnerships and receive a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in-kind distribution for the purpose of investing in new limited partnerships that have similar investment strategies
and are expected to have a minimum investment of $1.5 million. Such limited partners include limited partners who
have made investments of a magnitude sufficient to qualify for advisory fees lower than those to be charged by the Funds,
limited partners with more than $1.5 million invested in any Partnership, and certain limited partners who would
encounter regulatory or other difficulties if they invested in a registered investment company. The new limited
partnerships will not be registered under the Act in reliance on section 3(c)(1) thereof, and the new partnership
interests will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on section 4(2) thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The expenses of each Exchange will be borne by TAMCO. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be
paid in connection with an Exchange. Fund organizational expenses, up to a maximum of $50,000 per Fund, will be paid
by the Funds and amortized over five years. Fund organizational expenses in excess of $50,000 per Fund will be paid
by the Adviser. Any unamortized organizational expenses associated with the organization of a Fund at the time the
Adviser withdraws its initial investment in the Company will be borne by the Adviser and not the Fund.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The management fees for the Funds will not exceed the maximum fees currently paid by the limited partners in each
corresponding Partnership. It is expected that other Fund expenses generally will be higher as a percentage of net
asset value than the expenses of a corresponding Partnership. This is primarily because of the increased operating
costs of a registered investment company and compliance with additional regulatory requirements. Through the end
of calendar 1994, however, the Adviser will limit annual Fund expenses with the intention of capping Fund expense
ratios at levels which would have been incurred during 1994 by the Partnerships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Funds' board of directors and TAMCO have considered the desirability of the Exchange from the respective points
of view of the Company and the Partnerships. All of the members of the board, including all of the independent directors,
and TAMCO have approved the Exchanges and concluded that: (a) The Exchanges are desirable as a business matter from
the respective points of view of the Company and the Partnerships; (b) the Exchanges are in the best interests of the
Company and the Partnerships; (c) the Exchanges are reasonable and fair, do not involve overreaching, and are consistent
with the policies of the Act; (d) the Exchanges are consistent with the policies of the Company and the Partnerships;
and (e) the interests of existing shareholders in the Company and existing partners will not be diluted as a result
of the Exchanges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Exchanges will not be effected until each of the following conditions is satisfied: the Company's registration
statement has been declared effective; the SEC has issued an order relating to the application; and the Company has
received a favorable opinion of counsel with respect to the tax consequences of the Exchanges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Exchanges will establish the Funds as the successor investment vehicles to the Partnerships. The Exchanges
will permit partners to pursue the same investment objectives and policies they were expecting from the Partnerships
as shareholders of the Funds without sacrificing the pass-through tax features of the Partnerships. In addition,
shareholders of the Funds will be able to purchase and redeem shares on each business day, as opposed to only once per
month as in currently provided under the partnership agreements. The Funds expect that operating as registered investment
companies will help encourage net asset growth.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(a) prohibits affiliated persons of a registered investment company, or affiliated persons of such
persons, from selling to or purchasing from such company any security or other property. Each Partnership may be an
affiliated person of the Company because TAMCO, the general partner of the Partnerships, and the Adviser, the investment
adviser of the Company, are under common control. Thus, the proposed Exchanges may be prohibited by section 17(a)
if they are viewed as principal transactions between the Company and the partners of the Partnerships, or between
the Company and the Partnerships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(b) provides for SEC approval of a proposed affiliated transaction that would be otherwise prohibited
by section 17(a) if the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable
and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction is consistent with the
policy of each registered investment company concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants believe that the proposed Exchanges meet the terms of section 17(b). They represent, among other things,
that the investment objectives and policies of each Fund are substantially similar to the corresponding Partnerships.
In addition, after the Exchanges, limited partners will hold substantially the same assets as Fund shareholders
as they previously had held as limited partners. In this sense, the Exchanges can be viewed as a change in the form in
which the assets are held, rather than a disposition giving rise to section 17(a) concerns.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed change adds the requirements for fly-by-light control systems. We propose to add two new paragraphs
to the ADC that cover concerns related to optical couplings and optical degradation. We do not consider loss of primary
flight controls critical to continued safe flight and landing in airships, because they essentially become free
balloons if they lose controllability.

background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for a control system not directly (mechanically) connected to the control surface are applicable
to both fly-by-wire and fly-by-light. The fiber optics used in fly-by-light systems, though immune to some of the
problems associated with fly-by-wire systems, has its own set of problems. Those problems are addressed in this change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approved. Based on information submitted by the public agency, the FAA has determined that the proposed class accounts
for less than 1 percent of the total enplanements at Corpus Christi International Airport.

Brief Description of Projects Approved-in-Part for Collection and Use:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) facility, communications, training center, and burn pit relocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Approved in part. The FAA has determined that the burn pit relocation/ARFF training facility portion of the project
does not enhance safety, security, or capacity, mitigate noise impacts, or furnish opportunities for enhanced competition
between or among carriers. The FAA is currently implementing a policy of funding only regional ARFF training facilities.
Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP) has not been designated as a regional ARFF training site by the FAA's Southwest
Region Airports Division.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Approved in part. The project elements to convert the public lobby to a USO/Chapel, construct new taxi shelters, expand
parking areas, and relocate sister city garden are not AIP eligible, nor do they meet PFC-specific eligibility for
gates and related areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
West apron cargo improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disapproved. The City states in the application that it is planning to finance this cargo building with local funds
but provides no further information, such as a construction schedule. Given that the justification for this project
is dependent on the cargo building, the FAA does not have sufficient information to approve the apron at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment storage facility and storage yard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disapproved. This project involves storage of maintenance equipment, areas for trade shops, and a central supply
yard for airfield and building maintenance use. This facility does not meet the requirements of section 158.15(b)(1)
and, therefore, this project is not PFC eligible.Loop road relocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disapproved. The financial plan for this project proposes using AIP discretionary funding for a majority of the project
costs. The FAA cannot commit to this level of discretionary funding at this time. The alternate funding plan was determined
not to be a viable plan. In addition, because the City was not required and did not provide a listing of alternative projects
to ensure that the PFC revenue is used on approved projects. Therefore, the FAA has no assurance that PFC revenue collected
for use on the subject project could be used on approved projects, in the event AIP discretionary funding were not provided.

Landside roadway reconstruction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disapproved. Section 158.33(a)(1) requires the public agency to begin implementation of a project no later than
two years after receiving approval to use PFC revenue on that project. Therefore, all projects approved in this application
must begin implementation no later than November 1995. The schedule submitted with the application shows an implementation
date of June 1996 for this project.

Determination:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Approved in part. This project is eligible under Airport Improvement Program (AIP) criteria. Sources of financing
for a portion of this project include an existing AIP grant. However, the remainder of the project also requires AIP
funding, which the FAA is unable to commit to at this time. Also, that portion of the project which is not included in
the existing AIP grant was not included in the description of the project provided to the air carriers during airline
consultation. The city of Long Beach has not provided evidence to demonstrate that the carriers have had the opportunity
to comment on that portion of the project not currently under grant. Therefore, the approved amount corresponds to
that portion of the project already under AIP grant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disapproved. The FAA has determined that this project does not enhance safety, security, or capacity, mitigate noise
impacts, or furnish opportunities for enhanced competition between or among carriers. Therefore, this project
is not PFC eligible. The ARFF training facility has been reviewed under AIP criteria (paragraphs 301b and 500 of FAA
Order 5100.38A), which permits projects to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The FAA is currently implementing
a policy of funding only regional ARFF training facilities. Long Beach Municipal Airport has not been designated
as a regional ARFF training site by the FAA's Western-Pacific Region Airports Division.

Discussion of Proposed New Special Purpose Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 21, &sect;21.25 provides for issuance of type certificates approving specific
special purpose operations for aircraft in the restricted category. Examples of special purpose operations for
which restricted category type and airworthiness certificates may be issued are listed in FAR &sect;&sect;21.25(b)(1)
Through (b)(6). Authority to specify any other special purpose operation is reserved by the FAA Administrator in
FAR &sect;21.25(b)(7). Advisory Circular (AC) 21&hyph;17 states that the only operations falling within the restricted
special purpose category are those items specifically listed in FAR &sect;21.25(b) (1) through (6), ``plus further
categories established under (b)(7) after public notice and comment procedures.'' The FAA defines restricted category
Operations in FAR &sect;21.25(b) as agricultural (spraying, dusting, seeding, and livestock and predatory animal
control); forest and wildlife conservation; aerial surveying (photography, mapping, and oil and mineral exploration);
patrolling (pipelines, power lines, and canals); weather control (cloud seeding); aerial advertising (skywriting,
banner towing, airborne signs and public address systems); and any other operation specified by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has approximately 50 years of experience in approving restricted category type certificates and flight operations
for aircraft and uses that are in the public interest, but that cannot be accomplished in standard category aircraft
(normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter, or transport). Restricted category certificates are issued when an aircraft
is not eligible for standard category certification as configured for a particular special purpose operation. Historically
special purpose operations conducted with restricted category aircraft have provided an acceptable overall level
of safety because the FAA requires restricted category aircraft to meet all the airworthiness requirements of the
appropriate standard category except for those requirements that are not pertinent to the special purpose operation.
In addition, to compensate for the airworthiness requirements that cannot be met by the aircraft configuration,
the FAA places performance or flight limitations upon the aircraft's restricted category operation (for example,
requiring operators to avoid populated areas and to carry only essential personnel) to compensate for airworthiness
standards that cannot be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newport Aeronautical Development Corporation (NADC), seeks to establish a new special purpose operation called
``space vehicle launching'' under the restricted category provisions of &sect;21.25(b)(7), ``Any other operation
specified by the Administrator.'' The special purpose will allow restricted category aircraft to transport and
release air-launched vehicles (ALV) designed to launch payloads (e.g., satellites or other research packages)
into either earth orbit or sub-orbital trajectories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice describes one method of using the proposed special purpose operation. However, if the FAA establishes
this proposed special purpose operation, other individuals and companies may use other methods for operating aircraft
for ``space vehicle launching'' as a special purpose operation in restricted category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ALV/aircraft combination represents a blend of two technologies_aviation and space. Civil aircraft established
their record of safety and reliability during a long history of thorough and careful Federal oversight. The U.S. public
bases its confidence in civil aviation on the knowledge that the FAA will not compromise its safety standards. The
FAA is responsible for the certification of the aircraft, and its operation, to protect the aircraft, the crew, and
the public and property on the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a typical projected use of this category, an operator, such as Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), may use one of
several ALV models that are within the weight carrying capacity of the restricted category aircraft used in this special
purpose operation. Orbital Sciences Corporation's current ALV models range up to 85,000 pounds in weight, contain
several solid or liquid propellant rocket motors, and are designed to launch a payload into outer space. In this example,
an L&hyph;1011 aircraft (or ``carrier aircraft'') may be modified to carry any of the operator's ALV models aloft.
In addition, when not using the carrier aircraft for ALV launch operations, the operator will use the carrier aircraft
for other purposes and will be able to convert the aircraft back to a passenger and/or cargo carrying configuration
after extensive modifications.

Launches will either be licensed by DOT's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST) or carried out by the U.S.
Government on its own behalf. OCST licenses commercial space launches in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch
Act of 1984, as amended (49 U.S.C. App. 2601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (the Act). OCST exercises regulatory authority over launches of launch vehicles to ensure the protection of public
health and safety, the safety of property, and the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.
To obtain a license from OCST, an applicant, such as OSC, must demonstrate that it is capable of conducting launch related
operations safely and responsibly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Launches carried out by the U.S. Government on its own behalf are not subject to the Act and, accordingly, are not licensed
by OCST. In those instances, the FAA would continue to exercise regulatory authority over the civil aircraft and the
U.S. Government would be responsible for launch operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the carrier aircraft/ALV combination will be capable of operating out of many locations worldwide and then
launching an ALV, the takeoff and landing operations may be limited to certain military, government, or selected
civil airports. FAR 91.313(e) places the following constraints upon operation of restricted category aircraft:
``Except when operating in accordance with the terms and conditions of a certificate of waiver or special operating
limitations issued by the Administrator, no person may operate a restricted category civil aircraft within the U.S._(1)
Over a densely populated area; (2) In a congested airway; or (3) Near a busy airport where passenger transport operations
are conducted.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Orbital Sciences Corporation's current proposal is to release the ALV over the ocean but, in some circumstances,
OSC may apply to release the ALV over land. During a typical operation, the pilot would release the ALV after the carrier
aircraft climbs past 38,000 feet above sea level. After falling away from the carrier aircraft, the ALV rocket motor
would ignite and carry the payload into the desired orbital or sub-orbital trajectory. After each rocket stage exhausts
its fuel, the spent stage drops from the ALV. Depending on the ALV's altitude, the spent rocket stage would either drop
back to the earth's surface, burn up in atmospheric reentry, or enter orbit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During ferry flights and launch operations, OSC proposes to use safety inhibits to keep the ALV in a safe condition
and protect the carrier aircraft and persons or property on the ground from inadvertent rocket ignition or other hazardous
events. In addition, OSC proposes to use mechanical safety inhibits to inhibit inadvertent rocket ignition while
the ALV remains attached to the carrier aircraft. OCS will protect the ALV release mechanism on the carrier aircraft
to ensure that the pilot cannot inadvertently release the ALV. OSC has proposed placing a launch control operator
on the carrier aircraft to continuously monitor the ALV's status and to ensure that the safety inhibits remain in place
using carrier aircraft and ALV instrumentation. Safety inhibits are not removed from the motor and other critical
circuits until after the pilot releases the ALV and it has dropped clear of the aircraft. OSC must plan the carrier aircraft
flight routes for both ferry and launch operations to minimize the risk to public safety and the flight routes must
be approved by the FAA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Orbital Science Corporation also proposes to incorporate an onboard command destruct system on the ALV to allow ground
launch range safety personnel to terminate the ALV's flight if, after release, the ALV threatens public safety. The
command destruct system will be inoperative while the ALV remains attached to the carrier aircraft. Should ground
personnel activate the command destruct system after the pilot releases the ALV, the system will disable the rocket
motors and the ALV will fall towards the earth, where they could decide to initiate command destruct action.Depending
on whether the launch is government or commercial, either USAF/NASA/FAA or OCST/FAA, respectively, evaluate potential
risks posed to public safety by possible use of the command destruct system. Either the carrier aircraft's or the ALV's
flight path may be restricted if necessary to protect public safety.In an emergency, the carrier aircraft pilot could
jettison the ALV from the aircraft. If the pilot jettisons the ALV during ferry flight operations or before release
during launch operations, the ALV will fall, intact, to the earth's surface. However, if the pilot jettisons the ALV
only a few moments prior to a normal launch, it is possible that the ground launch range's safety personnel may be able
to activate the command destruct system. In that case, the safety personnel will either allow the ALV to fall to the
earth's surface or initiate the command destruct action, whichever best protects the public safety.Orbital Science
Corporation has conducted four ALV launches from a NASA-owned model NB&hyph;52 at both the Western and Eastern Ranges.
NASA and DOD conducted extensive safety and design reviews for the ALV launches from the NB&hyph;52. OSC expects that
launch operations using the carrier aircraft will be similar to those conducted using NASA's NB&hyph;52.In issuing
restricted category certificates, the FAA is required to prescribe appropriate conditions and limitations upon
the aircraft type design and the operations of those aircraft to ensure the safety of persons and property in the air
and on the ground. The FAA specifically solicits comments on whether the proposed special purpose operation, ``space
vehicle launching,'' would be in the public interest. The requester states that this special purpose would allow
an operator to put payloads in orbit for approximately half the cost of using either conventional rockets or the space
shuttle. Supplying this ``space vehicle launching'' service would provide jobs for both the operator and companies
developing and building the payloads (satellites or research packages). Companies (and individuals) could use
the payloads for business and research activities: Improving communication systems, researching atmospheric
phenomena, improving navigation systems, developing new manufacturing techniques, and more. The FAA also solicits
comment on operational restrictions the public believes are appropriate for these carrier aircraft while transporting
ALV's, and the reasons for those restrictions. Comments should cover both launch and ferry flights.

The attached guidelines were developed for the selection and funding of field Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) projects
under the ART Program which utilize the Highway Innovative Technology Evaluation Center (HITEC) for the development
of evaluation plans. HITEC, an independent non-profit organization, was created by the American Society of Civil
Engineer's (ASCE) Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF), in conjunction with the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the FHWA. HITEC provides a process for the impartial evaluation
of new products, materials, equipment, and services for which industry standards do not exist. Selection of T&amp;E
projects for ART Program funding will be made by the FHWA on the basis of evaluation plans developed by HITEC.

Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applied Research and Technology (ART) Program, authorized under section 6005 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991, Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2170, was established to accelerate the testing
and evaluation of technologies, both domestic and foreign, which are designed to improve the physical and/or operating
characteristics of highways and transit and intermodal systems. These guidelines have been developed in direct
response to section 6005(a) of the ISTEA (codified at 23 U.S.C. 307(e)(2)) and apply to the field Test and Evaluation
(T&amp;E) projects. The purpose of these guidelines is to set forth the FHWA's selection criteria of field T&amp;E
projects for State highway agency construction projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The field T&amp;E projects are but one element of the FHWA's Applied Research and Technology Program. The other elements
include (1) the Applied Research Element, and (2) the Priority Technologies Element. The former includes support
for the development of research and development (R&amp;D) products, the implementation of new technologies, international
activities, and the funding of the operation of HITEC. The latter includes the testing and evaluation of the designated
technologies that are specified in section 6005(e) (4)&hyph;(8) of ISTEA, and the other new and innovative technologies
identified by the FHWA and proposed for partnerships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals for field T&amp;E projects for ART Program funding are invited from State highway agencies, private entities,
individuals, and other organizations. All proposals will be routed through the Highway Innovative Technology Evaluation
Center (HITEC). HITEC, an independent non-profit organization, was created by the American Society of Civil Engineers'
(ASCE) Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF), in conjunction with the American Association of State Highway
and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). HITEC provides a process
for the impartial evaluation of new products, materials, equipment, and services for which industry standards do
not exist. Proposals for funding R&amp;D and other activities not associated with the testing and evaluation of new
technologies will not be evaluated by HITEC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be processed by HITEC under its standard procedures for assessment, planning, evaluation, and
reporting on products, materials, equipment, services, and other technologies. HITEC will act as the central point
of screening of new technologies by the public and private sectors. Highway agencies are encouraged to have private
individuals submit their ideas and proprietary products directly to HITEC for screening and possible evaluation.
If the technology requires a full scale field T&amp;E project, HITEC, by working with the States, will assist applicants
in developing and submitting evaluation plans for T&amp;E projects to the FHWA for possible funding under the ART
Program. State highway agencies may also submit applications to HITEC for non-commercial technologies. The FHWA
will determine the acceptability of the project for funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those technologies that result in State highway agency construction projects approved by the FHWA, the program
provides for ART funding of up to 80 percent to State highway agencies for the cost of installing (constructing) the
new technologies as part of a T&amp;E project. In addition, the costs for testing, data collection, evaluation, and
report preparation associated with the T&amp;E construction project are eligible for 100 percent ART funds. State
highway agencies conducting T&amp;E projects are required to submit annual interim reports and a final report to
document the project, the data collected, and the testing and evaluation results. If the technology fails on an operating
highway, a pro rata share of the repair and/or replacement costs to restore the highway to useable condition may be
financed with Federal-aid funds for that system of highways.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications for technology testing and evaluation and possible ART T&amp;E funding shall be submitted directly
to HITEC. Application requirements are intended to be simple, brief, and straightforward to encourage participation
by private innovators and others who are unfamiliar with the highway market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HITEC has developed an Information and Application Booklet that has been designed to be a comprehensive, self-explanatory
document. It includes an Application Form as well as a description of the technical protocols and HITEC operating
policies. Written inquiries and applications should be addressed to: HITEC, 1015 15th Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20005. The phone number is (202) 842&hyph;0555. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Technologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of new technologies for testing and evaluation includes those that represent significant changes
in the performance or other relevant characteristics of an existing product, but not the minor upgrading of a product
or the use of the evaluation process to promote new interest in an existing product. Technologies should be sufficiently
developed to provide a specific product, system, or process (at least in a prototype stage) for evaluation without
further development. In addition, technologies should employ new materials, designs, manufactured products,
construction procedures, functional components, or other features that may provide improved service and/or operating
or physical characteristics in the highway or transit system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both domestic and foreign technologies are eligible for testing and evaluation in the program. Note that Intelligent
Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) technologies are not eligible for this program. IVHS technologies are specifically
covered under IVHS programs administered by the Department of Transportation and other agencies; IVHS technologies
will be referred to those programs. T&amp;E projects eligible for consideration in the program will include (but
will not be limited to) the following categories of technology: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Accelerated Construction Materials and Procedures. Projects under this category will test and evaluate innovative
uses and modifications of concrete, steel, plastics, composites, and other materials, and innovative procedures
for accelerating construction, including specifications and equipment for pavements, structures, geotechnical
works, and drainage facilities. Rapid-curing materials, prefabricated components, plug-in replacement modules,
automated construction equipment, robots, and sensors are examples of technologies that will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in this category.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Environmentally Beneficial Materials and Procedures. Projects under this category will test and evaluate the
environmental benefits of alternative materials and procedures used in the planning, design, construction, rehabilitation,
operation, and maintenance of highways. Air quality improvements and noise abatement systems for construction,
maintenance, and operations; environmentally benign materials for vegetation control and snow and ice removal;
and environmentally safe paint removal, cleaning, and application are among the hazard-free or beneficial environmental
technologies covered in this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Materials and Techniques That Enhance Serviceability and Longevity Under Adverse Climatic, Environmental,
and Load Effects. This category of projects will include projects using materials and techniques, including design
and construction, seeking to enhance the serviceability and durability of pavements, structures, and appurtenances
under adverse environmental conditions and severe loadings. Strength enhancing additives or reinforcements,
coatings, sealers, composite designs, in situ supplements, and alternative design or construction technologies
are examples of candidates to be included in this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Technologies That Increase Efficiency and Productivity of Vehicular Travel. This category will include projects,
both in the vehicle and on the roadway, such as traffic control devices and systems; traffic management systems, strategies,
and communications; information systems; computer-based tools that permit analysis of area-wide surface transportation
needs and operational plans; and other technologies and procedures that increase the efficiency and productivity
of vehicular travel. Technologies to be explored may include innovative sensing and information transfer technologies,
operational systems, software, and other technologies affecting vehicular travel and demand management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Technologies That Enhance Safety and Accessibility of Vehicular Transportation Systems. Projects under this
category will test and evaluate hardware, software, materials, equipment, and systems that address improved safety
and accessibility of vehicular transportation systems. Also included will be design, construction, and operational
concepts for improved safety or accessibility of vehicular transportation systems, such as guidance and control
systems, visibility and traction improvements, and network operations monitoring and control systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Field Locations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
T&amp;E projects under the ART Program are required to be incorporated in projects constructed on highways eligible
for Federal-aid. Project sites for the testing and evaluation of new technologies will be chosen to insure that an
appropriate range of traffic and operations, cultural, geographic, topographic, climatic, and other necessary
site characteristics are included in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Cost-Sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal share of funding for acquiring, installing, or constructing an approved T&amp;E project will not exceed
80 percent of the costs of the technology incorporated into the project. Non-Federal funds for the matching portion
of the technologies incorporated into the project may be provided by cash payments or an equivalent value in the form
of construction services, equipment, materials, or other services or tangible goods required and used directly
for purchasing, constructing, installing, or otherwise obtaining the approved technology. In addition, the costs
for testing, data collection, evaluation, and report preparation associated with the T&amp;E construction project
are eligible for 100 percent ART funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost-sharing using ART funds is not available to assist small business entrepreneurs, private sector businesses,
individuals, and other private organizations in offsetting standard HITEC fees for processing and evaluation plan
development. The processing fee and evaluation plan development fees for applications submitted to HITEC by State
highway agencies are eligible for 100 percent ART funding. Funds are not available under these guidelines for general
R&amp;D or for any technology development costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible Construction Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Construction features and costs of T&amp;E projects eligible for Federal cost-sharing are those found to be additional
to or different from the features and costs associated exclusively with conventional projects or technologies.
The additional costs, hereafter referred to as Delta Costs, are eligible for up to 80 percent Federal funds. Examples
of three basic categories of features which may generate Delta Costs are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A replacement or substitute for a conventional technology. The Delta Costs would be the costs for the replacement
or substitute, minus the cost of the conventional technology. An example would be a new binder used as a substitute
for asphalt or portland cement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A new addition to or modification of an existing technology. In this case the Delta Costs would be the costs of the
additional technology and its incorporation in the project. An example would be the use of an asphalt modifier for
which the material cost of the modifier and the labor or equipment cost incurred in adding the modifier would constitute
the Delta Costs. If the modification of the existing technology also required an increase in the preparation, handling,
or placement costs over conventional costs, those increased costs also would be a part of the Delta Costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. An entirely new technology added to a project. The Delta Costs in this category would be all of the costs for the new
technology to be incorporated into the project. Examples would be the installation of a system for heating a bridge
deck or the installation of a cathodic protection system for a bridge structure. In general, Delta Costs will not include
those costs associated with the normal construction of the project that are not a direct part of the new technology.
Examples of features that normally would not be included in Delta Costs include: restriping surfaces after overlays,
redecking in conjunction with the installation of a bridge deck heating system, improvement of subsurface and/or
roadside drainage systems in conjunction with a pavement overlay project, and traffic control during construction
(unless it is unique to the installation or changed in character and cost by the installation, in which cases the increased
costs specifically attributable to the portions of the project would be included in the Delta Costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs for data collection, data analysis, and information dissemination are eligible for 100 percent ART funding
on approved T&amp;E projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances where the technology used on an approved T&amp;E project fails and the State is required to repair
the roadway to restore it to full standards, a pro rata share of the repair or replacement costs can be eligible for Federal-aid
funds for that system where the installation took place. Such repair of the roadway will not be considered maintenance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Technology Transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A discussion of the plans for use of the information derived from the project must be included in the proposal. Plans
for the implementation of new technologies resulting from the experiment must include a discussion of the intended
development of specifications, reports, technical papers, training courses, conferences, demonstrations, or
other means of disseminating the useful results throughout the transportation community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evaluation plans for the proposed T&amp;E projects prepared by HITEC and submitted to the FHWA for funding under the
ART Program will be reviewed annually on a fiscal year basis. Selection will be based on specific characteristics
of the projects as presented in the proposals. The selection criteria to be used by the FHWA in evaluating and rating
proposals are listed below in descending order of priority: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicability of the proposed project to the categories of general technologies. Does the project specifically
address one or more of the general categories of technologies covered in the legislation and discussed above in these
guidelines? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Timeliness of the proposed project as a part of an approved and funded construction project of new construction,
rehabilitation, upgrading, or replacement. Does the proposed project fit into an activity that has been approved
and funded for early construction and that will likely proceed with or without the new technology component? Is the
opportunity for the technology limited to the proposed project or are there frequent opportunities to fit the technology
into similar projects? Are there unique characteristics of the project (such as location) that make it especially
appropriate for testing and evaluating the proposed technology? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Clarity of focus and applicability of the new technology being evaluated to areas of need in the national transportation
program. Does the proposed project clearly address a technology of recognized importance in the national transportation
program? Does the proposed technology offer the potential for solving a major problem in current highway programs
or systems (such as bridge deck deterioration, pavement failures, snow and ice control, or urban network capacity
and safety)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Level of funding to be provided by the applicant for the T&amp;E project. While ART funds are available for up to 80
percent of the cost of construction of the T&amp;E project and up to 100 percent of the testing, data collection, and
reporting, extra consideration will be given to projects with higher-than-minimum levels of participation by the
applicant agencies. Non-Federal funding may include, in addition to a monetary match, the furnishing of materials
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
 and/or equipment, specially trained workers used in installing or performing the new technology, and other tangible
contributions of goods or labor specifically related to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Appropriateness of the costs and budget for the project to the potential return on investment in terms of future
increases in safety, serviceability, productivity, durability, economy, environmental quality, and other benefits
to the national transportation systems. What is the anticipated cost-benefit ratio for the proposed project? What
are the potential benefits to the nation's transportation system of the new technology, if successful, in terms of
direct cost savings in construction and/or operations or indirect savings through improved safety, efficiency,
capacity, or other relevant characteristics? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Completeness and technical quality of the project plan and design. The caliber of the plan as a well-designed project
will be assessed. Are the objectives of the project well defined? Are they specific, realistic, and achievable? Do
the steps in the plan focus on those objectives? Are the installation and evaluation procedures, including instrumentation
and data collection, carefully planned and described? Is the proposed plan statistically sound? Have the relevant
variables been accommodated in the plan? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Suitability of the proposed project location(s) for providing the needed environmental and operational conditions
for the evaluation of the technology being studied, the required geographic diversity of locations, and the convenience
and accessibility of the proposed site(s). Is the proposed site for the project suitable to the needs of the technology

ACTION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Advisory to owners and operators of natural and other gas pipeline facilities and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities
concerning certain requirements applying to (1) supplemental incident and accident reports and (2) estimated property
damage totals.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This advisory (1) reminds pipeline facility owners and operators to submit supplements to gas pipeline incident
and hazardous liquid pipeline accident reports as required by the regulations, (2) clarifies what should be included
in estimated property damage totals on incident/accident reports, and (3) cancels a previous interpretation on
costs to be included in these estimated property damage totals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written incident reports are required under 49 CFR 191.9 for gas distribution systems and 49 CFR 191.15 for gas transmission
and gathering systems and accident reports are required under 49 CFR 195.54 for hazardous liquid pipeline systems.
After the initial report has been submitted, the operator is required to submit a supplemental written report whenever
additional relevant information is obtained concerning the particular incident or accident. The form to be used
for supplemental reports is the same as for the initial report, and submittal must be no later than 30 days after acquiring
the additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All relevant costs must be included in the estimated property damage total on the initial written incident or accident
report as well as supplemental reports. This includes (but is not limited to) costs due to property damage to the operator's
facilities and to property of others, commodity/product not recovered, facility repair and replacement, gas distribution
service restoration and relighting, leak locating, right-of-way clean up and environmental clean up and damage.
Facility repair, replacement or change that is not related to the incident but is done by the operator as a matter of
convenience (for example, to take advantage of access to facilities unearthed because of the incident) should not
be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An April 2, 1974, letter from the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to Lakehead Pipeline Company included an interpretation
that ``*&blank;*&blank;* the value of any commodity lost or fittings used during repair which become permanently
attached to the system *&blank;*&blank;*'' is not to be included in the estimate of total property damage. This interpretation
is no longer applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A review of a sampling of incident and accident reports has revealed two problems with the reports: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Supplemental reports were seldom submitted, and (2) many estimates of property damage totals were low and appeared
to be incomplete, particularly in regard to environmental damage including costs associated with cleanup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to item (1), this advisory is a reminder to operators that supplemental reports updating data in the report
are required to be submitted to OPS. Concerning item (2), there has been some misunderstanding on what costs to include
in estimating property damage totals, perhaps because of the April 2, 1974, OPS letter to Lakehead Pipe Line Company.
OPS wants all property damage costs associated with the failures reported on the report forms, particularly the costs
of environmental damage and cleanup costs. Property damage costs that are determined after the initial submittal
of the report forms should be submitted in additional supplemental report forms.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this advisory bulletin is to provide guidance to operators regarding the valve location and spacing
requirements of 49 CFR 192.181(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Advisory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event of an incident or other emergency, the number and location of gas distribution system valves are critical
in achieving the effective shut down and isolation of any section of main in a gas distribution system. The RSPA is providing
guidance in this Advisory Bulletin to owners and operators to assure that valving on high pressure distribution systems
complies with the requirements of &sect;192.181(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Guide for Gas Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems'' (Guide) can be referred to for help in establishing
locations for emergency valves. Developed by the Gas Piping Technology Committee, it is now referenced as American
National Standards Institute ANSI/GPTC Z 380. Copies are available through the American Gas Association; 1515 Wilson
Blvd.; Arlington, VA 22209. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guide lists the following as criteria to be considered when establishing valve locations in high pressure distribution
systems: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Physical Characteristics: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Size of area to be isolated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Topographic features (such as rivers, major highways and railroads). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Number of valves necessary to isolate the area.

&bull;Operating Characteristics: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Number of customers and type of customers such as hospitals, schools and commercial and industrial users that would
be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Time required for available personnel to carry out isolation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Time required for controlling the pressure in the isolated area by means of venting, transferring gas to adjacent
systems, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Time required for available personnel to restore service to customers.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A high pressure gas main in Atlanta, Georgia was ruptured by a construction contractor on December 1, 1977. The National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the incident and found the probable cause was the failure of the
contractor to use information available to him on his blueprint which resulted in the rupture of the gas main. The incident
occurred at 1:00 p.m. and, because of a poor selection of the location and the number of emergency valves, it took until
2:45 p.m. to shut off the flow of gas to the ruptured main. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its accident report on the rupture, NTSB recommended (Safety Recommendation P&hyph;78&hyph;24) that RSPA amend
192.181(a) to specifically define the requirement for location and number of emergency valves. This is not feasible
because the location and number of emergency valves is dependent on local conditions, and because local conditions
vary greatly from operator to operator and city to city. Therefore, by means of this Advisory Bulletin, the attention
of operators is being redirected to the requirements of &sect;192.181(a), and to the Guide for any help it can be toward
meeting the requirements of &sect;192.181(a). Although &sect;192.181 is a design regulation on gas distribution
systems readied for service after March 1971, on systems installed before (as well as after) that date the Guide material
can be used, as noted previously, as a help in determining emergency valve locations.

SPECIAL REQUEST:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This form was developed as a direct result of the enactment of the ``Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act,'' Title
I of Public Law 103&hyph;159, which provides, in part, for a national waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer,
manufacturer, or dealer may lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual. The Act provides that the waiting
period provisions of the law become effective 90 days after the date of enactment, i.e., February 28, 1994; therefore,
the Department of the Treasury, on behalf of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, is requesting Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) review and approval by January 14, 1994. We are submitting this form for public comment by close of
business February 1, 1994. Although this will not allow time for comment on this draft of the form, your comments are
welcome and should be submitted for consideration for possible future revisions of the form.

(a) ensure that the buyer complete Section A and signs the statement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. After the seller has provided notice of the contents of the buyer's intent to obtain a handgun(s) to the Chief Law
Enforcement Officer, this form must be maintained as part of the seller's permanent records, regardless of whether
the transfer occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If prior to the expiration of the 5-day waiting period or prior to actual delivery of the handgun(s) to the buyer,
the seller receives notification from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer that the officer has information that the
possession or receipt of a handgun by the buyer would violate the law, the seller is prohibited from transferring the
handgun(s) to the buyer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Any seller, who after the transfer of an handgun(s) receives a report from a Chief Law Enforcement Officer containing

Instructions to Chief Law Enforcement Officials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This form contains the statement of intent to obtain a handgun(s) by the person identified in Section A. The seller
may not lawfully deliver the handgun(s) to the buyer until 5 business days have elapsed from the date the seller furnished
notice of the contents of this statement to you, or you have notified the seller within the 5-day period that you have
no information that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate Federal, State, or local law.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. You are required to make a reasonable effort to ascertain within the 5-day period whether the buyer's receipt or
possession of a handgun(s) would violate the law, including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems
are available to you, and in any national system designated by the Attorney General. For your information, the receipt
or possession of a handgun by a person who falls within any category of persons listed in Section A, Item 5, would violate
Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. At the earliest possible time, you should advise the seller if the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s)
would violate the law. Unless you notify the seller that the buyer's receipt or possession of a handgun(s) would violate
the law, the seller may deliver the handgun(s) to the buyer. Notification either during or after the 5-day waiting
period may prevent the unlawful receipt of a handgun(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Unless you determine that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate the law, you shall,
within 20 business days from the date of the buyer's statement, destroy this form, any record containing information
derived from this form, and any record created as a result of the notice of the contents of this form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If you determine that the buyer is ineligible to receive or possess a handgun(s), you should maintain this form.
The buyer may request that you provide the reason(s) for such determination and you must provide such reason(s) to
the buyer within 20 business days after the receipt of the request. Your retention of this form may assist you in responding
to such inquiries.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 6, 1994, the Departments of the Army, Agriculture, the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency
signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that recognizes the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) as the lead Federal agency
for wetlands delineations on agricultural lands. Specifically, the MOA articulates the policy and procedures to
be used in the determination of wetlands jurisdiction for purposes of both Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Subtitle
B of the Food Security Act (also known as the Swampbuster program). The MOA, which establishes minimum training requirements
and requires the use of standard interagency approved methods, will improve the quality and consistency of wetlands
determinations on agricultural lands. The actual text of the MOA is published as part of this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 24, 1993, the Clinton Administration announced a comprehensive package of wetlands policy reforms that
will improve the protection of wetlands and make wetlands programs more fair and flexible for landowners. The MOA
signed on January 6, 1994, implements one of the more than 40 initiatives in the Administrations's Wetlands Plan.
The MOA signatory agencies recognize the important contribution of agricultural producers to society, our economy,
and our environment. The agencies are committed to ensuring that Federal wetlands programs are administered in a
manner that minimizes the impacts on affected landowners to the extent possible consistent with the important goal
of protecting wetlands. The MOA was developed in response to concerns that previous practices may have led to confusion
and inconsistent application of Federal wetlands programs and policies on agricultural lands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MOA will minimize duplication and inconsistencies between Swampbuster and the Clean Water Act wetlands programs
and articulate clearly the procedures by which the Nation's farmers can rely on SCS wetlands jurisdictional determinations
on agricultural land for purposes of both the Clean Water Act and Swampbuster programs. The MOA includes provisions
to ensure that agency personnel are properly trained, that standard agreed-upon methods are utilized in making wetlands
determinations, and that appropriate monitoring and oversight is undertaken. The MOA also places emphasis on local
cooperation between the signatory agencies and the improvement of analytical methods for making wetland determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the MOA became effective on January 6, 1994, full implementation will vary from state to state depending on the
level of training required and the development of state wetlands mapping conventions. The signatory agencies will
take appropriate action to expedite implementation of the MOA consistent with such prerequisites.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Departments of the Army, Agriculture, and the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognize
fully that the protection of the Nation's remaining wetlands is an important objective that will be supported through
the implementation of the Wetland Conservation (Swampbuster) provision of the Food Security Act (FSA) and Section
404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The agencies further recognize and value the important contribution of agricultural
producers to our society, our economy, and our environment. We are committed to ensuring that Federal wetlands programs
are administered in a manner that minimizes the impacts on affected landowners to the fullest possible extent consistent
with the important goal of protecting wetlands. We are also committed to minimizing duplication and inconsistencies
between Swampbuster and the CWA Section 404 program. On August 24, 1993, the Administration announced a comprehensive
package of reforms that will improve both the protection of wetlands and make wetlands programs more fair and flexible
for landowners, including the Nations's agriculture producers. This Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) implements
one of over 40 components of the Administration's Wetland Plan.

II. Purpose and Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this MOA is to specify the manner in which wetland delineations and certain other determinations of
waters of the United States made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the FSA will be relied upon for purposes
of CWA Section 404. While this MOA will promote consistency between CWA and FSA wetlands programs, it is not intended
in any way to diminish the protection of these important aquatic resources. In this regard, all signatory agencies
to this MOA will ensure that wetlands programs are administered in a manner consistent with the objectives and requirements
of applicable laws, implementing regulations, and guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Administrator of EPA has the ultimate authority to determine the geographic scope of waters of the United States
subject to jurisdiction under the CWA, including the Section 404 regulatory program. Consistent with a current MOA
between EPA and the Department of the Army, the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) conducts jurisdictional delineations
associated with the day-to-day administration of the Section 404 program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Secretary of the USDA, acting through the Chief of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), has the ultimate authority
to determine the geographic scope of wetlands for FSA purposes and to make delineations relative to the FSA, in consultation
with the Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Definition of Agricultural Lands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this MOA, the term ``agricultural lands'' means those lands intensively used and managed for the
production of food or fiber to the extent that the natural vegetation has been removed and cannot be used to determine
whether the area meets applicable hydrophytic vegetation criteria in making a wetland delineation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Areas that meet the above definition may include intensively used and managed cropland, hayland, pasture land,
orchards, vineyards, and areas which support wetland crops (e.g., cranberries, taro, watercress, rice). For example,
lands intensively used and managed for pasture or hayland where the natural vegetation has been removed and replaced
with planted grasses or legumes such as ryegrass, bluegrass, or alfalfa, are considered agricultural lands for the
purposes of this MOA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. ``Agricultural lands'' do not include range lands, forest lands, wood lots, or tree farms. Further, lands where
the natural vegetation has not been removed, even though that vegetation may be regularly grazed or mowed and collected
as forage or fodder (e.g., uncultivated meadows and prairies, salt hay), are not considered agricultural lands for
the purposes of this MOA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other definitions for the purposes of this MOA are listed below in section VI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Allocation of Responsibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. In accordance with the terms and procedures of this MOA, wetland delineations made by SCS on agricultural lands,
in consultation with FWS, will be accepted by EPA and the Corps for the purposes of determining Section 404 wetland
jurisdiction. In addition, EPA and the Corps will accept SCS wetland delineations on non-agricultural lands that
are either narrow bands immediately adjacent to, or small pockets interspersed among, agricultural lands. SCS is
responsible for making wetland delineations for agricultural lands whether or not the person who owns, manages,
or operates the land is a participant in USDA programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Lands owned or operated by a USDA program participant that are not agricultural lands and for which a USDA program
participant requests a wetland delineation, will be delineated by SCS in coordination with the Corps, or EPA as appropriate,
and in consultation with FWS. Final wetland delineations conducted by SCS pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph
shall not be revised by SCS except where an opportunity for coordination and consultation is provided to the other
signatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. SCS may conduct delineations of other waters for the purposes of Section 404 of the CWA, such as lakes, ponds, and
streams, in coordination with the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, on lands on which SCS is otherwise engaged in wetland
delineations pursuant to paragraphs IV.A or IV.B of this MOA. Delineations of ``other waters'' will not be made until
the interagency oversight team convened pursuant to Section V.B.2 has agreed on appropriate local procedures and
guidance for making such delineations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. For agricultural lands, the signatory agencies will use the procedures for delineating wetlands as described
in the National Food Security Act Manual, Third Edition (NFSAM). For areas that are not agricultural lands, SCS will
use the 1987 Corps Wetland Delineation Manual, with current national Corps guidance, to make wetland delineations
applicable to Section 404. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Delineations on ``agricultural lands'' must be performed by personnel who are trained in the use of the NFSAM. Delineations
on other lands and waters must be performed by personnel who are trained in the use of the 1987 Corps Wetland Delineation
Manual. This MOA includes provisions for the appropriate interagency delineation training below in Section V.E.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. In the spirit of the agencies' commitment to develop agreed upon methods for use in making wetland delineations,
subsequent revisions or amendments to the Corps 1987 manual or portions of the NFSAM affecting the wetland delineation
procedures upon which this agreement is based will require the concurrence of the four signatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. A final written wetland delineation made by SCS pursuant to the terms of this MOA will be adhered to by all the signatory
agencies and will be effective for a period of five years from the date the delineation is made final, unless new information
warrants revision of the delineation before the expiration date. Such new information may include, for example,
data on landscape changes caused by a major flood, or a landowner's notification of intent to abandon agricultural
use and the return of wetland conditions on a prior converted cropland. In accordance with Section 1222 of the FSA,
SCS will update wetland delineations on this five-year cycle. Circumstances under which SCS wetland delineations
made prior to the effective date of this agreement will be considered as final for Section 404 purposes are addressed
in Paragraph V.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H. Within the course of administering their Swampbuster responsibilities, SCS and FWS will provide landowners/operators
general written information (i.e., EPA/Corps fact sheets) regarding the CWA Section 404 program permit requirements,
general permits, and exemptions. The SCS and FWS will not, however, provide opinions regarding the applicability
of CWA Section 404 permit requirements or exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. USDA will maintain documentation of all final written SCS wetland delineations and record the appropriate label
and boundary information on an official wetland delineation map. USDA will make this information available to the
signatory agencies upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. In pursuing enforcement activities, the signatory agencies will rely upon delineations made by the lead agency,
as clarified below, providing a single Federal delineation for potential violations of Section 404 or Swampbuster.
Nothing in this MOA will diminish, modify, or otherwise affect existing EPA and Corps enforcement authorities under
the CWA and clarified in the 1989 ``EPA/Army MOA Concerning Federal Enforcement for the Section 404 Program of the
Clean Water Act.'' EPA, the Corps, and SCS may gather information based on site visits or other means to provide additional
evidentiary support for a wetland delineation which is the subject of a potential or ongoing CWA Section 404 or Swampbuster
enforcement action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
K. For those lands where SCS has not made a final written wetland delineation, and where the Corps or EPA is pursuing,
a potential CWA violation, the lead agency for the CWA enforcement action will conduct a jurisdictional delineation
for the purposes of Section 404 and such delineations will be used by SCS for determining Swampbuster jurisdiction
and potential Swampbuster violations. For those lands where the Corps has not made a final written wetland delineation,
and where SCS is pursuing a potential Swampbuster violation, SCS will make a final written wetland delineation consistent
with Sections IV.A, IV.B, and IV.C of this MOA and provide copies to the Corps and EPA. Such delineations will be used
by the Corps and EPA for the purpose of determining potential violations of the CWA. In circumstances in which either
the Corps or EPA is pursuing a potential CWA violation on land that is subject to an ongoing SCS appeal, a wetland delineation
will be conducted by the Corps or EPA in consultation with SCS and FWS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L. In making wetland delineations, the agencies recognize that discharges of dredged or fill material that are not
authorized under Section 404 cannot eliminate Section 404 jurisdiction, and that wetlands that were converted as
a result of unauthorized discharges remain subject to Section 404 regulation.

V. Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accurate and consistent wetland delineations are critical to the success of this MOA. For this reason, the signatory
agencies will work cooperatively at the field level to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Achieve interagency concurrence on mapping conventions used by SCS for wetland delineations on agricultural
lands, (2) provide EPA and Corps programmatic review of SCS delineations, and (3) certify wetland delineations in
accordance with Section 1222(a)(2) of the FSA, as amended. The following sections describe the procedures that will
be followed to accomplish these objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Mapping Conventions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each SCS State Conservationist will take the lead in convening representatives of the Corps, EPA, FWS, and SCS to
obtain the written concurrence of each of the signatory agencies, within 120 calendar days of the effective date of
this MOA, on a set of mapping conventions for use in making wetland delineations. Only mapping conventions concurred
upon by all signatory agencies will be used by SCS for wetland delineations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If interagency consensus on mapping conventions is not reached within 120 days of the date of this MOA, the State
Conservationist will refer documentation of the unresolved issues to the Chief of SCS. The Chief of SCS will immediately
forward copies of the State Conservationist's documentation of unresolved issues to the Corps Director of Civil
Works; the EPA Director of the Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds; and the FWS Director. Immediately thereafter,
the Chief of SCS or an appropriate designee will lead necessary discussions to achieve interagency concurrence on
resolution of outstanding issues, and will forward documentation of the resolution to the State Conservationist
and the appropriate Headquarters offices of the signatory agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Once interagency concurrence on mapping conventions is obtained, such mapping conventions will be used immediately
in place of the earlier mapping conventions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Agreed-upon mapping conventions developed at the state level will be documented and submitted, for each state,
through the Chief of SCS to the Headquarters of each of the signatory agencies. State-level agreements will be reviewed
by the Headquarters of the signatory agencies for the purpose of ensuring national consistency.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This MOA emphasizes the need to ensure consistency in the manner in which wetlands are identified for CWA and FSA
purposes, and provides a number of mechanisms to increase meaningful interagency coordination and consultation
in order for the agencies to work toward meeting this goal. In this regard, the agencies believe it is critical that
efforts for achieving consistency be carefully monitored and evaluated. Consequently, this MOA establishes a monitoring
and review process that will be used to provide for continuous improvement in the wetland delineation process specified
in this MOA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. EPA will lead the signatory agencies in establishing interagency oversight teams at the state level to conduct
periodic review of wetland delineations conducted under the provisions of this MOA. These reviews will include delineations
done by SCS pursuant to Sections IV.A, IV.B, and IV.C of this MOA and delineations done by EPA or the Corps pursuant to
Section IV.K. of this MOA. These reviews also will include changes to wetland delineations resulting from the SCS
appeals process, as well as disagreements regarding allocation of responsibility. These reviews will occur, at
a minimum, on a quarterly basis for the first year, on a semi-annual basis for the second year, and annually thereafter.
In addition, a review will be initiated whenever one or more of the signatory agencies believes a significant issue
needs to be addressed. The purpose of each review will be to evaluate the accuracy of an appropriate sample of wetland
delineations. When feasible, this will include actual field verifications of wetland delineations. Should the
interagency oversight team identify issues regarding implementation of this MOA or wetland delineations conducted
under the provisions of this MOA, the team will work to resolve those issues and reach agreement on any necessary corrective
actions. Each review, and any necessary corrective action, will be documented in a report to be distributed to the
signatory agencies' appropriate field and Headquarters offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In situations in which the interagency oversight team identifies and reports unresolved issues concerning wetland
delineations conducted under the provisions of this MOA, including changes to wetland delineations resulting from
the SCS appeals process, the Headquarters offices of the signatory agencies will informally review the issue and
work to reach agreement on any necessary corrective actions. This informal process notwithstanding, the EPA Regional
Administrator or the Corps District Engineer may, at any time, propose to designate a geographic area as a ``special
case''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Similar to the terms of the current Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Army and the EPA Concerning
the Determination of the Geographic Jurisdiction of the Section 404 Program and the Application of the Exemptions
under Section 404(f) of the CWA, the EPA Regional Administrator or the Corps District Engineer may propose to designate
a geographic area, or a particular wetland type within a designated geographic area, as a special case. A special case
may be designated only after the interagency oversight team (EPA, Corps, SCS, and FWS) has reviewed the relevant issues
and been unable to reach a consensus on an appropriate resolution. Special cases will be designated by an easily identifiable
political or geographic subdivision, such as a township, county, parish, state, EPA Region, or Corps division or
district, and will be marked on maps or using some other clear format and provided to the appropriate EPA, Corps, FWS,
and SCS field offices. Proposed designations of special cases will not be effective until approved by EPA or Corps
Headquarters, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Upon proposing a special case, the EPA Regional Administrator or Corps District Engineer, as appropriate, will
notify the appropriate SCS State Conservationist in writing. Following notification of the proposed designation,
SCS will not make wetland delineations for the purposes of CWA jurisdiction within the proposed special case for a
period of 20 working days from the date of the notification. SCS may proceed to make wetland delineations for CWA purposes
in the proposed special case after the 20-day period if the SCS State Conservationist has not been notified by the EPA
Regional Administrator or Corps District Engineer of approval of the proposed special case designation by EPA Headquarters
or the Corps Director of Civil Works, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Following approval of the proposed special case, the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, will make final CWA wetland delineations
in the special case area, rather than SCS. In addition, the referring field office (i.e., either the EPA Regional Administrator
or Corps District Engineer) will develop draft guidance relevant to the specific issues raised by the special case
and forward the draft guidance to its Headquarters office. The Headquarters office of the agency which designated
the special case will develop final guidance after consulting with the signatory agencies' Headquarters offices.
EPA concurrence will be required for final guidance for any special case designated by the Corps. Special cases remain
in effect until final guidance is issued by the Headquarters office of the agency which designated the special case
or the designation is withdrawn by the EPA Regional Administrator or Corps District Engineer, as appropriate.

C. Reliance on Previous SCS Wetland Delineations for CWA Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 1222 of the FSA, as amended by the Food Agriculture Conservation and Trade Act, provides that SCS will certify
SCS wetland delineations made prior to November 28, 1990. The intent of this process is to ensure the accuracy of wetland
delineations conducted prior to November 28, 1990, for the purposes of the FSA. This certification process also will
provide a useful basis for establishing reliance on wetland delineations for CWA purposes. All certifications done
after the effective date of this MOA that are done using mapping conventions will use the agreed-upon mapping conventions
pursuant to Section V.A of this MOA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Written SCS wetland delineations for lands identified in section IV.A of his MOA conducted prior to the effective
date of this MOA will be used for purposes of establishing CWA jurisdiction, subject to the provisions of section V.C.3
below. If such SCS wetland delineations are subsequently modified or revised through updated certification, these
modifications or revisions will supersede the previous delineations for purposes of establishing CWA jurisdiction.
Written SCS wetland delineations for lands identified in sections IV.B and IV.C of this MOA conducted prior to the
effective date of this MOA will require coordination with the Corps, or EPA as appropriate, before being used for purposes
of determining CWA jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. As part of the certification effort, SCS will establish priorities to certify SCS wetland delineations. In addition
to responding to requests from individual landowners who feel their original wetland determinations were made in
error, SCS will give priority to certifying those wetland delineations where at least two of the four signatory agencies
represented on the interagency oversight team convened pursuant to section V.B.2 of this MOA agree that SCS wetland
delineations in a particular area, or a generic class of SCS wetland delineations in a particular area, raise issues
regarding their accuracy based on current guidance. These priority areas will be identified only after mapping conventions
are agreed upon pursuant to section V.A of this MOA. Identification of these high priority certification needs shall
be made at the level of the SCS State Conservationist, FWS Regional Director, EPA Regional Administrator, and the
Corps District Engineer. Following identification of these high priority certification needs, the SCS State Conservationist
will immediately notify the affected landowner(s), by letter, that the relevant SCS wetland delineations have been
identified as a high priority for being certified under Section 1222 of the FSA. In addition, the notification will
inform the landowner that while previous wetland delineations remain valid for purposes of the FSA until certification
or certification update is completed, the landowner will need to contact the Corps before proceeding with discharges
of dredged or fill material. This communication by the landowner will enable the Corps to review the wetland delineation
to establish whether it can be used for purposes of CWA jurisdiction. The SCS State Conservationist will initiate,
within 30 calendar days of landowner notification, corrective measures to resolve the wetland delineation accuracy
problem.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Landowners for whom SCS makes wetland delineations for either Swampbuster or Section 404 will be afforded the opportunity
to appeal such wetland delineations through the SCS appeals process. In circumstances where an appeal is made and
the State Conservationist is considering a change in the original delineation, the State Conservationist will notify
the Corps District Engineer and the EPA Regional Administrator to provide the opportunity for their participation
and input on the appeal. FWS also will be consulted consistent with the requirements of current regulations. The Corps
and EPA reserve the right, on a case-by-case basis, to determine that a revised delineation resulting from an appeal
is not valid for purposes of Section 404 jurisdiction.

1. SCS, in addition to FWS and EPA, will continue to participate in the interagency wetland delineation training sponsored
by the Corps, which is based on the most current manual used to delineate wetlands for purposes of Section 404. Completion
of this training will be a prerequisite for field staff of all signatory agencies who delineate wetlands on non-agricultural
lands using the 1987 Corps Wetland Delineation Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The interagency wetland delineation training will address agency wetland delineation responsibilities as defined
by this MOA, including SCS NFSAM wetland delineation procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Field offices of the signatory agencies are encouraged to provide supplemental interagency wetland delineation
training (i.e., in addition to that required in paragraph IV.E), as necessary, to prepare SCS field staff for making
Section 404 wetland delineations. For training on the use of the 1987 Corps Wetland Delineation Manual, such supplemental
training will rely on the training materials used for the Corps delineation training program and will provide an equivalent
level of instruction.
