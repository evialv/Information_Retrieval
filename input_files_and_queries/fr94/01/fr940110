SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule promulgates new United States Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Grades of Whipped Butter. These standards establish quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for grade determination and optional microbiological and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keeping-quality tests for whipped butter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that the grading of butter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold in consumer-size packages bearing USDA official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification (grade-label) should be conducted when the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in the final package. Previously, the quality of whipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butter was evaluated prior to the whipping process using the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards for Grades of Butter. The U.S. Standards for Grades of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whipped Butter change this procedure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule has been reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule also has been reviewed in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities because use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards is voluntary and this action will not increase costs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those utilizing the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the Department evaluated the procedures used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assign U.S. grades to butter in consumer-size packages. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department concluded that grading of the product should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in the final package because the evaluation of whipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butter at that time is more accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously, the procedure for evaluating grade-label whipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butter was to either grade the butter in the bulk form prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whipping or obtain a sample of fresh butter taken during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing process and evaluate it. These methods are changed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this action because of the Department's decision to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grading in the final package. The new standards have received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general support from many of the manufacturers of whipped butter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who utilize the USDA grade-label program, as well as from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Butter Institute. In addition, the standards were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field-tested by the Dairy Grading Branch and found to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the need for new standards, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34937) proposed United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards for Whipped Butter. Except for minor format changes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards contained in this final rule are the same as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in the proposal. The new standards establish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Provide Quality Specifications for Whipped Butter at Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Grade Levels: U.S. Grade AA and U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
Grade A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whipped butter is produced by uniformly incorporating air or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inert gas into butter to improve its spreadability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics. The percent overrun, based on buyer or consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preference, is usually between 50 and 100 percent. Market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis conducted during the development of these standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supports the opinion that consumers prefer the higher quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Therefore, standards are established for quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designations at two levels: U.S. Grade AA and U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grade A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Define Flavor Characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Production and processing practices influence flavor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics in whipped butter. To manufacture whipped butter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a highly pleasing flavor, the raw milk and cream must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free of objectionable flavors. This final rule defines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable flavor characteristics to assist the graders in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying and classifying the flavor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Define Body, Color, and Salt Characteristics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establish Disratings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Just as production and processing practices influence the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavor of whipped butter, they also influence body, color, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt characteristics. This final rule describes distinguishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body, color, and salt characteristics and establishes disratings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are used to determine the U.S. grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Illustrate How Flavor, Body, Color, and Salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Characteristics Influence Grade Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These standards provide step-by-step instructions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the final grade of whipped butter. The U.S. grade of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whipped butter is determined on the basis of classifying first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flavor characteristics. Then body, color, and salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics are noted and disratings established. When total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disratings exceed the permitted amount identified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, the final U.S. grade is lowered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Establish Optional Microbiological and Keeping-Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tests (Not Mandatory for Grade Designation) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1975, the General Specifications for Dairy Plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service have required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological and keeping-quality testing of whipped butter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bearing USDA official identification. The market analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted during the development of these standards revealed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry utilized tighter microbiological specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proteolytic and yeast and mold counts than those listed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``General Specifications''. To be more aligned with current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry standards, this final rule tightens these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological requirements. This final rule also incorporates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these same tests as optional tests (not mandatory for grade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation) in the United States Standards for Grades of Whipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Butter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also makes corollary changes in the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grading Service (subpart B of 7 CFR part 58) to conform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition and grade designations of whipped butter set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therein with the new United States Standards for Grades of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whipped Butter (in subpart G of 7 CFR part 58). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA grade standards are voluntary standards that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7 U.S.C. 1621 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) to facilitate the marketing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of dairy products are free to choose whether or not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use these grade standards. USDA grade standards for dairy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products have been developed to identify the degree of quality in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the various products. Quality in general refers to usefulness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirability, and value of the product_its marketability as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity. When whipped butter is officially graded, the USDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and standards governing the grading of manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or processed dairy products are used. These regulations also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a charge for the grading service provided by USDA. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action makes minor format changes for purposes of clarity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tables I and III to the format that appeared in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule.

Nomenclature of U.S. grades.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nomenclature of U.S. grades is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) U.S. Grade AA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) U.S. Grade A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. grade of whipped butter is determined on the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of classifying first the flavor characteristics and then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics in body, color, and salt of a representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample. Flavor is the basic quality factor in grading whipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butter and is determined organoleptically by smell and taste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The flavor characteristic and intensity is identified and rated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the applicable classification contained in Table I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;58.2430. When more than one flavor characteristic is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discernible in a sample of whipped butter, the flavor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification of the sample shall be established on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flavor that carries the lowest rating. Body, color, and salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics are then noted and disratings are made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the established classification in Table II in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;58.2430. The final U.S. grade for the sample is then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in accordance with the flavor classification, subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to permitted disratings for body, color, and salt as outlined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;58.2431.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following: Shall possess a fine and highly pleasing butter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavor. Whipped butter may also have a lactic culture flavor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May possess a slight feed, or a definite cooked flavor. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted disratings in body, color, and salt characteristics are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to one-half (1/2). For detailed specifications and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification of flavor characteristics, see Table I of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. For body, color, and salt disratings, see Table II of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
U.S. Grade A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. Grade A whipped butter conforms to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following: Shall possess a pleasing and desirable butter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavor. Whipped butter may also have a lactic culture flavor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May possess to a slight degree the following flavors: acid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aged, bitter, coarse, flat, smothered, and storage. May possess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a definite feed flavor. The permitted disratings in body, color, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and salt characteristics are limited to one-half (1/2). For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed specifications and classification of flavor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics, see Table I of this section. For body, color,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whipped butter of all U.S. grades shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free from foreign materials and visible mold. When total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disratings exceed the permitted amount, the final U.S. grade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be lowered one grade level for each additional one-half (1/2)

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of the interim
final rules that authorized expenses and established assessment rates for the Texas Valley Citrus Committee and
the Papaya Administrative Committee (Committees) under Marketing Order Nos. 906 and 928, respectively. Authorization
of these budgets enables the Committees to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer their respective
programs. Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 906 [7 CFR part 906] regulating the handling
of oranges and grapefruit grown in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas; and Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order
No. 928, as amended [7 CFR part 928] regulating the handling of papayas grown in Hawaii. The marketing orders are effective
under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred
to as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, oranges and grapefruit grown in Texas and papayas grown in Hawaii are subject to assessments. It is intended
that the assessment rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, and papayas
handled during the 1993-94 fiscal year, beginning August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994 (M.O. 906), and July 1, 1993,
through June 30, 1994 (M.O. 928). This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA
is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not
be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder,
are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.
Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 135 handlers of oranges and grapefruit, and 120 handlers of papayas subject to regulation
under their respective marketing orders each season. In addition, there are approximately 2,500 orange and grapefruit
producers in Texas, and 300 papaya producers in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small
Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural
service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the orange, grapefruit,
and papaya producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The respective marketing orders require that the assessment rates for a particular fiscal year shall apply to all
assessable oranges, grapefruit, and papayas handled from the beginning of such year. An annual budget of expenses
is prepared by each Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committees are handlers
and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods,
services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets
are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate
and provide input.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rates recommended by the Committees are derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of oranges, grapefruit, and papayas. Because these rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established
at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. The recommended budgets
and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred
on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committees
will have funds to pay their expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interim final rule was issued for the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (TVCC), on July 7, 1993, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
[58 FR 37635, July 13, 1993] effective for the period August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994, with a 30-day comment period
ending August 12, 1993. The interim final rule authorized expenses of $984,319 and an assessment rate of $0.15 per
7/10 bushel carton for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. No comments were filed on the expenses and assessment rate in
the interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TVCC met again on August 3, 1993, and unanimously recommended increasing authorized expenses to $1,180,925,
a $196,606 increase from the previously authorized amount. The TVCC also unanimously recommended increasing the
assessment rate from $0.15 per 7/10 bushel carton to $0.18 per 7/10 bushel carton, a $0.03 increase per 7/10 bushel
carton from the previously established assessment rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 [58 FR 53111, October 14, 1993] effective for the period August 1, 1993 through July 31, 1994, and provided a 30-day
comment period. This amended interim final rule increased authorized expenses to $1,180,925, and increased the
assessment rate to $0.18 per 7/10 bushel carton of assessable oranges and grapefruit for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal
year under the order. The $196,606 expense increase is necessary to provide additional funds for order operations,
including $172,606 to fund increased administrative and compliance expenses, primarily for the maintenance of
road guard stations, and $24,000 to cover a shortfall in the Mexican Fruit Fly support program. The increase in the
assessment rate along with the withdrawal of additional funds from the TVCC's reserves, will adequately fund the
increased expenses.

 [58 FR 33759, June 21, 1993] effective for the period July 1, 1993, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994, with a 30-day comment period ending July 21, 1993. The interim final rule authorized expenses of $700,580
and an assessment rate of $0.0085 per pound of fresh papayas for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. No comments were filed
on the expenses and assessment rate in the interim final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the PAC met again on August 13, 1993, and unanimously recommended decreasing authorized expenses from $700,580
to $597,860, a $102,720 decrease in expenses from the authorized amount. The PAC also unanimously recommended decreasing
the assessment rate from $0.0085 to $0.0069, a $0.0016 decrease in the assessment rate, based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58 million pounds of fresh papayas, from the previously established assessment rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 [58 FR 53117, October 14, 1993] effective for the period July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, and provided a 30-day comment
period. This amended interim final rule decreased authorized expenses to $597,860, and reduced the assessment rate
to $0.0069 per pound of fresh papayas for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year under the order. Program income for the PAC decreased
from $701,660 to $599,356, a $102,304 decrease from the previous estimate. Major program income reductions come
from a $92,800 decrease in assessment income due to the lower assessment rate and a $9,504 reduction in income from
the Department's Foreign Agricultural Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The $102,720 decrease in expenses results from reductions in a number of expense items. Major expense reductions
include expenditures for salaries and wages, office rent, auto expenses, and Japanese advertising and promotion.
The projected income over expenses has increased from $1,080 to $1,496, a $416 increase from the previous amount.
The excess funds will be added to the PAC's operational reserve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended interim final rules were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 53111 October 14, 1993], for 7 CFR part 906, and [58 FR 53117, October 14, 1993], for 7 CFR part 928. Each interim
final rule provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 [5 U.S.C. 553]. The Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1993&hyph;94 fiscal years for the programs began on August 1, 1993, for Texas citrus and July 1, 1993, for
Hawaii papayas. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable
oranges, grapefruit, and papayas handled during the fiscal years. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions
which were recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document is issued under Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 [7 CFR parts 907 and 908], as amended, regulating the
handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California, hereinafter referred
to as the ``orders.'' These orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation
under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia
oranges in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona
navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule invites comments on two changes to the reporting requirements currently prescribed under the California-Arizona
orange marketing orders. This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue
the use of Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders specify that, for the handling
of oranges other than by rail car (primarily truck shipments), handlers issue to the consignee an assignment of allotment
certificate covering each quantity of oranges so handled. Sections 907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations
require handlers to submit such information on Form 8. Handlers are also required to segregate the information on
Form 8 by size of oranges shipped and destination (i.e., U.S. and Alaska or Canada). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the inception of the orders, the committees have utilized Form 8 primarily for tracking and verifying truck
shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the
orders suspended [58 FR 53,114; October 14, 1993], the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8 creates
an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the committees, many handlers have long questioned the value of Form 8 (commonly referred to in the industry
as ``the daily truck ticket'') during periods of no volume regulation. Shipment information from Form 8 is transferred
to Form 4 (Weekly Report). Handlers maintain their own manifest records of these shipments and, without weekly volume
regulation, Form 4 provides similar data with the exception of number of cartons shipped by size. The committees plan
on requesting size information from handlers as needed on a voluntary basis and anticipate revising the weekly Form
4 at a later time to provide for the collection of size information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8, particularly during periods of no volume regulation,
is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the orders
and &sect;&sect;907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 8 will be discontinued.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
Currently, sections 907.71 and 908.71 of the orange orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information
regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate
whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the
orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit this information for rail car shipments on Form 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collected on Form 3 is similar to the information collected on Form 8 described earlier, but pertains
to rail car shipments rather than truck shipments. Again, this information has historically been utilized primarily
for tracking and verifying shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume
regulation features of the orders suspended, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, like Form
8, creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. Handlers are also required to submit similar information
on rail car shipments on the weekly Form 4. As with size information pertaining to truck shipments, the committees
plan on requesting size information from handlers for rail car shipments on a voluntary basis until the weekly Form
4 is appropriately revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like Form 8, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, particularly during periods of no volume
regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending &sect;&sect;907.71 and
908.71 of the orders and &sect;&sect;907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 3 will be
discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers
0581&hyph;0116 for navel oranges and 0581&hyph;0121 for Valencia oranges. This rule will reduce the reporting burden
on approximately 265 handlers of navel and Valencia oranges who have been completing Form 8, taking about .40 hour
to complete each report. This rule will also reduce the reporting burden on about 80 orange handlers who ship by rail
at some point during a season and utilize Form 3, taking about 0.20 hours to complete each report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that the provisions detailed below, at this time, do not tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest
to give preliminary notice prior to putting this action into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the
effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) Handlers are currently shipping navel oranges and these actions will reduce the burden of information
collection placed on such handlers; (2) the committees unanimously recommended these actions at public meetings
and all interested persons had an opportunity to provide input; (3) these actions relax reporting requirements;
(4) California-Arizona orange handlers are aware of this action and need no additional time to comply with the relaxed
requirements; and (5) this action provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior
to finalization of this action.

 This document finalizes without change an interim final rule that amended the rules and regulations established
under the marketing order covering California-Arizona lemons to increase from 350 to 500 cartons per week, the amount
of organic lemons handlers may ship without regard to volume and size regulations. The marketing order regulates
the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona and is administered locally by the Lemon Administrative Committee
(Committee). This final rule recognizes additional opportunity to market organic lemons to organic or health food
wholesalers and retailers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 910 [7 CFR part 910], as amended, regulating the handling of lemons grown
in California and Arizona, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 2,000 producers of lemons in the production area and approximately 70 handlers subject to
regulation under the marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified
as small entities.

Section 910.80 of the order authorizes the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to establish minimum quantities
and types of shipments which shall be free from regulation under this order. Section 910.180(d)(3) of the administrative
rules and regulations prescribes procedures governing exemption from volume and size regulations for organic lemons
handled in minimum quantities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 23, 1993, Mr. Rich Hart, President of Rainbow Valley Orchards, sent a letter to the Committee requesting an
increase in the amount of organic lemons a handler may ship free of order regulations to 500 cartons per week. Currently,
handlers can ship up to 350 cartons of such lemons weekly. At its August 3, 1993, meeting, the Committee recommended
increasing the organic exemption provision from 350 to 500 cartons per week that handlers may ship to organic or health
food wholesalers and retailers without regard to volume and size regulations. The vote on the recommendation was
12 in favor and 1 abstention. The person who abstained expressed a concern with the definition of organic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shippers of organic lemons have indicated that organic fruit markets can absorb more fruit than in the past, and that
they need to take advantage of the additional marketing opportunity. The Committee expects the increase in shipments
allowed will provide shipping flexibility for organic shippers and will facilitate the marketing of organic lemons.
The Committee also believes that sales of organic lemons will not adversely impact sales of regulated lemons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on October 4, 1993, with an effective date of October 8, 1993, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 52401, October 8, 1993]. The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending November 8, 1993, and
no comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule amended the rules and regulations of the lemon marketing order. This rule modifies language
in the order's rules and regulations to increase from 350 to 500 cartons per week, the amount of organic lemons handlers
may ship free of order regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the information collection requirements
that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule that authorizes the use of smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles for California olives.
This rule is effective during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year and establishes minimum grade and size requirements for
such olives in the order's rules and regulations. This final rule also adopts, without change, the provisions of an
interim final rule that authorizes the importation of certain bulk olives into the United States to be used in the production
of limited use styles of olives such as wedges, halves, slices, or segments. This action is intended to allow more olives
into fresh market channels and is consistent with current market requirements. This action also updates the Federal-State
inspection office address list contained in the import regulation.

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 932 (7 CFR part 932), as amended, regulating the handling
of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.

This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities imported into the United States that are the same
as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities under the Federal marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season,
and there are about 1,350 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to
the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms,
have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000. None
of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority of olive producers and importers
may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout
California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. In 1990, about 77 percent of the production
came from the San Joaquin Valley and 23 percent from the Sacramento Valley. California olives are primarily used for
canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking
and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is essentially a domestic market. Very few shipments of California olives
are exported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972&hyph;73 crop year to a high of 168,500 tons
during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1991&hyph;92 production
totalled about 63,260 tons. The various varieties of olives produced in California have alternate bearing tendencies
with high production one year and low the next. Total production for the 1992&hyph;93 crop year is approximately 163,500
tons. Total production for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year is estimated to be 110,000 tons. However, based on past production
and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller sized olives during the 1993&hyph;94
crop year to meet market requirements for limited use styles of canned olives for the 1993&hyph;94 year. Absent this
action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning uses would have to be disposed
of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for
whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized
for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in &sect;932.51(a)(3)
and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in &sect;932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended.
The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted
under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by
the Secretary. The sizes authorized herein are the same as those established for the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The minimum
sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the marketing
order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had to be disposed
of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower on smaller fruit
used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but two crop
years since the order was instituted in 1965. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the 1971 amendment, there have been substantial changes within the olive industry. In spite of the annual limited
use authorization, in recent years the industry has not been able to meet market needs for its products, especially
the limited use styles used primarily by the food service industry. The demand for processed olives and for limited
use styles is expected to continue to increase. At the same time, the industry has not been able to increase production
to meet market needs for canned ripe olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee conducted a study during the 1990&hyph;91 crop year to determine the feasibility of utilizing smaller
sized olives in the production of limited use styles and to determine which sizes could be efficiently processed into
such styles. All olive handlers within the industry participated in the study. All handlers reported that smaller
sizes can be efficiently processed into limited use styles. Advanced technology in the form of better processing
equipment is currently available. The new technology allows handlers to process smaller olives into limited use
styles more efficiently than was possible in the past. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market requirements for limited use style olives based
upon current conditions. The size requirements allow the use of sizes which would otherwise have to be disposed of
for non-canning use. In turn, growers should receive a larger return from such olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By a mail ballot vote ending June 15, 1993, the committee unanimously recommended establishment of grade and size
regulations during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order. The grade
requirements are the same as established in recent seasons. The specific sizes for the variety groups are the minimum
sizes which are deemed desirable for use in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting
the use of the smaller olives in the production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong
market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives
than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided
to maximize the use of the available olive supplies and facilitate market expansion, thereby increasing returns
to growers. In the absence of this action, the smaller fruit would have to be disposed of for less profitable, non-canning
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives
under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows
smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the
olive import regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet
certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Olive Regulation 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (7 CFR 944.401). All canned ripe olives are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release from
custody of the United States Custom Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must be inspected
and certified prior to canning. ``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers and heat sterilized
under pressure, of two distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the current U.S. Standards for
Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (7 CFR 52.3751&hyph;52.3764). The term does not include Spanish-style green olives.
Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported or disposed of under the supervision of the
Processed Products Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives
borne by the importer. Any person may import up to 100 pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt
from these grade and size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule modifies paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation (7 CFR 944.401 (b)(12)) to authorize the
importation of bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for whole and whole
pitted uses to be used in the production of limited use styles for the 1993&hyph;94 season which begins August 1, 1993.
This rule also establishes size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Import regulations issued under the Act are based on regulations established under Federal marketing orders to regulate
domestically produced products. The grade and size requirements contained in the olive import regulation are based
on those in effect for olives grown in California under Marketing Order No. 932. This action reflects a recommendation
by the committee to change the requirements for olives for limited use styles grown in California. The committee works
with the Department in administering the marketing order program for California olives.

Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the California olive marketing order provides that processed olives smaller
than the sizes prescribed for whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee
and approved by the Secretary. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various
size categories by variety groups. This is to recognize the different sizing characteristics of the individual varieties
and types of California olives. Olives used in limited use styles are too small to be desirable for use as whole or whole
pitted canned olives because their flesh-to-pit ratio is too low. However, they are satisfactory for use in the production
of limited use styles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee unanimously recommended to authorize establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited
use styles during the 1993&hyph;94 season. These minimum sizes would be the same as those established for the 1992&hyph;93
season. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various variety groups and are
the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import regulation to apply comparable
requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes are as follows:

Each of the categories includes a 35 percent tolerance for olives weighing less than the specified minimum size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is necessary because section 8e of the Act provides that when domestically produced olives are regulated
under a Federal marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity
requirements. Thus, authorizing the use of smaller sized California olives in the production of limited use styles
and establishing size regulations for such olives requires that the same or comparable regulations be issued for
imported bulk olives.

Permitting the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take better advantage
of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will be able to import
and market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional
opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply and facilitate market expansion. In the
absence of this action, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited uses, and would have to be disposed of through
less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection service or exported.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

. The suspension will allow transfers of Class I fluid milk products from a distributing plant to other plants regulated
under Order 106 to be counted as part of the distributing plant's route sales for the purpose of determining the plant's
pool status under the order. The suspension was requested by Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), and Mid-America
Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-America), who stated that it was necessary to restore equity among producers supplying handlers
regulated under Order 106.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this final rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This suspension
will lessen the opportunity for disorderly marketing conditions and will tend to ensure that dairy farmers continue
to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the
rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part
900).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63120), concerning the proposed suspension of certain words from the route disposition
definition of Order 106. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the notice by submitting written data,

After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice and other available information,
it is hereby found and determined that the following provision of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southwest
Plains marketing area will not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act for an indefinite period commencing
with the publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document will suspend certain words from the route disposition definition of the order. The effect of this change
will be to include transfers of fluid milk products to other plants regulated under Order 106 in determining if the
transferor plant meets the pool qualification requirements specified in &sect;1106.7(a) of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Mid-America and AMPI, two cooperative associations representing a substantial number of producers
whose milk is pooled under Order 106, a Tulsa, Oklahoma, handler receiving milk from non-member producers is also
supplied supplemental milk from cooperative associations that pool milk on the Southwest Plains milk order. The
proponents argued that as a result of excluding transfers of fluid milk products to other plants regulated under Order
106, the handler has been a partially regulated plant in recent months and could be again in the future. Mid-America
and AMPI explained that, since the handler's Class I utilization is higher than the market's average, the handler
has been able to pay its non-member producers a price in excess of the order's blend price. In addition to the inequity
resulting from this price disparity, AMPI, during the month of September, was required to depool milk that it had diverted
from the Tulsa plant because the plant otherwise would have failed to qualify as a pool plant during the month of September.
This resulted in additional financial loss to the cooperative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A letter supporting the suspension was filed on behalf of the proponents. There were no comment letters received in
opposition to the suspension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest in that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given to interested parties, and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views, or arguments concerning this suspension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of South Dakota has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed South Dakota's
application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that South Dakota's hazardous waste program
revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve
South Dakota's hazardous waste program revisions. South Dakota's application for program revision is available
for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. South Dakota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
South Dakota initially received final authorization in November 1984. Revisions to the program were approved on
June 17, 1991, June 29, 1992, and September 8, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed South Dakota's application, and has made an immediate final decision that South Dakota's hazardous
waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to South Dakota. The public may
submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 9, 1994. Copies of South Dakota's application
for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of South Dakota's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment
is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response
to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft application was submitted on April 30, 1993. The State of South Dakota addressed all of EPA's concerns prior
to submittal of the final application. Thus, the South Dakota program is granted immediate final authorization for
the provisions in the following Table.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
I conclude that South Dakota's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, South Dakota is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Dakota has not requested authorization to operate its hazardous waste program, as revised, in ``Indian Country''
as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. Accordingly, today's decision to grant South Dakota final hazardous waste authorization,
as revised, does not extend to Indian Country. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous waste authority
under RCRA which applies to ``Indian Country'' in South Dakota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Dakota now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and
previously approved authorities. South Dakota also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains
the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to issue orders under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003
of RCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Dakota has agreed to submit a draft application for RCRA cluster 1 and land disposal restriction rules by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31, 1993, a draft application for RCRA cluster 2 by December 31, 1994. Final applications will be submitted
within 60 working days of receipt of EPA's comments on the draft application. The State has agreed to submit a final
application for the TC rules within six months of EPA's decision on the proposed rule (December 24, 1992) to suspend
the Toxicity Characteristics rule (Hazardous Waste Codes D018 through D043).

Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of South Dakota's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

This document amends the General Services Administration (GSA) Regulations by adding procedures to implement the
Federal Tax Refund Offset Program in GSA. Participation in the program is mandated by the Cash Management Improvement
Act amendments of 1992. The GSA expects to improve the collection of delinquent debts due the agency by participation
in the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant rule for the purposes
of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 10, 1993, because it is not likely to result in an economic impact exceeding
$100 million or more, to have a material adverse effect on the economy, environment or safety, to interfere with the
actions of another agency, to materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs,
or to raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in E.O. 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment has not been prepared. GSA has based all administrative
decisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the need for and the consequence of this rule;
has determined that the potential benefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs; has maximized
the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involving the least net cost to society.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) This part implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past due legally
enforceable debt owed to the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of this section, a past due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the
United States and:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Has been delinquent for at least three months but, except in the case of a judgment debt, has not been delinquent
more than ten years at the time the offset is made;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) With respect to which, GSA has given the taxpayer at least 60 days, from the date of notification, to present evidence
that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered such evidence, and has determined
that the debt is past due and legally enforceable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the administrative offset provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Has been disclosed by GSA to a credit reporting agency, including a consumer reporting agency as authorized by
31 U.S.C. 3711(f);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule adopts as final the interim final rule that provided for Medicare coverage of EPO used by ESRD beneficiaries
who dialyze at home and are competent to use the drug without medical or other supervision and established criteria
for selection of patients that can be considered ``competent'' and for monitoring of the patients who are selected.
It also makes minor changes in response to public comments on the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule was necessary to implement section 4201(d)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA
'90). The purpose of the amendments is to facilitate use of EPO at home, while ensuring that such use of the drug is safe.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a progressive and usually irreversible decline in kidney function that does not always
require regular dialysis. However, CRF patients who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) do require a regular course
of dialysis or kidney transplantation in order to sustain life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 299I of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (Pub. L. 92&hyph;603) established the Medicare ESRD benefit
by extending coverage to any individual who requires either dialysis or transplantation and meets the following
requirements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Is fully or currently insured or entitled to monthly benefits under title II of the Social Security Act; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is the spouse or dependent child of the insured or entitled individual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methods and amounts of payment for services to ESRD patients have changed over the years and are currently set forth
in &sect;&sect;410.50, 410.52, and 413.170&hyph;413.179 of the HCFA rules. Law and program policy have moved over
the years towards encouraging greater use of self-dialysis and home dialysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 1, 1989, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the generic drug epoetin which we commonly refer to
as ``EPO''. EPO is a sterile, colorless, preservative-free, liquid, biologically engineered protein that stimulates
the bone marrow to make new red blood cells. EPO may be covered under the Medicare program when used to treat anemia associated
with chronic renal failure. Most chronic renal failure patients are anemic because their kidneys are unable to produce
sufficient amounts of a substance called erythropoietin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Patients with chronic renal failure include those who require renal dialysis and are eligible for Medicare under
the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) provisions of the law. In accordance with the labeling approved by the FDA, EPO
may be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic
renal failure or anemia induced by the drug AZT used by patients with the HIV virus. Individuals with chronic renal
failure use the drug to elevate or maintain the red blood cell level (as measured by the hematocrit or hemoglobin level)
and to decrease the need for blood transfusions. Chronic renal patients considered for initiation of EPO therapy
should generally have a hematocrit of less than 30%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July, 1989, we issued instructions in the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 1 (Chapter 27, Transmittal 11) authorizing
Medicare contractors to start paying for the drug EPO, as of June 1, 1989. Coverage instructions were issued in November
1989 in the Intermediary Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1449), Carriers Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1329), Hospital
Manual (Transmittal 576) and the Renal Dialysis Facility Manual (Transmittal 42). The effective date of the coverage
instructions was also June 1, 1989. The Medicare regulations were not amended at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before enactment of Public Law 101&hyph;508 (OBRA '90), home use of EPO was not covered. For patients who dialyzed
at home to receive Medicare payment for EPO, the drug had to be administered either in an ESRD facility or as a service
``incident to'' a physician's professional services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4201(d)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1861(s)(2) of the Act by adding a new subparagraph (Q) that_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Provides for coverage, effective July 1, 1991, of EPO that is used by home dialysis patients who are competent
to use the drug without medical or other supervision and for coverage of items related to administration of the drug;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Requires the Secretary to establish by regulation methods and standards for the safe and effective use of the
drug at home.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4201(c) of that same law provided for payment for EPO furnished to ESRD patients by Medicare approved dialysis
facilities to be made at the rate of $11 per 1,000 units, rounded to the nearest 100 units, effective January 1, 1991.
Section 13566 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) sets the rate at $10
per 1,000 units effective January 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typically, EPO is administered at the end of the dialysis treatment. Therefore, unless medical documentation shows
that it is necessary to administer EPO at a time other than during dialysis, payment for patients who dialyze at a facility
is made only to the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change made by section 13555(b) of OBRA '93, which provides for coverage of EPO self-administered by any dialysis
patient (not limited to those who dialyze at home) will be implemented by separate regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For home use of EPO supplied to a home dialysis patient competent to administer the drug without medical supervision,
HCFA pays only a Medicare approved dialysis facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies, if the
patient obtains the drug directly from the supplier. In either case, payment for home use of EPO is made at the rate described
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a home patient is competent to use EPO without supervision and the drug has been prescribed, generally the patient's
dialysis facility would furnish it. If a physician administers EPO to the patient, it should be the physician who receives
the Monthly Capitation Payment (MCP) for furnishing the beneficiary's renal-related services. If a physician other
than the MCP physician furnishes EPO, this physician must look to the MCP physician for payment for EPO administration.
In this latter case, HCFA pays on a reasonable charge basis for the drug, but makes no additional payment to the physician
for administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA will announce annually, for public comment, whether an update in the EPO allowance is appropriate. By statute,
any increase will not exceed the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for the gross national
product for the second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the
second preceding year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the interim final rule with comment period, published on September 4, 1991, we made the changes discussed below:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Major changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We amended subpart U of part 405 of the HCFA rules, which sets forth the conditions for coverage of services furnished
to ESRD beneficiaries, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Patient selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure the safe and effective use of EPO by home dialysis patients, we amended &sect;405.2163 to require that the
patient's dialysis facility or the physician responsible for all dialysis-related services make a comprehensive
assessment of the patient and the patient's needs at the time of selection for EPO therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We emphasized that proper patient selection is necessary for a safe, effective program of EPO therapy at home. It is
necessary for the dialysis facility or the physician responsible for all dialysis-related services to assess_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Whether the patient will actually be able to administer the drug or have available the necessary assistance
from a care-giver; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the patient complies with certain elements necessary for successful EPO therapy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, we required that, in order to be selected for home use of EPO, a patient must_ 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Be a home dialysis patient (either peritoneal or hemodialysis method). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have a hematocrit (or comparable hemoglobin) of less than 30 percent unless medical documentation justifies
a patient's need for EPO with a hematocrit higher than 30 percent. For example, a patient with severe angina, severe
pulmonary disease, or severe hypotension may require EPO to prevent adverse symptoms even though the patient has
a higher hematocrit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Be under the care of the physician who is responsible for the dialysis-related services and who prescribes
EPO, and under the care of the renal dialysis facility that establishes the plan of care for the services and monitors
the progress of the home EPO therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Be trained by the facility to inject EPO or have an appropriate caregiver who is trained to inject EPO. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, as part of the assessment, we required the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The patient's hematocrit (or hemoglobin), serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and blood pressure
must be measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. An appropriate protocol, developed by the patient's physician or facility and including monitoring of blood pressure,
must be given to the patient for the safe and effective use of the drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The patient must be capable of performing self-administration of EPO, be able to learn aseptic technique, and be
able to read the drug labeling, or must have a primary care-giver who can perform these tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The patient must be able to adhere to a disciplined medical regimen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Patient care plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure adequate monitoring of home EPO therapy, we amended &sect;405.2137(b) to add a new paragraph (b)(7) which
requires that the patient plan for a home dialysis patient who uses EPO in the home include the following: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Review of diet and fluid modifications to monitor iron stores and hyperkalemia related to dietary indiscretion
or elevated blood pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reevaluation of the patient's dialysis prescription taking into account the patient's increased appetite
and red blood cell volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A method of teaching the patient to identify the signs and symptoms of hypotension and hypertension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The decrease or discontinuance of EPO if hypertension is uncontrolled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A method of followup on blood work and a means to keep the physician informed of the results. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Other concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to minimize possible abuse of EPO, we revised &sect;405.2163(g)(4) to require that the physician or facility
ensure that ``on hand'' EPO is limited to a two-month supply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also requested the public's views and suggestions regarding this policy, and any other issues, including whether
it is necessary to impose special storage requirements for safe-keeping of EPO, considering that the drug contains
no preservatives and that its presence might entail possible risks to children in the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Other minor changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also made minor changes to codify in the rules the coverage of EPO in general and to reflect the expansion of that coverage
to include EPO used at home by home dialysis patients. (As explained in the ``Background'' section of the preamble
to the interim rule, previous coverage of EPO was implemented through general instructions issued by HCFA, but not
reflected in the rules.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters, both nephrologists, recommended that EPO be given for patients with hematocrits greater than 30
percent, even up to 35 percent. One of the commenters stated that a hematocrit of 30 percent is not normal and that in
a male, for whom normal hematocrit would be closer to 40 percent, a 30 percent reading means that the individual is functioning
at three-quarters of his or her ability to do exercises as well as other things. That, combined with the chronic uremic
state, which all dialysis patients have, makes it much more difficult for these patients to function in a useful manner.
The commenter believes hematocrits closer to 35 percent would make much more sense for keeping these patients in a
normal state and making them generally much more functional. The other commenter stated that his dialysis center
is not required to justify continuation of EPO to patients with hematocrits of up to 35 percent. Commenters asked whether
justification would be required each month or a single letter of justification would suffice.

The drug labeling for EPO recommends dosage to maintain a patient's hematocrit in the range of 30&hyph;33 percent
(target range) with a maximum of 36 percent. It also states that the dose of EPO should be reduced when the hematocrit
reaches the target range of 30&hyph;33 percent or increases by more than 4 points in any two-week period. Therapy with
EPO can result in an abnormal increase in red blood cells if the hematocrit is not carefully monitored and the dose appropriately
adjusted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe we are justified in requiring a hematocrit of less than 30 percent for initiation of EPO therapy at home.
Thirty percent is the low end of the target range. Medical review guidelines in the manuals used by Medicare intermediaries
and carriers provide for payment of subsequent claims for EPO without documentation of medical necessity as long
as the hematocrit is below 36 percent. We have revised &sect;405.2163(g)(2) to clarify that the 30 percent hematocrit
threshold applies only to initiation of EPO therapy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, operating a renal dialysis program in a university hospital, pointed out that, due to the close working
relationship that exists between the renal physicians, dialysis staff and outpatient department, a physician may
order EPO for an ESRD patient, note that order in the patient's chart, and verbally inform the pharmacist of the order
without providing a written prescription. The commenter believes this procedure to be the norm. However, the fiscal
intermediary processing those claims will not pay for any claims for which a written prescription is not provided.
The commenter believes this process to be burdensome, especially since the order is documented in the patient's medical
chart. The commenter also asked whether there will be any policy affecting refillable prescriptions.

We are sympathetic to the concerns expressed by the commenter and remain sensitive to requirements that may appear
to be overly burdensome. However, we believe the intermediary is justified in requiring a written prescription.
While in the case the commenter presented it might seem to create additional paperwork, a written prescription protects
the pharmacist as well as providing a basis for payment by the intermediary. The intermediary or carrier has discretion
to determine whether to require documentation on refillable prescriptions on the basis of reasonableness and necessity.

The same commenter suggested that we establish more specific guidelines for ``regular monitoring'' of patients
who self-administer EPO, especially with regard to maximum hematocrit readings. Two commenters recommended including
guidelines similar to those in the manufacturer's labeling. Two other commenters suggested that we include a mechanism
for monitoring patient compliance such as the completion of a patient log.

The drug labeling for EPO provides general therapeutic guidelines with regard to the starting dose and maintenance
dose, as well as when the dose should be reduced or increased. We believe the labeling provides adequate guidelines
and that physicians should have the flexibility to interpret those guidelines with regard to their patients. Since
drug regimens will vary depending on the individual patient's prescribed plan of treatment, we do not wish to be overly
prescriptive with respect to specific monitoring protocols. We have, however, revised language at &sect;405.2163(g)(2)(iii)
to require that the physician follow the drug labeling instructions when monitoring the EPO home therapy as well as
in developing appropriate protocols. We also agree that a patient log is a valid means to monitor compliance. To encourage
use of that mechanism or similar effective mechanisms, we have added ``(such as a patient log)'' in &sect;405.2137(b)(7).

prior to dialysis, required because of temporary patient weakness or a low hematocrit reading.

Medicare eligibility based on ESRD is not established until the patient has been undergoing routine dialysis for
three months or has a kidney transplant. Thus it is unlikely that a patient undergoing EPO therapy before dialysis
would be a Medicare beneficiary. However, if a beneficiary whose Medicare eligibility is based on age or disability
receives EPO for either of the types of anemia listed on the drug labeling, the drug may be covered if furnished ``incident
to a physician's service''. Routine documentation requirements for this treatment include appropriate diagnostic
coding on the HCFA&hyph;1500 claim form filed by the physician.

One commenter stated that the rule implies that home dialysis patients have not been receiving EPO and that the need
for EPO must be evaluated for each patient. The commenter points out that many patients have met the criteria for EPO,
have been monitored monthly by appropriate laboratory tests and frequent blood pressure checks, and may already
have been determined to have hematocrits within the target range. The commenter recommended that we not require full
evaluation of patients who are already on EPO.

We realize that a patient who is receiving EPO may have a hematocrit within the target range of 30&hyph;33 percent.
We also realize that any patient considered for home use of EPO would be under the care of a physician who furnishes all
dialysis-related services. We assume that, in determining whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for home
use, the physician would take into account any previous evaluations and whether the patient is currently receiving
EPO. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that every patient must be evaluated before being approved for home use
of EPO. The physician may base the evaluation in part on information previously obtained in the course of monitoring
dialysis, but must also evaluate other factors, such as competence to inject the drug and capacity for proper storage
of the drug, that are not pertinent to receiving EPO in a facility or a physician's office.

One commenter believes that home health agencies (HHAs) should not have to adhere to the standard of ensuring that
the two-month supply limitation is met, especially in a patient's own household. The commenter believes that such
a standard could impose on the HHA inappropriate and unwarranted liability, especially since EPO is a drug that allegedly
``may be abused.'' The same commenter also requested that the phrase, ``in the judgment of the home health agency,''
be inserted after the word ``patient'' in &sect;405.2163(g)(2) to prevent reviewing agencies from alleging that
the patient did not have the abilities necessary to self-administer EPO.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;405.2163 (g)(2) and (h)(3), the patient's physician or dialysis facility (and not the supplier) is responsible
for ensuring that the patient is capable of self-administering the drug and, through the drug prescriptions, that
the amount ``on hand'' does not exceed a 2-month supply. Accordingly, if an HHA qualifies to be a supplier of home dialysis
equipment and supplies, that HHA would not be subject to the responsibilities that aroused the commenter's concern.
Ordinarily, HHAs would not be involved in monitoring self-administration of EPO.

One professional association commented that the wording in &sect;405.2163(g)(2)(iii), that is, ``being able to

We agree that the cited current language lacks specificity and have removed it. However, we did not add the suggested
language because, in this context, it is training in the self-administration of EPO (rather than in self-dialysis
as such) that is pertinent, and that is already dealt with in paragraph (g)(3).

Three commenters, all renal dietitians, questioned the wording of the requirement to review a patient's diet and
fluid modifications to monitor adequate iron stores and hyperkalemia. All commented that the amount of iron required
during EPO therapy can rarely be met with dietary iron, since such diets are typically iron deficient. They noted that
oral or even intravenous supplemental iron is required and recommended that we revise the language to include the

units was effective January 1, 1991. However, under section 4201(d) of that Act, coverage of EPO self-administered
at home by home dialysis patients is effective July 1, 1991. Thus, Medicare payment is available for services that
are furnished on or after that date and that also meet the requirements of the interim final rule published on September
4, 1991.

 Two commenters felt that an initial 2-month EPO supply might be too much since (1) patients who receive the drug from
a renal facility must be seen by their physician monthly and (2) a 2-month supply might discourage patients from maintaining
blood pressure and hematocrit monitoring. The commenters were also concerned that the supplier or renal facility
may be requested to take back unused portions of EPO, if the home dialysis patient received a kidney transplant or died
soon after receiving the supply. They suggested that a smaller quantity would alleviate the beneficiary's coinsurance
responsibility.

 First, we note that the provision sets the 2-month initial supply as a maximum limit, to be used when circumstances
make a 2-month supply appropriate. We recognize that patients who obtain their supplies directly must be monitored
monthly, and we would expect a physician to prescribe a lesser amount for some patients. In &sect;405.2163, we have
added a paragraph (h) to highlight the responsibilities of the physician and the dialysis facility. Paragraph (h)(3)
makes clear that the 2-month supply is a maximum.

The commenter has misinterpreted the intent of the policy. The intent is not to require a ``minimum'' 2-month supply,
but rather to ensure that the patient has at least a 1-month supply. As stated above, the physician may initially prescribe
``up to'' a 2-month supply. When half of the initial 2-month supply is used, the next 1-month supply may be ordered,
and so on.

 We agree that patients need to be properly trained in the self-administration of EPO; however, we do not believe that
we should set a specific minimum time limit for training as suggested by the commenter. We believe there should be sufficient
flexibility to allow for differences in individual patients' learning ability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no separate payment for training or retraining in, and monitoring of, home use of EPO. A patient should be trained
to self-administer EPO as part of the home dialysis training program that is paid for at the home dialysis training
composite rate in accordance with &sect;413.170 of the HCFA rules. With respect to monitoring self-administration
of EPO, we believe the additional physician's time and effort are minimal and should be subsumed within the physician's
monthly capitation payment under &sect;414.314 of those rules.

 Payment for the medical supplies needed for administration of EPO, whether in the home or in a facility, is included
in the Medicare payment rate for EPO. Both before OBRA '90 and since the implementation of those provisions, HCFA has
always included the cost of supplies as part of the Medicare payment for EPO. We see no basis for different treatment
of supplies for self-administration of EPO in the home. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The payment rate for EPO is $11.00 per 1,000 units and, we believe, is more than adequate to cover the minimal cost of
supplies (less than 20 cents per administration). The manufacturer of EPO is protected from competition for seven
years by the Orphan Drug Act. The company reports substantial profits and gives rebates to facilities depending upon
usage. It appears that facilities pay considerably less for EPO than the Medicare rate, providing sufficient payment
for supplies needed for administration.

One commenter was of the opinion that there is no statutory authority for the provision in &sect;413.170(c)(6)) requiring
suppliers to accept assignment of benefits for EPO.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory provisions for payment of benefits for EPO are in section 1881(b)(1). Section 1881(b)(1)(B) of the
Act provides for payments ``to or in behalf of'' beneficiaries for home dialysis supplies and equipment. However,
with respect to payment for self-administered EPO, section 1881(b)(1)(C) permits payment only to a supplier of home
dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician. There
is no authority in the law to pay this benefit to a beneficiary. Therefore, the law implicitly requires payment to a
supplier under assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, any other reading of the statute would have anomalous results. For example, if the statute did not require
suppliers to accept assignment, the beneficiary would be protected for charges for home dialysis supplies and equipment,
but not for EPO furnished directly by the supplier. Nothing in the legislative history suggests the Congress intended
such a result.

Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any document that meets one of the E.O. 12866
criteria for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, we determined that a regulatory impact analysis was not required for these rules because they
would not have an annual impact of $100 million or more or meet any of the other threshold criteria. However, we indicated
our intention to include in the final rule a cost and benefit analysis that considers the social benefits to Medicare
beneficiaries who use EPO at home. We asked for specific comments concerning benefits from home administration of
EPO. We listed, as examples of these benefits, savings in travel and transportation costs previously required to
obtain EPO or the ability of the beneficiary to resume employment. We also requested public comment on any benefits
and costs that may be anticipated as a result of this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received concerning the benefits of self-administration of EPO or on any portion of the impact analysis.
Thus, we have prepared an analysis based on our review of data available to us and of pertinent literature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following chart summarizes home dialysis beneficiary records for the period February 28, 1991 through February
29, 1992. It reflects the most current data on file and also encompasses the time immediately before and after July
1, 1991, the effective data of coverage of home administration of EPO. We identified, as ESRD beneficiaries who are
potentially eligible for home use of EPO, beneficiaries who have completed the necessary home dialysis training
or were home dialysis patients during this period. The chart indicates the number of beneficiaries on home dialysis
and the number receiving EPO therapy as of June 30, 1991. The same information is shown for the billing period November
1, 1991 through January 31, 1992, the most current billing information for home dialysis beneficiaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Our records indicate that as of June 30, 1991 there were 38,515 beneficiaries that dialyzed at home. Before coverage
of home administration of EPO, 12,733 of these beneficiaries received EPO in the ESRD facility or in a physician's
office. As a result of coverage of home administration of EPO, 1,656 beneficiaries or 4.3 percent of home dialysis
beneficiaries self-administer EPO. We estimate that this number will increase as more beneficiaries become qualified
to self-administer EPO and realize the benefits of home administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In attempting to perform a cost-benefit analysis, we reviewed three published reports and one unpublished report.
We also relied upon billing information submitted by intermediaries. Average expenditure for ESRD beneficiaries
receiving EPO therapy approximate $6,900 exclusive of dialysis treatment. This amount includes the cost of the drug
and other services such as iron treatment and hypertension therapy. The average annual cost for patients not using
EPO approximates $450, exclusive of dialysis treatments, and includes the cost of other services such as blood transfusions
and hepatitis therapy. The annual expenditures for EPO users represent very gross estimates. More definitive cost
data and experience with the administration of EPO is needed in order to permit analysis of actual costs and EPO's relative
effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned earlier in this preamble, use of EPO by chronic renal failure patients reduces or eliminates the need
for blood transfusions. EPO also reduces the recipients' risk of transfusion-related illnesses. The transmission
of non-A, non-B hepatitis is of greatest concern (see ``Recombinant Human Erythropoietin: Factors to Consider in
Cost-Benefit Analysis'', American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol. XVII, No. 1, January 1991). Although rare, the
threat of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis B should also be considered. For ESRD patients
receiving EPO, the risk of hepatitis infection related to transfusions has been reduced from 13.8 to 4.5 percent because
the patient's need for blood transfusions has been reduced and in some cases eliminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Reducing the need for transfusions also increases kidney transplant success in chronic renal failure patients by
reducing sensitization. According to the above cited article, some individuals receiving frequent transfusions
may develop cytotoxic antibodies. Excessive cytotoxity levels may result in increased waiting time for suitable
organs. Also, when high cytotoxity levels are present, graft survival rates are reduced. When EPO is used, thus reducing
or eliminating the need for transfusions, patients are more likely to retain transplanted organs successfully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other potential benefits associated with the use of EPO. Since EPO stimulates the production of red blood
cells thereby reducing or eliminating anemia, the need for hospitalization due to anemia or anemia-related illnesses
could be expected to decline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another very important though not quantifiable benefit of receiving EPO is improved quality of life. An article appearing
in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) (The Quality of Life of Hemodialysis Recipients Treated
with Recombinant Human Erythropoietin, Vol. 263, No. 6, February 9, 1990) reported on the results of a study of over
300 hemodialysis patients in nine dialysis centers. The study showed that hemodialysis patients receiving EPO are
happier_their energy levels are higher, physical functioning is improved, physical activity levels are increased,
etc. Similar results were also reported in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases article mentioned earlier in this
impact statement. Although these studies did not specifically study home dialysis patients, we believe that results
would be equally true for this group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the literature on EPO, we also found that most EPO recipients require additional medications or therapies
to counteract possible adverse effects. Some of the possible side effects of EPO therapy are iron depletion, hypertension,
and arteriovenous graft clotting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Iron Depletion_EPO recipients may not get the full benefit of increased hematocrits from EPO if they lack sufficient
iron reserves. EPO increases the body's production of red blood cells. This requires sufficient iron reserves. Consequently,
patients on EPO may become iron deficient. Their iron reserves must be monitored and iron supplements administered
to ensure that the patient's iron reserves are not depleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hypertension_Use of EPO may elevate a patient's blood pressure, a reaction that may be related to the rate of increase
in hematocrit. Therefore, an EPO patient's blood pressure must be carefully monitored. Thirty percent of all EPO
patients receive hypertension therapy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arteriovenous (AV) Graft Clotting_Fourteen percent of all EPO patients experience clotting of AV graft as compared
to 6 percent of chronic renal patients not receiving EPO. The cause of the AV clotting is believed due to increased hematocrit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foregoing benefits and adverse effects of using EPO are the same for patients who receive the drug in a physician's
office or ESRD facility as for patients who self-administer the drug. Those beneficiaries who received EPO in a physician's
office or ESRD facility and, as a result of this regulation, shift to self-administration will realize further benefits,
such as savings of time and in transportation costs. In order to receive the full benefit of EPO therapy, most patients
receive it at least three times a week. Therefore, we estimate that the savings in transportation costs will average
approximately $300 per beneficiary for calendar year 1992. Of course, this estimate is only an average; the actual
saving will vary depending on distance traveled to and from the ESRD facility or physician's office by a particular
beneficiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since EPO is a relatively new drug, definitive information on its large scale effectiveness, direct costs, savings,
etc., is not available. Literature supports the view that ESRD beneficiaries receiving EPO experience an improved
quality of life, resulting in higher energy levels and improved physical functioning. For those beneficiaries who
did receive EPO in a physician's office or ESRD facility and meet the criteria for self-administration, the change
to self-administration will save time and eliminate travel expenses associated with office and facility visits.
We expect that over time more home dialysis beneficiaries who did not receive EPO or received a reduced dosage because
they were unable to travel to the physician's office or ESRD facility as often as needed will become candidates for
self-administration of EPO. We do not have data on which to base a prediction of the number who will choose this form
of administration. Obviously, each beneficiary's physician will need to consider potential adverse as well as beneficial
effects.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 602 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, individuals are not considered to be small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary
certifies, that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and
will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make a comprehensive assessment that includes the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-selection monitoring. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The patient's hematocrit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or hemoglobin), serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ferritin, and blood pressure must be measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions the patient must meet. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find that the patient meets the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is a home dialysis patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Has a hematocrit (or comparable hemoglobin level) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For a patient who is initiating EPO treatment, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than 30 percent unless there is medical documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showing the need for EPO despite a hematocrit (or comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemoglobin level) higher than 30 percent. (Patients with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe angina, severe pulmonary distress, or severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hypertension may require EPO to prevent adverse symptoms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even if they have higher hematocrit or hemoglobin levels.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For a patient who has been receiving EPO from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or the physician, between 30 and 33 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is under the care of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A physician who is responsible for all dialysis-related services and who prescribes the EPO and follows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug labeling instructions when monitoring the EPO home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therapy; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A renal dialysis facility that establishes the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of care and monitors the progress of the home EPO therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions the patient or the patient's caregiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must meet. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment must find that the patient or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caregiver who assists the patient in performing self-dialysis meets the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is trained by the facility to inject EPO and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of carrying out the procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is capable of reading and understanding the drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is trained in, and capable of observing, aseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Care and storage of drug. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find that EPO can be stored in the patient's residence under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration and that the patient is aware of the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard of a child's having access to the drug and syringes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of EPO at home: Responsibilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician or the dialysis facility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The patient's physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or dialysis facility must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Develop a protocol that follows the drug label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make the protocol available to the patient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure safe and effective home use of EPO; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Through the amounts prescribed, ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug ``on hand'' at any time does not exceed a 2-month supply.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of recent legislation, certain private land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as commercial
mobile radio service licensees and will be subject to foreign ownership restrictions within the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission has now established a procedure by which such licensees may file a waiver petition
with the Commission to request retention of existing foreign ownership that would otherwise not be permitted. Such
waiver petitions must be received at the Commission by February 10, 1994.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. On September 23, 1993, we adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 in which we proposed, inter alia, to establish a procedure by which private land mobile radio licensees that will be
reclassified as commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers pursuant to this rule making proceeding could
file a waiver petition to retain existing foreign ownership. We now establish the filing procedure for these waiver
petitions and remind all potentially affected licensees of the February 10, 1994, filing deadline. We also emphasize
that filing such a petition will not prejudice the licensee's right at a later date to assert that it should not be classified
as a CMRS provider.

2. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 amended sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n), 332 (Communications
Act), to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. ``[A]ny provider of a private
land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993'' is subject to the foreign ownership restrictions imposed on common carriers by section 310(b) of the
Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 310(b).
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Nevertheless, the statute allows affected licensees to petition the Commission for waiver of the application of
section 310(b) to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed as of May 24, 1993. The statute requires that these petitions
for waiver be filed with the Commission by February 10, 1994 (within 6 months of enactment of the Budget Act). The Commission
may grant such waivers to eligible petitioners only upon the following conditions:

In regard to condition (B), the legislative history of the amended statute states: ``In effect, this condition ``grandfathers''
only the particular person who holds the foreign ownership on May 24, 1993; the ``grandfathering'' does not transfer
to any future foreign owners.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 213, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 495 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S. Code

the laws of a foreign country, if the Commission finds that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation
of such license.

4. The Notice proposed to establish a petition procedure to allow licensees to ``grandfather'' their foreign ownership.
Under this procedure, petitioners would be required to (1) identify all foreign persons or entities holding an interest
in the licensee and the percentage of ownership interest for each; and (2) certify that the identity and level of foreign
ownership are unchanged since May 24, 1993, and that no change will occur in the future (other than divestiture of a
foreign ownership interest to a domestic person or entity) without prior notice to the Commission.

5. The Notice indicated that we intend to place the burden on licensees to file petitions, regardless of whether we
have made a final determination as to whether the licensee is subject to reclassification as a CMRS provider. Furthermore,
the Notice stated that while the filing of a petition would not prejudice a licensee's future arguments as to whether
it should be reclassified, licensees who failed to file a timely petition would be subject to immediate enforcement
of our foreign ownership restrictions.

6. A single commenter responded to this issue. Roamer One, Inc., argues that the Notice misread the Budget Act's amendment
to the Communications Act to the extent that it imposes ``immediate'' foreign ownership restrictions on all private
radio licensees.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 It maintains that while the Notice refers to private land mobile service providers that ``may'' be treated as common
carriers, the statute refers to existing private land mobile service providers that ``will'' be treated as common
carriers as a result of the enactment of the Budget Act.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 It contends that, prior to the completion of this rule making proceeding, the Commission may not impose alien ownership
restrictions on private radio licensees who are unlikely to be classified as CMRS providers.

7. Initially, we agree with Roamer One that Section 332(c)(6) does not impose foreign ownership restrictions on all
private radio licensees. As noted above, the foreign ownership restrictions apply only to those current private
land mobile service providers that ``will be'' classified as CMRS providers ``as a result of enactment of the [Budget
Act].'' As we discussed in the Notice, a private land mobile radio licensee could potentially be reclassified as a
CMRS licensee if it meets two criteria: Its service: (1) Is ``provided for profit,'' and (2) makes ``interconnected
service'' available ``to the public'' or ``to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial
portion of the public.'' In addition, it is possible that a service might not fully satisfy the two criteria, but nonetheless
be classified as CMRS if the Commission were to find that the service is the ``functional equivalent'' of CMRS.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 If a licensee determines that there is a possibility that it will be reclassified as a CMRS provider, it must also determine
whether its foreign ownership as of May 24, 1993, would be prohibited under section 310(b).

8. Final rules governing regulatory classification of mobile services may not be available on or before the February
10, 1994, filing deadline. We recognize that this presents private land mobile licensees with the potentially difficult
decision of whether they should file petitions for waiver. Therefore, in instances where there is any chance at all
that the licensee might later be classified as a CMRS provider, we strongly encourage the licensee to err on the side
of filing and thereby preserve all of its rights under the new statutory provisions. Similarly, if a licensee is uncertain
of whether it would be affected by section 310(b) restrictions absent a waiver, we strongly recommend that the licensee
file a petition.

9. As noted above, section 332(c)(6) permits the Commission to grant waiver petitions only where two conditions are
met. First, the waiver can only cover ``the [licensee's] extent of foreign ownership interest [that has] not *&blank;*&blank;*
increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.'' Consistent with the legislative history quoted previously
(see note 4, supra), we interpret this language to refer to the precise identities of persons or entities and not merely
to preexisting levels of foreign ownership interests. Petitioners must therefore identify in their petitions all
foreign interests in the licensee as of May 24, 1993, that would, absent a waiver, be subject to the section 310(b) restrictions
and for which a waiver is sought. For instance, except as noted below, petitioners should specifically identify all
foreign persons or entities holding an ownership interest in the licensee and the percentage of ownership interest
of each and identify all foreign partners,
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 officers, and directors, regardless of whether they have any ownership interest. While we will not require publicly
traded corporations
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 to identify each foreign stockholder in instances where this requirement would be especially onerous,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 we note that it is the responsibility of all petitioners to ensure that all foreign ownership listed in the petition,
including that held by individual stockholders, did exist as of May 24, 1993, and to retain documentation substantiating
that ownership.

Petitioners must list all foreign partners regardless of whether they are general or limited partners, except that
petitioners need not list a limited partner (1) whose level of ownership interest in the licensee does not exceed the
level allowed by section 310(b), and (2) who is ``insulated'' from the management and control of the partnership.

an onerous burden to explain why identifying individual shareholders would be extraordinarily burdensome.

10. The second condition is that the waiver cannot permit any ``subsequent transfer of ownership to any other person
in violation of section 310(b).'' We interpret ``subsequent'' here to mean subsequent to May 24, 1993. Petitioners
must therefore certify in their petitions that the identity and percentages of each listed component of foreign ownership
are unchanged since May 24, 1993, and that each listed foreign officer, director or partner continues to hold the same
position. The waiver can recognize only the particular person or entity that held the ownership interest on May 24,
1993; it cannot recognize any subsequent transfers to other foreign owners or foreign officers or directors.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 If, following the grant of a waiver in light of the above condition, a licensee wishes to transfer ``grandfathered''
foreign ownership interests, the waiver will remain valid (for the remaining ``grandfathered'' interests) only
if the transfer is made to a domestic person or entity.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The same is true for ``grandfathered'' partners, officers, and directors.

See note 4, supra. Thus, transfers to aliens that occurred after May 24 are not covered by the grandfathering provisions
of the Budget Act even if they occurred before the Budget Act was enacted on August 10, 1993. Where such a transfer is
found to create an ownership interest in violation of section 310(b), the licensee will be required to comply with
section 310(b) with respect to that interest, regardless of whether alien ownership in the licensee that existed
prior to May 24 is grandfathered.

11. Roamer One appears to object to our statement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that ``all reclassifiable private licensees are

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 subject to the foreign ownership restrictions on common carriers by section 310(b).''
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 As noted above, Roamer One contends that, prior to the completion of this rule making proceeding, the Commission should
not impose alien ownership restrictions on private radio licensees who are unlikely to be classified as CMRS providers.
We agree that the restrictions in section 310(b) would only apply to licensees that are actually reclassified pursuant
to the statute and its implementation in this rule making. Section 310(b) does not and will not apply to private land
mobile radio licensees who will not be reclassified as CMRS providers. On the other hand, the statute does require
immediate enforcement of section 310(b) for private land mobile providers that are reclassified as CMRS. Section
6002(c)(2)(B) of the Budget Act states:

Accordingly, as stated above, licensees that may be reclassified should file a timely waiver request to grandfather

12. In light of the above, we adopt the following petitioning procedure. First, petitions should be in an informal,

Petitions must clearly specify the licensee's name, radio service, call sign(s), station address(es) or geographical
location(s), and contact person with telephone number. Petitions must specifically request a waiver of section
310(b), identify the particular subsection(s) of section 310(b) for which the waiver is requested, and state that
the waiver is sought under section 332(c)(6). The original copy of the waiver petition must be signed by the licensee,
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 and this signature will be taken to certify that all statements made in the petition are true, complete, correct, and
made in good faith.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Chapter Ten of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act of 1993 requires the United States,
Canada, and Mexico to eliminate ``buy national'' restrictions on non-defense related purchases by the federal governments.
NAFTA is being implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation but also requires revision of the DFARS to integrate
Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program waivers necessitated by NAFTA with similar existing Department
of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda of understanding or other international agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The interim rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the rule waives the Buy American Act for certain Mexican and Canadian products. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration.
Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subpart will be considered in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;610 in correspondence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act applies because the provisions at 252.225&hyph;7006, Buy American Act-Trade Agreements-Balance
of Payments Program Certificate, and 252.225&hyph;7035, Buy American Act-North American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act-Balance of Payments Program Certificate, require offerors to list the line item number and country
of origin for any end product other than a domestic end product. Accordingly, a request for clearance of a new information
collection requirement concerning the North American Free Trade Agreement Act is being submitted to the Office of
Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule.
Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment.
This action is necessary because the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, signed into law on December
8, 1993, becomes effective on January 1, 1994. However, pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577 and Federal Acquisition
Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the
final rule.

Foreign end products subject to the Trade Agreements Act and NAFTA are those in the following Federal supply groups
(FSG). If a product is not in one of the listed groups, the Trade Agreements Act and NAFTA do not apply. As noted in FAR
25.401, Caribbean Basin country end products are limited to those end products which are eligible for duty-free treatment
under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). The list of products has been annotated to indicate those products which, due to this limitation,
are eligible for designated and NAFTA countries, but are not presently eligible for Caribbean Basin countries.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State-Administered Workplace Literacy Program and the National Workplace Literacy Program are important activities
that assist in achieving the National Education Goals. Specifically, the workplace literacy programs address Goal
5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global
economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Moreover, the National Workplace Literacy
Program supports this goal by providing grants to exemplary partnerships between a business, industry, or labor
organization, or a private industry council, and an education organization to support work-related literacy education.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations increase the accountability of workplace literacy projects. The Department is implementing
this strategy in order to expand the demonstration and dissemination activities of projects, thereby increasing
the number of instructional approaches, materials, and techniques for providing work-related literacy education
that are submitted to and approved by the Department's Program Effectiveness Panel, and subsequently made available
to practitioners.

For five years the Secretary has required, under the National Workplace Literacy Program, the types of binding agreements
that would become part of the State-Administered program. The Secretary's experience is that these agreements are
essential to eliciting quality applications, promoting project success, and ensuring accountable grant performance.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter mistakenly thought the proposed change, which would clarify that employment and training agencies
are nonprofit agencies, would exclude from participation as partners profit-making organizations that provide
employment and training services. Other commenters agreed with the proposed change to the definition of ``employment
and training agency.''

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would codify an existing program practice that requires an education partner classified as an
employment and training agency to be a nonprofit entity. However, profit-makers can continue to participate as partners
under the classification ``business'' or ``industry'' organization. See &sect;472.2(a)(1). Profit-making organizations
should note that a selection criterion in &sect;472.22(c)(4) requests applications to indicate the extent to which
training will be provided through the education partner classified under &sect;472.2(a)(2), rather than through
the business or labor partner classified under &sect;472.2(a)(1), unless transferring this activity to the business
or labor partner is necessary and reasonable within the framework of the applicant's proposed project.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters supported the regulations defining the term ``project director'' and requiring that each project
provide for a director. Some of these commenters recommended additional regulations, including requiring a full-time
project director, specifying the qualifications of a project director, and requiring that proposed personnel demonstrate
substantive experience, education, and training in the workplace.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the project director will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the project, the qualifications
of that person should be directly related to the specific requirements of the project, and will naturally differ somewhat
from project to project. The Secretary strongly encourages applicants to hire project directors with experience
and training in project management and in fields related to objectives of the project, but believes that a list of standardized
qualifications would limit the discretion of applicant partnerships to hire directors who respond to the needs of
the project. The regulations do not specifically require a full-time project director, and this may not be needed_especially
in small projects. However, each project must provide for a director who will devote sufficient time to exercising
day-to-day operational responsibility and ensure that the project is well managed.

One commenter suggested retaining &sect;&sect;472.10 and 472.11, which describe a preapplication process, because
the process would save time for projects that might not be appropriate for a national competition. Another commenter
supported the Department's proposal to delete these sections because a preapplication would be a burdensome paperwork
requirement.

its use in the future.

Preference for Small Business Partners (&sect;472.21(e))

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter agreed that preference points should be given for applications involving a small business, but thought
that the points should be given even if the business is not involved as a project partner. The commenter stated that
it is unrealistic to expect small businesses to become partners because this would burden them with paperwork, meetings,
and unnecessary reports. Another commenter suggested giving an additional preference to partnerships involving
small businesses with less than 100 or 250 employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small business can potentially be involved in a workplace literacy project as a ``partner,'' a ``contractor,''
a ``helping organization,'' or a ``site.'' Each of these terms is defined in 34 CFR 472.5, which clarifies that only
a partner can receive program funds and be fully involved in project policy and operations. The Secretary believes
that preference should be given only to those partnerships that include small businesses as partners. To interpret
the preference more broadly would benefit applications that involve large businesses as partners_and merely involve
small businesses in a less significant role. Each partnership agreement designates one of the partners to serve as
the project grantee. This partner is principally responsible for project administration, including paperwork
and reports. Any small business partner that does not wish to serve as a grantee can enter into an agreement designating
another partner as the grantee, and can thus avoid the paperwork burden. The Secretary has adopted a definition of
the term ``small business'' modeled on regulations of the Small Business Administration and does not believe it would
be beneficial to modify that definition by giving an additional preference to small businesses having particularly
small numbers of employees.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 472.22(a)(5) proposed adding language to a selection criterion encouraging applicants to focus ``on improving
performance in jobs or job functions that have a broad representation within the Nation's workforce so that the products
can be adapted for use by similar workplaces across the Nation.'' Several commenters interpreted this language as
a statement of the scope of services that are allowable under the National Workplace Literacy Program, believed that
this scope had been defined too narrowly, and urged that it be expanded to include a variety of activities. It was also
suggested that a project be permitted to provide any services identified in a needs assessment. One commenter asked
whether use of the term ``jobs or job functions'' was intended to shift focus away from job-specific competencies
of current job titles to broader competencies that are identified in the report issued by the Department of Labor Secretary's
Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS). The commenter asked that the Department clarify or define which
jobs or job functions have ``broad representation within the Nation's workforce.'' Other commenters stated that
a broader scope of services is needed to meet the National Education Goals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 472.22(a)(5) is a selection criterion used to evaluate applications and is not a statement of the scope of
allowable program services. That scope is stated in &sect;472.3, which reflects sections 371(a)(1) and (3) of the
Adult Education Act, and lists allowable activities. Many activities mentioned by the commenters, such as speaking,
listening, reasoning, problem-solving, team building, GED preparation, and meeting the literacy needs of adults
with limited English proficiency, are allowable under &sect;472.3. Further guidance on the scope of allowable activities
is included in the notice inviting applications published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Generally, workplace literacy projects teach literacy skills needed in the workplace that improve the productivity
of the workforce. The program is not a program of general adult education and cannot serve needs that are not directly
related to the workplace. At the same time, projects serving needs that are directly related to the workplace are encouraged
to use creative approaches to stimulate workers' interests and to develop individualized education plans that reflect
workers' goals. See &sect;472.22(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the language encouraging a focus on nationally representative jobs or job functions is to enhance the
capability of a project to demonstrate results that can be adapted by similar employers and industries. Section 472.22(a)(5)
was not proposed specifically to respond to the recommendations of the SCANS report, nor was the report intended to
modify the scope of services under the workplace literacy program. The Secretary believes that it is unnecessary
to define by regulation what jobs or job functions are broadly representative. Applicants are encouraged to make
their own evaluation of current and future labor market conditions, and design a project that can help similar workplaces
in the future. This should assist in meeting National Education Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters agreed that the Department should emphasize dissemination activities, and recommended the
inclusion of various other dissemination strategies. Two commenters were concerned that dissemination activities
could be hampered because the instructional materials produced by a project might contain protected information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that, because carrying out both the demonstration and commitment activities described
in proposed &sect;472.22(h)(1) and (2) would be overwhelming, applicants should be asked to address only one of these
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The dissemination strategies listed in proposed &sect;472.22(h)(1) are among the regulatory changes designed
to transform the National Workplace Literacy Program into a true demonstration program. See the previous discussion
of the background of these regulations and note also &sect;472.31(c), which requires that a project be independently
evaluated for ``spread'' and ``transportability'' to other sites. Proposed &sect;472.22(h)(1) encouraged applicants
to use certain dissemination strategies but was not intended to preclude the use of additional strategies when they
are appropriate for a particular project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not expect or anticipate that partnerships will disseminate trade secrets or other protected
information. However, a project's dissemination activities should clearly benefit businesses and workplaces
outside of the partnership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, ideally, all partners will be involved in demonstration and commitment activities, these activities may
be accomplished through the efforts of particular partners. The Secretary desires that the factors listed in the
criteria on ``Demonstration'' and ``Commitment'' be reflected in an applicant's program design, management plan,
and budget. However, the Secretary does not anticipate that addressing both criteria will be burdensome if partners
adequately plan and budget for them.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters opposed the criterion that encouraged applicants to state how partners plan to establish a program
of workplace literacy services that can continue after Federal funding ends. Many of these commenters believed this
criterion would adversely affect small businesses since they might not have the resources needed to continue a workplace
literacy project. Other commenters pointed out that some businesses, especially small businesses, have short-term
training needs that can be met during the course of the project and, therefore, would not need to continue the project.
Still other commenters thought that because small businesses would not be able to continue a project, this criterion
would nullify the five-point preference given for partnerships that include a small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the inclusion of the criterion on commitment and indicated past success with this concept,
but suggested that small businesses be exempted. Other commenters believed that expecting business partners to
make a commitment to continue a project that is unproven is unreasonable and could scare away potential business partners.
These commenters thought that commitment is best sought and obtained during a successful project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested such alternative methods of demonstrating commitment as release time for assessment
and training, strategic planning for capacity-building, training business partners to provide workplace literacy,
active participation of all partners, or gradual assumption of costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary acknowledges the many helpful comments on this topic. Although proposed &sect;472.22(h)(2) did not
involve a commitment to any unforeseeable or unnecessary post-project activities, the Secretary wishes to avoid
any implication that this is the case. The Secretary also desires to preserve the competitive preference for partnerships
involving small businesses. Accordingly, the selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed
&sect;472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in &sect;472.22(h) and a criterion on
``Commitment'' in &sect;472.22(i). Moreover, &sect;472.22(i) makes it clear that plans for continuing workplace
literacy after Federal funding ends should be based on realistic forecasts of the literacy needs of partners and should
take into consideration a partner's capacity to continue services. To emphasize this point, the criterion now provides
a range of examples of practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy, many of which can be carried
out by small businesses. The criterion also recognizes the importance of an applicant's commitment to institutionalizing
learning in the workplace specifically during the project itself. These changes are intended to accommodate the
legitimate concerns of the commenters while preserving the overall purpose of a selection criterion on commitment.
The recently published study Adult Literacy in America points out that some 90 million adults demonstrate low levels
of literacy and depicts a society in which the vast majority of Americans do not have the skills needed to earn a living
in our increasingly technological society and international marketplace. The Secretary believes that a commitment
to institutionalize learning will naturally lead to continuing efforts to promote workplace literacy after Federal
funding ends and will assist in transforming American workplaces to meet the challenges of a world market.

The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed &sect;472.22(h) has been separated into
a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in &sect;472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in &sect;472.22(i). The
criterion on ``Commitment'' clarifies that applicants are to develop practical strategies for institutionalizing
workplace literacy that are based on realistic forecasts of literacy needs and the capacity of partners. The criterion
also encourages applicants to demonstrate a commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace during
the project.

Numerous commenters expressed the view that a two-page semi-annual performance and financial report would not be
overly burdensome. These commenters felt that the data would be a good planning tool, would help projects monitor
their progress, and would contribute to the standardization of the workplace literacy program nationwide. Other
commenters suggested that the reports be made available at the time of award so that data bases could be designed to
facilitate collection. Some commenters strongly advocated quarterly reports that include, in addition to the information
the Secretary proposed collecting, a brief update on the success of the project in achieving its objectives. Two commenters
recommended annual reporting, one because of the project's cycle for collecting evaluative data and the other because
of the possibility that the Department might not have adequate staff resources to use the performance and financial
data as intended.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary considered requiring quarterly reports for the National Workplace Literacy Program, but determined
that they would be burdensome for grantees. However, the Secretary believes that annual reports would not provide
sufficient information to ensure program accountability and ready access to information that is comparable across
projects. Grantees will be required to submit brief continuation applications annually in order to receive funding
for the second and third year of their projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the continuation application and a two-page semi-annual report on progress and total
spending for the reporting period will be adequate. The reports will be made available to grantees at the start of their
projects to enable them to set up appropriate recordkeeping procedures, and the Department will work with grantees
to ensure that reports are used appropriately both to monitor and to improve projects.

Several commenters thought that the requirement for projects to have a third-party evaluator would be expensive,
burdensome, or too costly. Several other commenters supported the evaluation requirement because a rigorous evaluation
design is essential to demonstrating impact and replicable results and would strengthen projects. One commenter
was concerned that tying student learning gains to higher job productivity and performance would not result in reliable
or valid measures of the effectiveness of projects because learning gains are not the only conditions affecting these
factors.

Program experience over the life of the National Workplace Literacy Program indicates that a third-party evaluation
enhances the quality of a project without being expensive, burdensome, or too costly. The Secretary agrees with the
comment that multiple conditions, including learning gains, may contribute to measured improvements in job productivity
and performance. This comment supports the need for a rigorous evaluation design that includes, insofar as possible,
controls for other variables that may also contribute to the improvements measured. Evaluations of this rigor require
highly trained research and evaluation personnel who cannot always be found among staff persons employed within
funded projects.

The heightened emphasis on demonstration and dissemination activities requires lengthening the grant period to
three years, and, as necessary, lengthening the time needed to establish a project before services are provided to
adult workers. Although &sect;472.32(b)(1) permits applicants to take up to a six-month start-up period, &sect;472.32(b)(2)
requires applicants to ``minimize the start-up period, if any, proposed for their projects.''

One commenter suggested that the regulations specifically apply to business partners. Another commenter thought
the regulations favored projects with more than two partners, and requested greater flexibility in the renegotiation
of the scope of work of a grant. A commenter suggested that a project be allowed to continue despite the withdrawal of
a partner, even if the conditions of &sect;472.34 are not satisfied. One commenter inquired whether all, or only one,
of the conditions outlined in &sect;472.34 must be met by withdrawing partners.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although each partnership is required to designate one partner as its applicant and grantee, an award is made on the
basis of the partnership agreement that is signed by all members of the partnership and that binds the partners to every
statement and assurance made in the application, in addition to carrying out their respective roles. It is therefore
reasonable to expect that the approved scope of work will continue to be carried out if a partner withdraws, regardless
of the type of partner withdrawing or the number of partners in the original partnership. The regulations do not favor
projects with more than two partners. Section 472.34(b)(1) allows for the full substitution of a partner even in the
case of a two-party partnership so long as the partnership continues to meet the requirement in &sect;472.2(b) that
there be at least one education partner and one business or labor partner. The Secretary wishes to point out that the
conditions in &sect;472.34 are to be met by the remaining partners. They are not conditions to be met by the withdrawing
partners as suggested by the commenter. Moreover, all of the conditions described in &sect;472.34 must be met before
the Secretary will allow a project to continue.

Several commenters thought unions should be involved in the development and implementation of projects. Some of
these commenters recommended requiring a written statement indicating consultation with and concurrence by the
union. Others suggested requiring a statement from the union that it either agrees to full partnership with the education
partner and business partner or it acknowledges the collaboration between the education and business partner. One
commenter suggested that points be awarded to proposals with employer and union partnerships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that, in the absence of a union, workers should be involved in planning the project. Another
commenter suggested that points be awarded to applications_(1) with effective plans to involve workers in the educational
provider's decision-making process; and (2) that emphasize participatory teaching methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that union and worker involvement would improve the recruitment, interest, and commitment
of the workforce, and help to allay fears that a project would result in the loss of jobs for employees failing to demonstrate
learning gains.

Section 371(a)(1) of the Act permits, but does not require, a labor organization to be a partner in an application under
this program. This provision is reflected in &sect;472.2(a) and (b). As indicated in &sect;472.2(c), a labor organization,
like any partner, must participate in a joint application for funding and sign a partnership agreement. However,
the Secretary does not believe that a written statement regarding union consultation should be required of partnerships
that do not include a labor organization. Nevertheless, the Secretary encourages all partnerships to involve workers
and, as appropriate, labor organizations in matters related to the project. This arrangement should provide a number
of benefits, including allaying any concerns that workers may have about participating in a project.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The ACP is authorized generally by Sections 7&hyph;17 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act as amended
(the Act) (16 U.S.C. 22590g 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The program provides financial and technical assistance to encourage agricultural producers to voluntarily
perform enduring soil and water conservation, water quality, and pollution abatement measures, including practices
or programs which are deemed essential to maintain soil productivity, prevent soil depletion, maintain water quality,
or prevent increased cost of production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A WQIP is authorized by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3831 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, Congress funded WQIP as a part of the ACP. Accordingly, the WQIP is a voluntary incentive program conducted
pursuant to the Act to develop and implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural water quality protection plans on up to 10 million acres.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ECP is authorized by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This program is designed to provide cost-share assistance for emergency restoration work to meet only the critical
needs of agricultural producers due to drought or other natural disaster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FIP is authorized by section 4 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2103) and is designed
to increase the nation's supply of timber products from private nonindustrial forest lands. The purpose of FIP is
to encourage private landowners to apply forestry practices that will provide for afforestation of suitable open
lands and reforestation of cut-over or other nonstocked forest lands and to encourage intensive multi-purpose forest
resource management and protection so as to provide for cost-effective timber production and other related forest
resources needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation governing these programs is being restructured and simplified to provide an easier and more effective
structure for the use of this regulation. The ACP is being revised to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Incorporate several amendments that have been published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Incorporate the WQIP; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Clarify that producers wanting to participate with practice WP4, Agricultural Waste Control Facilities, must
have been in operation for at least 5 years; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Adjust the LTA payment limitation to reflect that the payment limitation shall be based on the number of years remaining
on the LTA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) reflect that payments shall be based on attribution. The ECP is being revised to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reflect that the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16 U.S.C. 2202) authorized assistance for confined livestock operations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Define land subject to frequent damage which is ineligible for cost-share assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, ACP practices are prioritized locally by county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation committees
to ensure that the most severe conservation and environmental problems are addressed. However, this county committee
prioritization process has been criticized as not addressing the most severe conservation and environmental problems.
Therefore, comments are requested regarding the manner in which ACP practices and allocation of funds could be prioritized
to achieve greater conservation and environmental benefits at the least Federal cost. Although not exclusive, such
considerations for prioritization may be based on temporary versus longer-term practices or type of conservation
or environmental benefit. Further, consideration should be given to whether priorities should be established by
the National, State, or county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices. Moreover, for ACP,
ECP and FIP, comments are requested on ways in which the programs can best be targeted in order to ensure that public
benefits, rather than private benefits are maximized with Federal expenditures. For example, the use of ACP for temporary
practices may not provide large public benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are requested as to whether funds should be targeted toward designated areas with impaired water quality.
Similarly, cost-share practices could be selected for a region where they will contribute to an identified problem.
Thus, nutrient management practices would be designated as a cost-share option in areas where nutrients have been
identified as a water quality problem.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The SCS State Conservationist may use the expertise from private consultants, State, or Federal agencies in performing
the assigned responsibilities if SCS certifies that assigned practices are completed properly. No responsibilities
will be assigned for counties when DASCO and the Chief, SCS, determine that it would not be administratively practicable
for the SCS to discharge such responsibilities. In such counties, these responsibilities shall be assumed by COC's.
The SCS may utilize resources of the State forestry agencies in performing assigned responsibilities for practices
involving the establishment of windbreaks or shelterbelts on farmland to prevent wind erosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The FS is responsible for the technical phases of practices or components of practices involving the planting
of trees for forestry purposes and those involving the improving or protecting of a stand of forest trees as specified
in State and county programs. The FS may use the assistance of private consultants, State, or Federal agencies in performing
these assigned responsibilities if FS certifies that assigned practices are completed properly; however, services
of State forestry agencies will be used to the extent that such services are available.

(a) Costs may be shared even though an adequate stand is not established, for practices involving the establishment
or improvement of vegetative cover, including trees, if the COC determines, according to standards approved by the
STC, that the practice was carried out in a manner which could normally result in the establishment of an adequate stand
and that failure to establish an adequate stand was due to weather or other conditions beyond the control of the participant.
The COC may require, as a condition of cost-share assistance in such cases, that the area be reseeded or replanted or
that other needed protective measures be performed. Cost-share assistance in such cases may also be approved for
repeat applications of measures previously performed or for additional eligible measures. Cost-share assistance
for such measures may be approved to the extent such measures are needed to ensure an adequate stand even though the
measures may be less than that required by the applicable practice wording for initial approvals.

though the minimum requirements for a practice are not satisfied, if the participant establishes to the satisfaction
of the COC and the county representative of any other agency having responsibility for technical phases of the practice
that a reasonable effort was made to satisfy the minimum requirements and that the practice as performed adequately
solves the need for the practice.

Each participant receiving cost-share assistance is responsible for the required maintenance and proper use of
the practice. Each practice shall have an established lifespan or minimum period of time that it is expected to function
as a conservation practice with proper maintenance. If ASCS determines that a practice has not been properly maintained
for the established lifespan, the participant receiving the cost-share assistance shall refund all or any part of
such cost-share assistance as determined appropriate by the ASC COC. Further, any agreement providing for cost-share
assistance will be terminated, with respect to the land on which the practice is located, if there is voluntary loss
of control of the land by the participant receiving the cost-share assistance and the person acquiring control of
such land elects not to become a successor in interest to the agreement. If the agreement providing for cost-share
assistance is terminated as a result of the voluntary loss of control of the land, each participant receiving cost-share
assistance under that agreement shall be liable for refunding to ASCS any cost-share assistance which has been received
with respect to the practice. In addition, such person shall forfeit any right to receive any further cost-share assistance
with respect to the land on which the practice is located.

(a) The objective of the ACP is to restore and protect the Nation's land and water resources. This objective will be
accomplished through a program that considers: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The need to control erosion and sedimentation from agricultural land and conserve the water resources on such
land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The need to control pollution from animal wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of 1977, and other congressional and administrative actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The degrees to which the measures contribute to the national objective of ensuring a continuous supply of food
and fiber necessary for the maintenance of a strong and healthy people and economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The type of conservation measures needed to improve water quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Selection of practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The practices to be included in the State or county ACP shall be only those practices authorized by Deputy Administrator
for which cost-share assistance is essential to permit accomplishment of the ACP objective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The maximum level of cost-share assistance for each practice shall be the percentage of the average cost of performing
the practice considered necessary to obtain the needed performance of the practice and established at a level such
that the participant will make a significant contribution to the cost of performing the practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Levels of cost-share assistance under annual agreements for each practice shall not be in excess of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seventy-five (75) percent of the average cost of performing the practice as determined by the COC. Where the Deputy
Administrator determines a higher level of cost-share assistance is necessary to provide adequate incentive for
a participant to perform a conservation practice, the Deputy Administrator may specifically authorize a higher
level. See &sect;701.116 for special provision for low-income farmers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Levels of cost-share assistance under long-term agreements shall not be in excess of seventy-five (75) percent
nor less than 50 percent of the average cost for each practice as determined by the COC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Method of approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The COC shall determine the extent to which Federal funds may be made available to share the cost of each approved
practice, taking into consideration the county allocation, the conservation and environmental problems in the
county, the land involved, and the practices for which requested cost-share assistance is considered by the COC as
most needed. The method approved shall provide for the issuance of notices of approval showing for each approved practice
the number of units of the practice for which the Federal Government will share in the cost and the amount of the cost-share
assistance for the performance of that number of units of the practice. To the extent practicable, notices of approved
practices shall be issued before performance of the practice is started. No practice may be approved for cost-share
assistance except as authorized by the county program, or according to procedures incorporated therein. Available
funds for cost-share assistance shall not be allocated on a proportionate share basis; however, cost-share funds
shall be directed to the accomplishment of the most enduring benefits attainable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Cost-share assistance may be approved under annual agreements or long-term agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Annual agreements may be approved in all counties. Long-term agreements are limited to farms or ranches which
are within Soil Conservation Districts (or comparable districts) through which the SCS provides planning and technical
services, except: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Farms and ranches located within a county designated for the Great Plains Conservation Program (GPCP) are only
eligible if not covered by GPCP contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Farms and ranches not located within a Soil Conservation District or comparable district may be eligible for a
long-term agreement provided CPO's are developed by the farmer or rancher in cooperation with the SCS and approved
by an appropriate State official or, in cases where an appropriate State official is not available, approved by the
SCS.

Long-term agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The period of a long-term agreement shall be for not less than three (3) program years nor more than ten (10) program
years. The COC and the signors to the long-term agreement in consultation with the SCS representative shall mutually
determine the period of the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The long-term agreement will be based on a CPO for the farm or ranch or portion thereof which has been approved by
the Soil Conservation District or comparable district or for farms or ranches not located in a Soil Conservation District
or comparable district, by an appropriate State Official or the SCS, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The long-term agreement will provide that the farmer or rancher will perform those measures in the CPO's which
are determined to be essential to meeting the basic conservation needs of the farm or ranch, or portion thereof, regardless
of whether cost-share assistance is approved for such measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The owner of the farm or ranch will be required to sign a long-term agreement regardless of whether that person contributes
to the cost of approved practices thereon except in cases where the long-term agreement consists wholly of integrated
crop management practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any party to a long-term agreement who is not an owner of the farm or ranch shall provide assurance of control of the
land for the duration of the period of the agreement.

(f) The level of cost-share assistance as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;701.110, in effect for practices in all years of a long-term agreement shall be the level in effect at the beginning
year of the agreement. The rate of cost-share assistance for payment purposes for such practice shall be based on the
average cost of performing the practice at the time the practice is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) A long-term agreement may be canceled for failure to fully comply with the terms of the agreement if, after consulting
with the Soil Conservation District or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS,
the State or COC determines that the seriousness of the irregularities warrant such action. If the agreement is canceled,
the parties to the agreement are jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit
all rights to further payments under the agreement. In such a case, no other refund or forfeiture provisions of these
regulations apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) A long-term agreement may be revised according to instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator by mutual agreement
between the parties to the agreement and the COC based on approved changes in the CPO's for the farm or ranch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An otherwise eligible person who acquires control of land under an approved agreement may elect to become a successor
in interest under such agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which loss of control has occurred and where the person
acquiring control of such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the agreement. If the loss of control
is for reasons beyond the control of the parties to the agreement, the COC will determine whether any cost-share assistance
previously paid shall be refunded; however, in no event shall the refund be greater than would be required in cases
where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of control is voluntary on the part of the signatories to the agreement,
the signatories will be jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all
rights to further payments, with respect to the land for which control is lost. However, a refund will not be required
for cost shares where the COC or the STC determine, after consulting with a representative of the SCS, that failure
to perform the remaining practices in the agreement will not impair the effectiveness of the practices which have
been performed and that the completed practices have provided conservation benefits consistent with the cost shares
which have been paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) An agreement may be terminated by the COC, after considering the recommendation of the Soil Conservation District
or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS if such action is in the public interest.
The COC will determine the amount of cost shares previously paid that shall be refunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) An agreement may be terminated by the COC upon the written request of the participant to a long-term agreement where
no cost-share assistance has been paid for any of the scheduled practices and where the participant does not intend
to perform any of the scheduled practices.

Program objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of the FIP is to help ensure a future supply of timber will be accomplished by encouraging landowners
to apply forestry practices for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Production of softwood and hardwood timber and other associated forest resources to increase afforestation
of suitable open lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Reforestation of cutover and understocked forest lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Timber stand improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Intensive multipurpose management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Protection of forest resources.

Designated counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The STC in consultation with the State Forester will designate the counties or parts of counties in which FIP will be
operated. The following will be considered in making the designations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The total acreage in the county devoted to desirable types of softwood and hardwood timber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The estimated area in the county that is under eligible ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The estimated acreage suitable for the production of forest products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The enhancement of other forest resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;701.302 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible person, land, and ownerships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An eligible person is a private individual, group, Native American Tribe or other native group, association,
corporation excluding corporations whose stocks are publicly traded, or other legal entity which owns eligible
land. Firms principally engaged in the manufacture of wood products are not eligible. However, forest landowners
who manufacture forest products on a part-time or irregular basis are eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Eligible land is nonindustrial private forest land capable of producing at least fifty (50) cubic feet of wood
per acre per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Eligible farms are those not exceeding a total of 1,000 acres of eligible private nonindustrial forest land in
the United States or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. The STC with the concurrence
of the State Forester may approve cost-share assistance with landowners owning more than 1,000 acres but not more
than 5,000 acres of eligible forest land where it is deemed to be to the public's significant benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Significant public benefits are primarily those resulting from cost-effective timber production with related
benefits to aesthetics, recreation, wildlife habitat, watershed protection, erosion reduction, and other resource
values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->

Program funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each designated State and county will receive a share of the funds provided for the program. Funds will be distributed
on the basis of the forest production opportunities in each State, considering the acreage of private nonindustrial
forest lands, the number of eligible owners, the potential productivity of such lands and the need for reforestation,
timber stand improvement, other forestry management needs, and the enhancement of other forest resources. The Deputy
Administrator will allocate funds after consultation with representatives of the FS and a committee of not less than
five State foresters or equivalent State officials selected by a majority of the State foresters or equivalent State
officials. The STC will consult with the State forester when determining the allocation of such funds to the designated
counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A limitation on the amount of funds which may be obligated under long-term agreements shall be established by the
STC according to guidelines provided by the Deputy Administrator.

Eligible practices and cost-share assistance requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) Cost-share assistance may be available for the following National practices and authority: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Planting Trees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Improving a Stand of Forest Trees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Special Forestry Practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Deputy Administrator after consultation with the FS, may approve special forestry practices needed to solve
a significant and unique local condition for which the National practices are not adequate. Such practices may be
approved for inclusion in a county program after consultation with the program development group and the recommendation
of the COC, the service forester, the STC, and the State forester. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A forest management plan is required as a condition for cost-share assistance. The Forest Management plan will
be developed in consultation with the landowner, approved by the service forester, and will contain information
for accurate evaluation of practice effectiveness. The participant will be required to perform those measures in
the Forest Management plan which are essential to the effectiveness of the practice for which costs are shared. In
the development of the Forest Management plan, consideration will be given to wildlife, watershed protection, recreation,
erosion control, aesthetics, and other associated forest resources values as well as cost-effective timber production.

practice considered necessary by ASCS to ensure completion of the practice by the participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Levels of cost-share assistance shall be approved by the STC and shall not be in excess of sixty-five (65) percent
of actual costs incurred by the landowners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For the purpose of establishing rates of cost-share assistance, the average cost of performing a practice may
be the average cost for a State, a county or a part of a county, as determined by the STC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The rates of cost-share assistance for practices included in the county FIP may be lower than the rates approved
for general use in the State, as determined by the COC.

Prior approval for cost-share assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs will be shared only for those practices, or components of practices, for which cost-share assistance is requested
and approval issued before performance is started.

Methods of approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The COC shall determine the extent to which Federal funds may be made available to share the cost of each approved practice.
Approvals shall be made based on consideration of the county allocation, cost-effective opportunities for increasing
timber production, potential for enhancing other forest resources, the forestry needs in the county, and the practices
for which requested cost-share assistance is considered by the COC as most needed. The method approved shall provide
for the issuance of notices of approval showing for each approved practice the number of units of the practice for which
the Federal Government will share in the cost and the amount of the cost share for the performance of that number of units
of the practice. Notices of approved requests shall be issued before the practice may be started. No practice may be
approved for cost-share assistance except as authorized by the county FIP. Available funds for cost-share assistance
shall not be allocated on a pro-rata basis, but shall be directed to the accomplishment of the most production attainable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Cost-share assistance may be approved under annual agreements or long-term agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Land covered by a GPCP contract is not excluded from an annual or long-term agreement if the land is otherwise eligible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The same practices, cost-share levels, and general program provisions apply to both annual agreements and long-term
agreements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Long-term agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The period of a long-term agreement shall be for not less than three (3) years nor more than ten (10) years. The COC
and the parties to the agreement in consultation with the State forestry representative will mutually determine
the scheduling of essential practices and practice cost-sharing over the period of the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The long-term agreement shall be based on a forest management plan for the land which shall be developed by the service
forester. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The long-term agreement shall provide that the owner shall perform those measures in the forest management plan
which are determined to be essential regardless of whether cost-share assistance is approved for such measures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The level of cost-share assistance in effect for practices in all years of a long-term agreement shall be the level
in effect for the beginning year of the agreement. The rate of cost-sharing for payment purposes for such practices
will be based on the average cost of performing the practice at the time the practice is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A long-term agreement may be canceled for failure to fully comply with the terms of the agreement if, after consulting
with the service forester, the STC or COC determines that the seriousness of the irregularities warrant such action.
If the agreement is canceled, the signors to the agreement are jointly and severally responsible for refunding all
cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further payments under the agreement. In such a case, no other refund
or forfeiture provisions of these regulations apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A long-term agreement may be revised in accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator where
there is a change in status of the participants or the land under agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) An eligible person who acquires control of land under an approved agreement may elect to become a successor in interest
under such agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which loss of control has occurred and where the person
acquiring control of such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the agreement. If the loss of control
is for reasons beyond the control of the signatories to the agreement, the COC will determine whether or not any cost-share
assistance previously paid shall be refunded; however, in no event shall the refund be greater than would be required
in cases where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of control is voluntary on the part of the signatories, they
will be jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further
payments, with respect to the land for which control is lost. A refund will not be required for cost-share assistance
where the COC or the STC determines, after consulting with the service forester, that failure to perform the remaining
practices in the agreement will not impair the effectiveness of the practices which have been performed and that the
completed practices will provide forestry benefits consistent with the cost-share assistance which have been paid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An agreement may be terminated if, after considering the recommendation of the service forester, the STC or COC
recommends that such action is in the public interest.

(a) Cost-share assistance may be authorized under FIP for the establishment or installation of the practices contained
in this part. Cost-share assistance may not be authorized for repeating any of the practices in this part with the same
owner on the same acreage, except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Cost-share assistance may be authorized for the replacement, enlargement, or restoration of practices for which
such assistance has been allowed under the program only if all of the following conditions exist: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Replacement or restoration of the practice is needed to solve a conservation or environmental problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The failure of the original practice was not due to the lack of proper maintenance by the current operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The COC believes that the replacement or restoration of the practice merits consideration under the program to
an equal extent with other practices cost-shared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Cost-share assistance may be authorized for timber stand improvement measures carried out in repetitive steps
where the stand treatment warrants such silvicultural practice in the judgment of the service forester.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document invites written comments on a proposal that would suspend for nearly two years certain provisions of
the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Federal milk orders. If adopted,
the proposal would regulate a plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, under the Tennessee Valley order, instead of the Carolina
order, and it would keep regulated under the Tennessee Valley order a plant at Somerset, Kentucky, that otherwise
might become regulated under the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order. The proposals were submitted by Land-O-Sun
Dairies, which operates the Kingsport, Tennessee, plant, and Southern Bell Dairy, Inc., which operates the Somerset,
Kentucky, plant. These handlers contend that without the suspension they would be subject to pricing disparities
that could jeopardize their business.

Notice of Proposed Suspension (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29): Issued October 22, 1993; published October 28, 1993 (58 FR
57970). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action
would lessen the regulatory burden on small entities by removing pricing disparities that are causing or could cause
financial hardship for certain distributing plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not
intended to have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the
order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling.

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 57970) on October 28, 1993, concerning the proposed suspension of certain provisions of the Georgia, Carolina,
and Tennessee Valley Federal milk orders (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29). The public was afforded the opportunity to comment
on the notice by submitting written data, views, and arguments by November 4, 1993. Six comment letters were received
concerning the three-market proposed suspension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the issuance of the above proposed suspension, a suspension request was received from a handler regulated
under the Tennessee Valley order that in effect expands the initial suspension issue to the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
order. It also affects a proposed suspension that was issued earlier for the Louisville order. Because of the interrelationship
of these several requests, it has been determined that a revised proposed suspension involving all four orders should
be issued for comment. Therefore, notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), the suspension of the following provisions of the orders
regulating the handling of milk in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
marketing areas is being considered for a 23-month period beginning February 1, 1994:

Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed suspension would allow a distributing plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, that is located within the Tennessee
Valley marketing area and that meets all of the pooling standards of the Tennessee Valley order to be regulated under
that order rather than the Carolina order, as now, despite the plant having greater sales in the Carolina marketing
area. It would also allow a distributing plant located at Somerset, Kentucky, that has been regulated under the Tennessee
Valley order to remain regulated there even if it should develop greater sales in the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
(Order 46) marketing area. In addition, the proposed suspension would allow a supply plant at Springfield, Kentucky,
that has been supplying the Somerset plant to remain pooled under the Tennessee Valley order without having to make
uneconomic shipments of milk that it contends would be necessary if the Southern Belle plant shifted to Order 46. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. The problem of Land-O-Sun Dairies, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent months, the blend price to producers at Kingsport, Tennessee, under the Tennessee Valley order has been
significantly higher than the blend price at that location under the Carolina order. For example, during the months
of July through October 1993, the Tennessee Valley blend price at Kingsport was 32 cents, 29 cents, 20 cents, and 20
cents, respectively, higher than the Carolina blend price at Kingsport. Although the Class I price at Kingsport is
identical under both of these orders, the Tennessee Valley order's higher Class I utilization has resulted in a higher
blend price at Kingsport during nearly every month for the past two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference in blend prices at Kingsport requires Land-O-Sun Dairies, as a Carolina order handler, to pay significant
over-order prices to retain its milk supply in competition with nearby handlers regulated under the Tennessee Valley
order. Land-O-Sun has indicated that it cannot continue to pay these over-order prices without jeopardizing the
existence of its business. It therefore proposed a suspension of certain provisions of Orders 5 and 11 that would allow
it to become regulated under Order 11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the earlier proposed suspension, the paragraph that is proposed to be suspended from the Georgia order
is merely a conforming change to preserve the status quo between the Carolina and Georgia orders. This change is necessary
to continue the regulation of a Greenville, South Carolina, plant under the Georgia order. Without the suspension,
the plant would become regulated under the Carolina order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. The problem of Southern Belle Dairy Company. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern Belle Dairy at Somerset, Kentucky, has been regulated under Order 11 for the past four years. However, recently
it has acquired accounts that could cause it to shift to Order 46. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent months, the blend price at Somerset under Order 11 has been significantly higher than the blend price at that
location under Order 46. For example, during the months of July through October 1993, the blend price under Order 11
at Somerset was 67 cents, 62 cents, 49 cents, and 25 cents, respectively, higher than the Order 46 price at that location.
Of these amounts, 19 cents is attributable to a 19-cent higher Class I price at that location under Order 11. Southern
Belle contends that if it should shift to Order 46 it would have to pay substantial over-order prices to its producers
to retain its milk supply. Moreover, slight changes in sales could cause it to shift back and forth between the two orders,
causing market instability and uncertainty under the base-excess programs applicable to both orders.

3. The problem of Armour Food Ingredients Company. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Armour Food operates a supply plant and a nonpool manufacturing plant at Springfield, Kentucky. The supply plant
has been regulated under Order 11 since August 1992. If the Southern Belle plant shifts to Order 46, Armour's supply
plant would also become subject to the regulations of Order 46 because the plant is supplying milk to the Southern Belle
plant. Armour contends that the plant would not qualify as a pool plant based on its present milk handling practices
because, under the net shipment provision of Order 46, all of the shipments sent to its manufacturing facility from
pool distributing plants for surplus disposal would be subtracted from its shipments to pool distributing plants.
Armour states that to keep the milk of its producers pooled under Order 46 it would have to incur substantial increases
in transportation and assembly costs. To avoid these costs, Armour proposed suspending language in the net shipment
provision of Order 46.

4. Industry responses to the earlier proposed suspensions (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29 and DA&hyph;93&hyph;26). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the Land-O-Sun request, a notice of proposed suspension of provisions in Orders 5, 7, and 11 was issued
on October 22, 1993 (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29)(58 FR 57970). Four comments were submitted in support of the action, and
two comments were filed in opposition to it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Milkco, Inc., a handler regulated under the Carolina order with a plant in Asheville, North Carolina, stated that
it supported the proposed suspension. Southern Belle Dairy also submitted a letter in support of the suspension.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A letter supporting the suspension also was received from Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., on behalf of Southern Milk
Sales, Inc., a dairy cooperative with producer milk pooled on the Tennessee Valley, Georgia, and Carolina orders.
The cooperative notes in its letter that ``paying higher over-order values to maintain its supply of milk would jeopardize
the existence of the affected distributing plant.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, an individual dairy farmer who supplies producer milk to Land-O-Sun filed a comment in support of the
suspension. He stated that if Land-O-Sun paid him a lesser price for his milk he would have to sell to another handler.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coburg Dairy, a Carolina order handler located in Charleston, South Carolina, filed a comment opposing the suspension.
Coburg competes with the Kingsport plant for Class I sales in the Carolina market. The handler argued that the regulation
of the Kingsport plant under the Tennessee Valley order would give the plant a competitive advantage in the Carolina
market since it has a lower Class I price and because it presumably would not have to pay over-order prices to its producers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation, a general farm organization, also objected to the proposed suspension
on the grounds that regulation of the Kingsport plant under Order 11 would jeopardize the over-order prices in the
Carolina market. The Federation indicated that eroding Class I premiums and lower Class I utilization were threatening
the health of the dairy industry in North Carolina. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Armour Food request, a notice of proposed suspension of the net shipment provision of Order 46 was
issued on September 22, 1993 (DA&hyph;93&hyph;26) (58 FR 50526). Three comments were submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern Belle supported the suspension, indicating that Armour was supplying it with milk and could encounter problems
of assembly and transportation if the plant became subject to the provisions of Order 46 because of a shift in regulation
of the Southern Belle plant from Order 11 to Order 46. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Milk Marketing, Inc., a cooperative association with 688 dairy farmers under Order 46, and The Kroger Company, a handler
operating Winchester Farms Dairy at Winchester, Kentucky, filed comments opposing the proposed suspension of the
net shipment provision. MMI argued that if the net shipment provision is suspended, the intent of the order would not
be carried out appropriately and that the needs of the order would not be met in an efficient manner. Kroger stated that
there was not an abundant amount of milk available for fluid use under Order 46 and that the net shipment provision was
needed to help assure that distributing plants have sufficient supplies of milk to meet their fluid requirements.
It contends that there is no justification to relax the performance provisions of the order during the season when
milk availability is reduced and Class I sales increase simply because there is a ``possibility'' that a distributing
plant may switch regulation from Order 11 to Order 46. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No final action has been taken on Armour's request to suspend the net shipment provision. However, since that issue
would become moot under the proposed suspension being considered herein, final action on the Armour proposal is being
held in abeyance pending the outcome of the current proposal.

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend, for 23 months, the 45 percent delivery requirement
for a plant operated by a cooperative association that is located within the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area.
The suspension was requested by Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood,
Louisiana. The association states that without the suspension, it will be forced to make inefficient qualifying
shipments of milk merely to keep the milk of its producers qualified for pooling under the order.

(5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action would not

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would suspend for the months of February 1994 through December 1995 the 45 percent delivery requirement
for a cooperative association plant that is located in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana, that is regulated under
Order 94 submitted the suspension request. The cooperative stated that because of the present 45 percent delivery
requirement applicable to a cooperative association that wishes to qualify a manufacturing plant for pooling, it
has had to shift some of its producers to neighboring Greater Louisiana (Order 96) pool plants to keep its Kentwood
plant qualified as a pool plant under Order 94. It indicated that Order 96 requires that six days' production of a producer
must be received at pool plants each month in order to qualify the milk for pooling by diversion to a nonpool plant. Accordingly,
it has had to move the milk of selected producers to Order 96 pool plants six days per month. Since this milk is not actually
needed by these pool plants, the cooperative has then had to back-haul the milk to its Kentwood manufacturing plant
for processing. The problem is now particularly acute, according to the cooperative, because two Order 94 pool plants
have notified Gulf Dairy Association that they will no longer purchase milk from them after February 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf Dairy Association noted that the problem it is experiencing will be resolved through the proposed merger of milk
orders that is now under consideration by the Department. It urged that the proposed suspension be effective pending
the completion of that proceeding.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to adjust the current Examinations Fee schedule for the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) in order to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs of providing immigration and naturalization services,
and to change procedures and charges for the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, Form I&hyph;129, in response to INS
and user experiences. The fee adjustment is needed to comply with specific Federal immigration laws and the Federal
user fee statute and regulations, which require the recipients of special benefits from Government services that
are not directed to the public at large to bear the costs to the Government of providing those services. The fees proposed
in this rule result from an analysis of adjudication and naturalization services and associated costs for fiscal
years 1993 and 1994, and are calculated to recover the costs of providing these special services and benefits. This
proposed rule ensures that funds will be available to continue to improve the quality of service to users. Its financial
impact on users of the services is small. In most cases the proposed fee increase is five dollars. In the aggregate this
proposed fee increase is slightly less than the projected change in the consumer price index since the last general
fee increase in April 1991.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is required by law to charge fees
to the users of its services. Such fees presently comprise about 36 percent of the INS budget. There are four fee accounts,
and the fees which are collected in each account are used to fund specific services. The four fee accounts are the Immigration
Examinations Fee Account, the Immigration User Fee Account, the Land Border Inspection Fee Account, and the Legalization
Fee Account. Because the fees in each of these accounts are designed to recover the costs which are incurred to provide
specific services, they must be reviewed regularly and adjusted as costs change or more precise cost determination
processes become available. This rule proposes to modify the examinations fee schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Immigration Examinations Fee Account (Examinations Fee Account) provides funds for immigration adjudication
and naturalization services. It is funded by a total of 32 separate fees for processing the various applications used
by INS. Examples include applications for permanent resident status, petitions for relatives, employment authorization
applications, reentry permits, and extensions of temporary stay. The separate fees currently range from $30 to $140.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To cover the costs of providing adjudication and naturalization services, it has been determined that a fee increase
of 7.5 percent is needed. This increase reflects inflation since the last general fee increase in April 1991, the assignment
of certain additional costs to the Examinations Fee Account for services that support adjudications and naturalization
functions, and the costs of investments to improve services to users. This proposed rule would adjust the current
fee schedule by 7.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Refining the Fee Development Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
INS has initiated a process of continuous improvement in the management of the finances of the fee accounts and the
development of fee schedules. Areas that are being addressed over a projected multi-year time horizon include: Identifying
the INS resources consumed in providing services to our customers which by law must be recovered through fee revenues;
refining definitions of direct and indirect costs; and refining cost measurement systems, in concert with wider
Department of Justice initiatives to improve financial management information systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of necessity, to ensure the availability of necessary funds for maintaining operations, the first phase of this effort
has been identification of INS resource use that must be recovered through fees. Prior to 1992, INS had not analyzed
rigorously the full extent of its costs related to fee-supported services. In 1992, INS undertook a comprehensive
review of the work that should properly be charged to fee accounts in order to meet statutory requirements. Extensive
information gathering and analysis were performed as part of this effort. The aggregate cost of the work in support
of the Examinations Fee Account was computed based on the budget for fiscal year 1993 and the estimated budget for fiscal
year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information was used to compute the percentage revenue increase required to cover the costs, and that percentage,
with limited exceptions, was applied to the existing fee schedule that has been in place since 1991 to arrive at the
proposed fees, through the steps explained in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead of using the existing fee schedule as a base for the percentage increases, INS also considered whether it would
have been feasible to base the proposed fees on 1992 cost measurements. INS rejected this approach because of problems
with 1992 data caused by the transition to a more automated system of productivity measurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Future fee adjustments will reflect efforts to refine direct and indirect cost definitions and measurements, and
will address alternative approaches to the allocation of indirect costs among applicants for services. At this time,
however, the current fee schedule, with the adjustments specifically identified below, reflects the best available
comprehensive data on service costs, and was therefore judged to be the soundest foundation for computing the proposed
fee schedules for fiscal year 1994.

II. Directives and Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
INS's examinations fees have been designed in accordance with legislation, guidance from the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) and the Department, and accepted principles of ratemaking in regulated public and commercial enterprises.
The overall principle employed is one of cost causation, which means the fees are designed to cover the costs associated
with providing the services funded through the Examinations Fee Account.

A. Legislation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The enabling legislation for the Examinations Fee Account is the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the
Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1989 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;459), a U.S.C. 1356(n), which provides
that the receipts collected shall ``*&blank;*&blank;* remain available *&blank;*&blank;* to reimburse any appropriation
the amount paid out of such appropriation for expenses in providing immigration adjudication and naturalization
services and the collection, safeguarding and accounting for fees *&blank;*&blank;*''. The Departments of Commerce,
Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;515), 8 U.S.C.
1356(m), provides further ``*&blank;*&blank;* that fees for providing adjudication and naturalization services
may be set at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing all such services, including the costs
of similar services provided without charge to asylum applicants or other immigrants. Such fees may also be set at
a level that will recover any additional costs associated with the administration of the fees collected.'' The general
authority to assess fees for services is found in the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1952 (Pub. L. 82&hyph;137)
(IOAA), 31 U.S.C. 9701, frequently referred to as the ``user fee statute,'' which provides for Federal agencies to
define special services provided to unique segments of the population and to charge fees for those services instead
of supporting them through general tax revenues. The IOAA provides that ``*&blank;*&blank;* each service or thing
of value provided by an agency *&blank;*&blank;* to a person *&blank;*&blank;* is to be self-sustaining to the extent
possible.'' These charges, among other things, are to be based on ``*&blank;*&blank;* [t]he costs to the Government
*&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1986, proposed fee increases for adjudication services were challenged in the Federal District Court for the District
of Columbia on the grounds that the Attorney General lacked authority to impose fees for the services in question and
that, even if the fees were legally permissible, the specific fees under challenge were arbitrarily excessive. In

Accordingly, it appearing that the service fees were established through appropriate administrative procedures
after adequate cost analysis and with opportunity for public participation, and that they are in all respects consistent
with the statutes being implemented, summary judgment must be granted to the Attorney General and denied to plaintiffs.

In light of settled law, we are constrained to conclude that the INS fees at issue are for a ``service or thing of value''
which provides the recipients with a special benefit *&blank;*&blank;*. Since these procedures are triggered only
at the instance of the individual who seeks, obviously, to benefit from them, this fee regime cannot in fairness be
characterized as an INS effort to charge for activities that are carried on principally to benefit the public generally.
The benefit is simply too direct and immediate to a specific, identifiable beneficiary to consider such services
as constituting primarily a broad part of INS' overall mission to serve the public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB circular A&hyph;25, User Charges, states that as a general policy ``a user charge *&blank;*&blank;* will be assessed
against each identifiable recipient for special benefits derived from Federal activities beyond those received
by the general public.'' The following discussion is provided:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When a service (or privilege) provides special benefits to an identifiable recipient beyond those that accrue to
the general public, a charge will be imposed (to recover the full cost to the Federal Government for providing the special
benefit, or the market price). For example, a special benefit will be considered to accrue and a user charge will be
imposed when a Government service:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may not be measurable
in monetary terms) than those that accrue to the general public (e.g., receiving a patent, insurance, or guarantee
provision, or a license to carry on a specific activity or business or various kinds of public land use); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Provides business stability or contributes to public confidence in the business activity of the beneficiary
(e.g., insuring deposits in commercial banks); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Is performed at the request of or for the convenience of the recipient, and is beyond the services regularly received
by other members of the same industry or group or by the general public (e.g., receiving a passport, visa, airman's
certificate, or a Custom's inspection after regular duty hours).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Justice issued guidance on User Fee Programs in April 1993. The guidance states that as a general
policy ``a charge shall be imposed to recover the full cost to the Federal Government of rendering a service that provides
specific benefits to an identifiable recipient above and beyond those that accrue to the public at large.'' The following
discussion is provided:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Cost is a financial measurement of resources used in accomplishing a specified purpose, carrying out an activity,
or completing a unit of work or a specific project *&blank;*&blank;*. Direct costs are those which are proximate and
directly traceable to the unit of output for which the fee is charged. Indirect costs are those which are more distant,
general in nature, and not directly traceable to the product or service produced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* [E]xisting legislation may require the inclusion of costs for selected activities not directly
related to the unit of performance or product for which a fee is charged. Where this occurs, both the direct and indirect
costs of such activities should be included in the cost computation.

D. Ratemaking Principles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above-stated policies, as set forth by statute and more fully developed by OMB and the Department, comport with
reasonable standards for user charges and are strongly supported by the prescriptions of economic experts with widely
recognized credentials in the field of ratemaking policy. Any other approach would burden taxpayers with costs that
can be traced directly to the needs of specific individuals, not to society at large.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of many similar statements on cost of service as a basic standard of reasonableness is stated as follows in the authoritative
text by Bonbright, Danielsen, and Kamerschen:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No writer whose views on public utility rates command respect purports to find a single yardstick by sole reference
to which rates may be judged reasonable or socially desirable as distinguished from rates that are unreasonable or
adverse to the public interest. A complex of tests of acceptability is required just as would be the case with the tests
of a good automobile, a good income-tax law, or a good poem. Nevertheless, one standard of reasonable rates can fairly
be said to outrank all others in the importance attached to it by experts and public opinion alike_the standard of costs
of service, often qualified by the stipulation that the relevant cost is necessary, true (i.e., private and social)
cost or cost reasonably or prudently incurred.*&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A cost standard of ratemaking has been most generally accepted in the regulation of the levels of rates charged by private
utility companies. But even more significant is the widespread adherence to cost, or to some approximation of cost,
as a basis of ratemaking under public ownership*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This section describes the major programs funded by the Examinations Fee Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Adjudications and Naturalization Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The function of this program is to process, adjudicate, and ultimately grant or deny applications and petitions for
benefits provided under the immigration laws of the United States. Adjudications activities include processing
applications for permanent resident status, petitions for relatives, temporary and permanent worker petitions,
reentry permits, refugee travel documents, extensions of temporary stay, employment authorizations, and temporary
protected status. Naturalization activities include the examination of aliens to determine their qualifications
for naturalization, administration of the oath for citizenship, and issuance of citizenship documents.

B. Refugees and Overseas Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The function of this program is to adjudicate refugee and asylum applications, conduct investigations for preference
and relative visa petitions, and conduct other records checks and background investigations as are required at overseas
INS offices. Officers assigned to this program also provide assistance to citizens and lawful permanent residents
abroad regarding adoptions, immigration, or parole of alien spouses and children, and other benefits under the Immigration
and Nationality Act. They also review requests for the Attorney General to grant humanitarian parole into the United
States for deserving persons.

C. Information and Records Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Information and Records Management program provides a variety of services critical to the adjudications and
naturalization processes. These services include: Creating, updating, storing, retrieving, and tracking alien
files; responding to inquiries on application status; providing information to the public, both in-person and by
telephone, on immigration-related matters; printing and distributing application forms and instructions and
providing them to the public.

D. Data and Communications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Data and Communications program develops and operates INS automated information systems which support the adjudications
and naturalization program, and operates the identification card production facility. Adjudications and naturalization
support systems are currently being integrated and consolidated into the Computer Linked Application Information
Management System (CLAIMS), which provides adjudication support to service centers, district offices, and ports
of entry. The system, which is operating in the service centers and is being installed in other field offices, reduces
application processing time and response time to inquiries.

IV. Fee Setting Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides a description of INS fee-setting procedures, including an explanation of the cost bases for
setting fees. Descriptions of the examinations fees and their cost components and an explanation of the procedures
employed by INS to calculate the costs are included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. History of Current Examinations Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Policies pertaining to the assessment of INS user fees and their underlying costs have evolved over 25 years, beginning
in 1968. The Examinations Fee Account itself has a more recent history, starting in 1989. Prior to 1989, all examinations
fee revenues were treated as general revenues of the Federal Government. They are now credited to the Examinations
Fee Account and used to fund related services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures to compute examinations fees involve the development and summation of three cost components: direct
costs, indirect costs, and a surcharge to recover the costs of the Refugees and Overseas program. These three cost
components are described more fully below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salient developments preceding the analyses that led to this proposed rule include the issuance in December 1992
of an audit report prepared by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Justice. That report,
entitled ``Controls Over Established User Fee Accounts in the Immigration and Naturalization Service'' (DOJ OIG
Audit Report No. 93&hyph;3), stated that INS's accounting system did not identify properly all costs that ought to
be recovered from user fee accounts. This view is summarized below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The review of actual program costs disclosed that all identified costs were charged to the proper user fee accounts.
However, the INS accounting system does not provide usable cost data applicable to the user fee program and INS program
managers had not identified all the direct program costs that should have been reimbursed from the user fee accounts.
In addition, various INS units providing indirect support of personnel and services were not receiving user fee reimbursement
commensurate with the level of resources expended *&blank;*&blank;* Since valid direct and indirect program costs
went unidentified, appropriated funds essentially subsidized user fee related program costs that should have been
reimbursed from user fee revenue.

DOJ OIG Audit Report No. 93&hyph;3, at p. i.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The finding that all program costs were not being recovered from user fee accounts triggered several actions by INS
that culminated in the current proposed rule. At the same time that the OIG was conducting its audit, a senior Justice
Department official reviewed the fee-setting process and proposed changes. As a result, the OIG deferred additional
work in this area. According to the audit report:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A plan was developed and approved and the same Justice official was detailed to compile user fee costs, revise fee schedules
as necessary to collect revenues sufficient to make each account self-sustaining, and obtain Congressional approval
to reprogram INS appropriations accordingly. This project was initiated in March 1992 and is scheduled to be completed
by the end of FY 1992. Since the project covered most of the problem areas disclosed by our audit, we deferred additional
audit work in this area.

DOJ OIG Audit Report No. 93&hyph;3, at p. ii.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The review of the process conducted during 1992 consisted of a detailed survey and extensive consultations with all
INS program offices to review the extent to which they provide services to fee account activities, whether they were
commensurately reimbursed for those services, and whether specific service improvement investments would be appropriate
if additional fee account revenues were available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An initial reallocation (reprogramming) of program costs proposed earlier by the Attorney General was approved
by Congress, with the effect of properly assigning some costs of user fee activities to the fee accounts. The budget
enacted by Congress for fiscal year 1993 reflected these reallocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 review found that the Attorney General's reprogramming had substantially corrected the assignment of costs
identifiable at that point as related to fee account activities, with two exceptions: The costs of legal proceedings
and the costs of management and administration. In the case of these two programs, some costs are being charged to fee
accounts, but not enough to cover the substantial work associated with the fee account activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review also concluded that although a number of investments were recommended by review participants, the recommendations
generally anticipated actions that were planned in future budget cycles. Therefore the investments would generally
be addressed as part of INS's normal budget review process, rather than as a part of the current fee adjustment process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed fee increase incorporates the results of this extensive review of INS programs, inflationary cost
increases since the last general fee increase in April 1991, and the projected costs of presently budgeted program
investments to improve services to INS's customers.

B. Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Cost Components
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB Circular A&hyph;25, in its discussion of cost determination for purposes of setting fees, provides that ``user
charges will be sufficient to recover the full cost to the Federal Government *&blank;*&blank;* of providing the
service *&blank;*&blank;*.'' It also provides that those costs shall include an ``appropriate share of the management
and supervisory costs.'' Circular No. A&hyph;25, User Charges, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management
and Budget, July 8, 1993, pp. 3&hyph;5. Direct costs are only the most readily identifiable costs of providing user
services. Each service also has indirect components which, although not as easily identifiable, are nevertheless
causally related to the costs of providing services. Each examinations fee has three components: direct costs, indirect
costs, and a surcharge to cover the costs of the Refugees and Overseas Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Direct costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Direct costs are those costs directly related to the processing of a particular application form for a particular
benefit. Direct costs include: the pay of the Adjudications officers and clerical staff working on each type of application
and the costs of their associated personnel benefits; the costs of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) name and
fingerprint checks; where applicable, the costs by application of naturalization ceremonies conducted by United
States Courts; and the costs of INS immigration document and card production. The pay costs are calculated by multiplying
average adjudications processing time by the hourly pay for the average grade levels of adjudicators and clerks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Indirect costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indirect costs reflected in the current fee structure are defined as the costs of supervisory, management, and administrative
activities, related staff training, records, data processing, and files services, legal services, and space and
support costs of providing immigration benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act and related statutes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indirect costs also include costs in the management and administration portion of the INS budget, such as the costs
of the personnel administration work needed to recruit and pay the officers and clerks who process customers' applications
for benefits. The activities associated with these costs are no less essential to providing INS services to its customers
than are the direct costs. These indirect costs are distinguished only by the somewhat greater complexity of determining
the portion of such costs that are attributable to work done for fee-paying customers. In addition, indirect costs
include the cost of auditing the Examinations Fee Account by the Department of Justice Inspector General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Surcharge. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs to carry out the Refugees and Overseas Program are borne by the Examinations Fee Account, at the direction
of Congress. See section 286(m) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1356(m). These costs are treated as a surcharge that is added to
the examinations fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Cost Transfers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A transfer is the shift of costs from one account to another. Transfers arise when costs from one account are identified
as appropriately charged to another account. Transfers have been prompted by cost reviews such as that conducted
in 1992 to refine the identification of costs attributable to user fee activities. Transfers found in the 1992 review
to be necessary to meet statutory requirements are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A review of INS workload statistics identified the equivalent of 78 additional positions and work years of legal activities
that properly should be charged to Examinations Fee Account activities. These legal activities include appearances
before the Immigration Court for hearings related to asylum, adjustment of status, registry, waivers of inadmissibility,
and rescission; the preparation of arguments and briefs for such hearings; appearances before Federal and state
courts for contested naturalization hearings; appearances in U.S. District Courts in mandamus and declaratory
judgment cases; preparation of arguments, briefs, and litigation reports in such cases; and associated legal consultations
and preparation of legal memoranda. Also included are resources for support staff, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney,
Regional Counsel, and District Counsel positions chargeable for Examinations work. INS will propose to transfer
these 78 positions, work years, and associated costs from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to the Examinations
Fee Account. Copies of this review are available upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management and administration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Management and Administration (M&amp;A) resources have been assigned to the Examinations Fee Account using a ``distribution-key''
concept. Distribution-key is a term borrowed from the U.S. Postal Service's cost allocation practice. With this
practice, costs which cannot be directly related to a certain class or account are distributed on the basis of costs
which can be directly assigned. For example, in the case of mail processing, the costs associated with supervision
of mail clerks (where no direct statistical assignment mechanisms are in place) are distributed on the same basis
as are the costs for the mail clerks themselves (where statistical workload measurement systems are in place). See,
for example, Postal Rate Commission, Docket No. R90&hyph;1, United States Postal Service Library Reference F&hyph;1,
Summary Description of USPS Cost Development by Segments and Components, fiscal year 1988, pp. 2&hyph;2 through
2&hyph;5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this process, a full-time equivalent work year (referred to as ``work year'' or ``FTE'') was chosen as the distribution-key.
Costs were allocated based upon the percentage distribution of work years between the Examinations Fee Account and
all other accounts in INS. See Exhibit 1, Derivation of Management and Administration Distribution Key.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At INS, examinations officer work years relate directly to workload volume, and the management and administration
work that supports the examinations officers are dependent upon the number of officer work years. Work years are a
useful gauge of the resources needed in each program because they include the contributions of both full and part-time
staff. Other possible distribution-keys (positions and dollars) are believed to be inferior to work years. Positions
alone are inferior as a distribution-key because they include only full-time permanent staff and vacancies. The
use of positions would understate proper assignment levels to the extent that part-time workers are ignored, but
would overstate proper assignment levels to the extent that vacancies are included. Dollars are also an inferior
distribution-key because they may be skewed by the inclusion of one-time expenditures or other unique costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distribution-key concept is consistent with the guidance provided by the Department. The following discussion
is provided:

For each overhead activity *&blank;*&blank;*, estimate, on a rational basis, approximately what percentage of
the amount is indirectly relatable or incidental to the functions and costs *&blank;*&blank;* . The percentage assigned
ordinarily should be based on the relative amount of time or outputs traceable to the particular unit of performance.
In the case of very general, non-traceable activities (e.g., executive direction or congressional and public affairs),
where there are labor-intensive performance units, general or non-traceable cost allocations may be predicated
on relative employment (costs or full time personnel equivalents) devoted directly to the fee account revenue-generating
programs vis-a-vis all other programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To distribute costs properly, based on the distribution-key concept, INS will propose to transfer 143 positions,
133 work years, and associated costs from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to the Examinations Fee Account.
However, INS will not propose to use all of the resources potentially available as a result of the transfer to correct
documented deficiencies in M&amp;A program support activities in fiscal year 1994. Rather, INS will propose to use
part of these resources to support additional work years for the Adjudications and Naturalization Program to ensure
good service during the period of transition when more work will be shifted from district offices to service centers
(the ``Direct Mail III'' program). INS will defer full use of the resources for program support activities until fiscal
year 1995 or 1996, as conditions warrant.

3. Investments to Improve Service Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Service quality improvements are made possible by investments in staff additions and capital assets. One investment
which will be financed by the examinations fee increase will be the continued expansion of INS service center operations.
These expanded automation-intensive facilities will improve productivity and reduce delays in application processing
operations. The transfer of work now conducted at the district offices to the service centers will improve processing
at district offices and allow district office staff to devote more time to those applications which require personal
contact with people applying for benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Proposed Fee Increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for increased revenues which underlies the proposed fee increase was calculated by adjusting the projected
total costs of providing adjudications and naturalization services to include the transfers and service improvements
described above, and comparing the costs to the revenue projected under the current fee schedule. Because they are
reflected in INS budget projections, the calculation incorporates the effects of inflation-based cost increases
that have occurred since the last general fee increase in April 1991 and all other mandatory adjustments to the cost
base. This calculation yields a required percentage revenue increase which, with limited exceptions, was then uniformly
applied to the existing schedule of fees. The exceptions to this procedure, required because of (i) the consolidation
of forms and (ii) certain technical adjustments, are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exhibit 2, Projected Examinations Fee Account, shows the projected fiscal year 1994 resource allocations to the
Examinations Fee Account. The projected transfers from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation, which are incorporated
in Exhibit 2, are shown in Exhibit 3, Projected Transfers From Salaries and Expenses Appropriation to Examinations
Fee Account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exhibit 4, Proposed Examinations Fee Revenue Adjustment, shows how the proposed fee increase was computed. The calculations
are based on the projected fiscal year 1994 budget, and begin with an estimate of the funds that will remain in the Examinations
Fee Account at the close of fiscal year 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
INS projects that $18.7 million will be carried forward in the Examinations Fee Account from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal
year 1994 (Line 1). Revenue of $314.7 million is anticipated in fiscal year 1994 at the fee levels currently in place
(Line 2). The sum of these two amounts is $333.4 million, which is the total amount projected to be available for the
Examinations Fee Account for fiscal year 1994 in the absence of a fee increase (Line 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INS projects that the costs of Examinations Fee Account programs for fiscal year 1994 will be $331.5 million (Line
4). Because of the impossibility of predicting precisely the number of applications and associated revenue and workload
in any given time period, and in order to ensure that there are sufficient resources to adjudicate applications, including
those currently in process, INS has determined the need to retain a balance equivalent to one month of costs, or $27.6
million (Line 5). The remainder of that amount, if any, would be carried forward to the next fiscal year to continue
processing applications. The existence of a carryforward balance is consistent with INS' past practice. As explained
below, technical adjustments were applied to the fee base for some forms to ensure fair distribution of costs among
users. The net effect of those adjustments is subtracted so that they will have no net impact on the aggregate INS fee
revenue requirement (Line 6). The algebraic sum of these three amounts is the total revenue requirement of $356.9
million (Line 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtracting the revenue requirement from the funds available shows a revenue shortfall of $23.5 million (Line 8).
Dividing this shortfall by the revenues projected under the current fee schedule produces the percentage by which
the fees must be increased, 7.5 percent (Line 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Computation of the Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed fees for most Immigration and Naturalization forms were calculated by applying the increase of 7.5 percent
to the current fee, and rounding the result upward or downward to the nearest $5.00. Fees adjusted in this manner are
shown on Exhibit 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were two exceptions to this computational procedure. One exception is a consequence of forms consolidation
actions affecting the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
I&hyph;129, where procedures and charges have been altered in response to experience with the consolidated forms
and suggestions from users. The new charges associated with the I&hyph;129 are described below, and presented in
Exhibit 6. The other exception is associated with technical adjustments to the computational base for certain forms,
as described below and shown in Exhibit 7.

1. Petition For a Nonimmigrant Worker, I&hyph;129 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 4, 1991, INS published a proposed revision of Form I&hyph;129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (56 FR
50350). This revision consolidated a number of separate application and petition processes that had previously
been handled on separate application forms, each with separate fees. To the extent possible, the new form retained
the original fee structure, which was based upon the costs associated with each separate adjudication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the consolidation of Form I&hyph;129, INS received a number of comments and questions regarding the I&hyph;129
process. As a result, INS proposes to revise Form I&hyph;129 to incorporate several additional processes created
by the Immigration Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;649) and the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization
Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;232), and to simplify the application procedures in response to public comments.
For example, INS proposes to revise procedures in instances where an employer is filing for one worker to allow the
worker's dependents to be included in the petition instead of requiring separate applications. In addition, INS
would no longer require separate petitions for groups where the members will be applying for visas at more than one
consulate or for visa-exempt workers applying for admission at different ports of entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current Form I&hyph;129 Fee Structure: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fee for a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker consists of a base fee of $70 plus either: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_$10 per worker if requesting consulate or port-of-entry notification for visa issuance or admission; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_$80 per worker if requesting a change of status; or

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Form I&hyph;129 Fee Structure: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed fee for a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker is $120 per petition plus $10 for each dependent if filing
for one worker, and $100 per petition plus $20 for each worker if filing for more than one worker. The changes simplify
the application process and more fairly distribute the costs of processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because INS has consolidated actions which were previously separate, data are not yet available for establishing
a fee based upon actual cost experience. Therefore, the proposed fee is based upon estimates of these costs.

2. Technical Adjustments to Computation Base for Certain Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before undertaking the percentage computations to arrive at the fee schedules proposed in this rule, INS reviewed
the cost information supporting the current fee schedule. The information on processing times and related costs,
the costs of FBI name and fingerprint checks, the costs of naturalization ceremonies conducted by United States Courts,
the costs of INS immigration document and card production, the indirect costs and the surcharge were examined. (Copies
of this analysis are available upon request.) Some differences were found between the current fees and the statistical
information on the associated costs. The differences are small, and probably result from data corrections after
the fees were computed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure fair distribution of costs among users, INS adjusted, upward or downward as necessary, the current
fees for forms where differences were identified, before computing the proposed fee increase for those forms. INS
ensured that this process had no net effect on the total revenue increase proposal by deducting the revenue increase
that would be caused by the technical adjustments from the total revenue requirement before calculating the percentage
fee revenue adjustment that would be applied to all forms. As previously noted, this deduction appears on Line 6 of
Exhibit 4, where the fee revision requirement is calculated.

1To distribute costs properly, INS would transfer 143 positions, 133 work years and associated costs. However, in
FY 1994 INS will propose to transfer only 126 positions, 117 work years and associated costs, so that the difference
can be used to support additional work years in the adjudications and naturalization program during the period of
transition when work is shifted to service centers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Immigration and Naturalization Service (the Service) notes that the legislative history on conditional permanent
residence status for alien entrepreneurs is limited in its guidance; therefore, this rule relies heavily on the language
of the statute itself. Congress, however, did indicate that the two-year conditional status for alien entrepreneurs
exists for the primary purpose of ensuring that ``all aliens receiving visas in this section *&blank;*&blank;* continue
their new commercial enterprises so that the creation of U.S. jobs and the infusion of capital into the U.S. economy
is sustained.'' S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;55, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1989).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly the Service proposes to amend 8 CFR parts 211, 216, 235, and 242 by providing conditional permanent resident
status for certain alien entrepreneurs, their spouses, and their children.

Petition for Removal of Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), as amended by the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;649,
November 29, 1990, requires that an alien entrepreneur file a petition for removal of conditions during the 90-day
period before the second anniversary of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent resident status (section 216A(d)(2)(A)
of the Act). The petition should include any spouse or children accorded conditional permanent resident status.
Children who have reached the age of twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional permanent residence
will remain eligible for removal of conditions. The statute also calls for a personal interview of the alien within
90 days after the date the alien files the petition for removal of conditions. The Service may waive the requirement
of an interview in appropriate cases (section 216A(d)(3) of the Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule provides that the required petition shall be filed with the Service Center having jurisdiction over the
location of the alien's commercial enterprise. The petition will be reviewed by the Service Center, and a determination
will be made on the necessity of an interview. If the Service Center director determines in his or her discretion that
a decision may be made on the basis of the petition and accompanying evidence without the necessity of an interview,
the decision on the petition will be rendered at the Service Center. If the director determines that an interview is
needed, the Service Center director will schedule the alien for an interview to be held at the local Service district
office or sub-office having jurisdiction over the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States.
The local district office will then take responsibility for the case to its conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Decision on Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the alien's petition is approved, the conditional basis of the beneficiaries' permanent resident status will
be removed as of the second anniversary of the alien's entry as a conditional permanent resident. Denial of a petition
will result in termination of the alien's lawful permanent resident status and issuance by the Service of an order
to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United States. There is no appeal from this denial, but the
alien may seek review of the decision by the immigration judge in deportation proceedings. In such deportation proceedings,
the burden shall rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information
in the alien's petition for removal of conditions are not true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service explored the possibility of establishing by regulation some form of hardship waiver similar to that set
forth at 8 CFR 216.5 for removal of conditions for certain alien spouses and sons and daughters. The Service has concluded
that such a waiver cannot, consistent with the statute, be created by regulation for alien entrepreneurs. Section
216A(c)(3)(C) of the Act sets out a mandatory instruction: The Attorney General shall terminate the permanent resident
status of an alien entrepreneur who has failed to comply with the requirements for removal of conditions. Unlike section
216, section 216A of the Act does not provide for the waiver of these requirements in cases of hardship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the statute does not provide for a waiver of requirements for removal of conditions for alien entrepreneurs,
the requirement that an alien entrepreneur has sustained his or her investment of the requisite capital during the
two years of conditional residence will be interpreted flexibly. The alien entrepreneur will be considered to have
``sustained'' the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the
capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the
two years of conditional residence. This liberal interpretation of the term ``sustained'' in section 216A(a)(1)(C)
of the Act permits the Service maximum flexibility in determining whether the prerequisites for removal of the conditions
have been met in light of the congressional intent underlying this provision. The Service recognizes that a bona-fide
and good faith investment may not meet all of the expectations envisioned when the alien entrepreneur obtained conditional
residence status. For example, the fact that an alien entrepreneur has less than the requisite capital invested in
the enterprise at the end of the two-year conditional period would not necessarily require the denial of the petition
to remove conditions. The petition could be granted if the alien entrepreneur had invested a substantial portion
of the requisite capital, thereby demonstrating that he or she was actively sustaining his or her investment in the
enterprise as required by the statute. The determination of whether an alien entrepreneur had invested a substantial
portion of the requisite capital in good faith will be made on a case-by-case basis. The proposed rule reflects this
standard at 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii) and 8 CFR 216.6(c)(1)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following example illustrates how the alien entrepreneur can ``substantially meet'' the capital investment
requirement. An alien entrepreneur is granted conditional residence based on a business plan which envisioned an
investment of $1.2 million. At the end of the conditional residence period, he or she has invested only $800,000 in
a non-targeted employment area, because through circumstances beyond the alien's control, construction of a facility
took longer than anticipated. The Service may remove the conditions, if the entrepreneur can show that he or she can
and will invest the additional capital within a reasonable time to complete the investment. On the other hand, if the
entrepreneur cannot show that he or she will be able to generate additional capital within a reasonable time, regardless
of his or her good-faith efforts, the Service will not remove the conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether an alien entrepreneur has demonstrated that he or she invested in good faith, the Service will
examine his or her intent based on both objective and subjective standards. The following example illustrates the
``good faith'' analysis. An entrepreneur invests $600,000 in a non-targeted employment area prior to obtaining
conditional residence, but is unable to provide the additional capital as envisioned in the Form I&hyph;526 application.
At the time he or she obtained conditional residence, he or she had no realistic prospect of obtaining funds to meet
the capital investment requirement and in fact is unable to acquire the additional $400,000 required to complete
the investment. Even though the entrepreneur sincerely wished to make the investment succeed, under the objective
part of the good faith analysis, the entrepreneur will be unable to establish that he or she substantially met the capital
investment requirement in good faith.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also permits the director for good cause to remove conditions for the spouse and/or unmarried minor children
of a deceased principal alien entrepreneur. If the spouse and/or children can show that, despite the entrepreneur's
death, the requirements for removal of conditions have been met, the director may approve the petition and remove
the conditions. This procedure makes humanitarian as well as economic sense and fufills the goals of the statute in
that the economy of the United States will have benefited in the manner sought by Congress notwithstanding the death
of the principal entrepreneur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Reasons for Termination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute calls for termination of the alien's conditional permanent residence status during the two-year period
if the Service determines: That establishment of the new commercial enterprise was for the sole purpose of evading
United States immigration laws; that the new commercial enterprise in fact was not established; that the alien did
not invest or was not in the process of investing the prescribed capital; that the alien was not sustaining the new commercial
enterprise or the investment of capital; or that the alien was not otherwise conforming to the requirements of the
status (section 216A(b)(1) of the Act). If the Service determines any of the foregoing, the alien's status will be
terminated and an order to show cause will be issued. The alien may request review of this decision in deportation proceedings.
In such proceedings, the burden of proof will rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence
that one of the foregoing reasons for termination is true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Termination will also result, and an order to show cause will be issued, if the alien enterpreneur fails to file the
required petition for removal of conditions or, without good cause, fails to appear for a personal interview when
requested by the Service (section 216A(c)(2) of the Act). The decision may be reviewed in deportation proceedings,
but, in either instance, the burden will rest with the alien to show compliance with the filing and interview requirments.
The Service may accept and consider a late petition if the alien demonstrates good cause and extenuating circumstances
for having failed to file a timely petition. Furthermore, the Service may stay deportation proceedings and consider
a petition for an alien who is the subject of deportation proceedings for failure to file a timely petition if the alien
demonstrates good cause and extenuating circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the legislative history of this provision at S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;55, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1989) indicates
Congress's wish that ``*&blank;*&blank;* processing of an individual visa not continue if it becomes known to the
Government that the money invested was obtained by the alien through other than legal means (such as money received
through the sale of illegal drugs).'' This position is clearly part of Congress's general policy to penalize one who
prospers as a result of an illegal enterprise. That policy is evidenced elsewhere in the federal law, such as the statute
which defines money laundering crimes as aggravated felonies, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43), and the provisions of the United
States Code which provide for the forfeiture of proceeds of unlawful activities to the United States, 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(6)
(forfeiture of proceeds of controlled substance exchange) and 18 U.S.C. 1963(a)(3) (forfeiture of proceeds of racketeering
activity or unlawful debt collection). In light of Congress's specific statement of intent with regard to this provision,
and its overall policy concerning proceeds from illegal activities, termination of status will result at any time

Application Fee

In accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;25, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
User Charges,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``user charges will be sufficient to recover the full cost to the Federal Government *&blank;*&blank;* of providing
the service *&blank;*&blank;*. Full cost shall be determined or estimated from the best available records of the
agency *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Service proposes to institute an application fee of $90.00 for filing form I&hyph;829.
This fee is based on the estimated costs of processing the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The I&hyph;829 fee will be one of many examinations fees assessed for providing adjudication and naturalization
services. Each examinations fee has three components: Direct costs, indirect costs, and a surcharge to cover the
costs of the International Affairs and Outreach Program (formerly the Refugees and Overseas Program).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct costs are those costs directly related to the processing of a particular application form for a particular
benefit. Generally, direct costs include: The pay of the adjudications officers and clerical staff working on each
type of application and the costs of their associated personnel benefits; the costs of Federal Bureau of Investigation
name and fingerprint checks; where applicable, the costs by application of naturalization ceremonies conducted
by the United States Courts; and the costs of INS immigration document and card production. The pay costs are calculated
by multiplying average adjudications processing time by the hourly pay for the average grade level of adjudicators
and clerks. For the I&hyph;829, the direct costs include the pay costs of the adjudications officers and clerical
staff and the costs of producing the Alien Registration Card.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indirect costs are defined as the costs of supervisory, management, and administrative activities, related staff
training, records, data processing, files services, legal services, and space and support costs of providing immigration
benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act and related statutes. Indirect costs also include costs in the
management and administration portion of the INS budget, such as the costs of personnel administration work needed
to recruit and pay the officers and clerks who process customers' applications for benefits. The activities associated
with these costs are no less essential to providing INS services to its customers than are the direct costs. These indirect
costs are distinguished only by the somewhat greater complexity of determining the portion of such costs that are
attributable to work done for fee-paying customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs to carry out the International Affairs and Outreach Program are borne by the Examinations Fee Account, at
the direction of Congress. See section 286(m) of the Act. These costs are treated as a surcharge that is added to the
examinations fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost of processing the I&hyph;829 is estimated at $90.45. The proposed fee was determined by rounding the
total cost to the nearest $5.00. As the Service gains experience in processing this new application, the fee will be
adjusted as necessary based on improved data.

Technical Changes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation also contains some minor technical changes resulting from the merger of Form I&hyph;751
and Form I&hyph;752 into the new Form I&hyph;751 (see 56 FR 55931 on October 30, 1991; 57 FR 6181 on February 21, 1992).
This regulation eliminates reference to the Form I&hyph;752, which has been cancelled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Insofar as this proposed rule merely sets forth the procedures for terminating the conditional resident status of
alien entrepreneurs already present in the country and for removing the conditional basis of permanent resident
status for such persons, any impact the proposed rule will have on small business entities will be, at most, indirect
or attenuated. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have
Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains information collection requirements which have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The OMB control numbers for these collections are
contained in 8 CFR 299.5. This rule also contains a new collection requirement which has been forwarded to OMB under
the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act for review and clearance.

conditional permanent resident status if the director determines that any of the conditions set forth in section
216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true, or it becomes known to the government that an
alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her investment capital
through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs). If the Service issues a notice of Intent
to Terminate an alien's conditional resident status, the director shall not adjudicate Form I&hyph;751 or Form I&hyph;829
until it has been determined that the alien's status shall not be terminated. During this time, the alien shall continue
to be a lawful conditional permanent resident with all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities provided to
persons possessing such status. Prior to issuing the Notice of Termination, the director shall provide the alien
with an opportunity to review and rebut the evidence upon which the decision is to be based, in accordance with &sect;103.2(b)(2)
of this chapter. The termination of status, and all of the rights and privileges concomitant thereto (including authorization
to accept or continue in employment in this country), shall take effect as of the date of such determination by the director,
although the alien may request a review of such determination in deportation proceedings. In addition to the notice
of termination, the director shall issue an order to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United
States, in accordance with part 242 of this chapter. During the ensuing deportation proceedings, the alien may submit
evidence to rebut the determination of the director. The burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions in section 216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable,
are true, or that an alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her

A petition to remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status of an alien accorded conditional permanent
residence pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act must be filed by the alien entrepreneur on Form I&hyph;829, Petition
by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions. The alien entrepreneur must file Form I&hyph;829 within the 90-day period
preceding the second anniversary of his or her admission to the United States as a conditional permanent resident.
Before Form I&hyph;829 may be considered as properly filed, it must be accompanied by the fee required under &sect;103.7(b)(1)
of this chapter, and by documentation as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and it must be properly signed
by the alien. Upon receipt of a properly filed Form I&hyph;829, the alien's conditional permanent resident status
shall be extended automatically, if necessary, until such time as the director has adjudicated the petition. The
entrepreneur's spouse and children should be included in the petition to remove conditions. Children who have reached
the age of twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional permanent residence may be included in the
petition.

A petition may be filed regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United States. However, if the
alien is outside the United States at the time of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her spouse
and children, if necessary, to comply with the interview requirements contained in the Act. Once the petition has
been properly filed, the alien may travel outside the United States and return if in possession of documentation as
set forth in &sect;211.1(b)(1) of this chapter, provided the alien complies with the interview requirements described
in paragraph (b) of this section. An alien who is not physically present in the United States during the filing period
but subsequently applies for admission to the United States shall be processed in accordance with &sect;235.11 of

 The petition for removal of conditions must be accompanied by the following evidence: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Evidence that a commercial enterprise was established by the alien. Such evidence may include, but is not limited
to, Federal income tax returns; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Evidence that the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. Such evidence
may include, but is not limited to, an audited financial statement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Evidence that the alien sustained the actions described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section
throughout the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained
the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment
requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional
residence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bank statements, invoices, receipts, contracts, business
licenses, Federal or State income tax returns, and Federal or State quarterly tax statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Evidence that the alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable time ten full-time jobs for qualifying
employees. In the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien entrepreneur must
submit evidence that the commercial enterprise maintained the number of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment
level for the period following his or her admission as a conditional permanent resident. Such evidence may include
payroll records, relevant tax documents and Forms I&hyph;9.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Failure to properly file Form I&hyph;829 within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary
of the date on which the alien obtained lawful permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic
termination of the alien's permanent residence status and the initiation of deportation proceedings. The director
shall send a written notice of termination and an order to show cause to an alien entrepreneur who fails to timely file
a petition for removal of conditions. No appeal shall lie from this decision; however, the alien may request a review
of the determination during deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden of proof shall rest
with the alien to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the requirement to file the petition
within the designated period. The director may deem the petition to have been filed prior to the second anniversary
of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent residence status and accept and consider a late petition if the alien
demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that failure to file a timely petition was for good cause and due to extenuating
circumstances. If the late petition is filed prior to jurisdiction vesting with the immigration judge in deportation
proceedings and the director excuses the late filing and approves the petition, he or she shall restore the alien's
permanent resident status, remove the conditional basis of such status, and cancel any outstanding order to show
cause in accordance with &sect;242.7 of this chapter. If the petition is not filed until after jurisdiction vests
with the immigration judge, the immigration judge may terminate the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the Service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The director of the service center shall review the Form I&hyph;829 and the supporting documents to determine whether
to waive the interview required by the Act. If satisfied that the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this
section have been met, the service center director may waive the interview and approve the petition. If not so satisfied,
then the service center director shall forward the petition to the district director having jurisdiction over the
location of the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States so that an interview of the alien
entrepreneur may be conducted. The director must either waive the requirement for an interview and adjudicate the
petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date on which the petition was properly filed.

Termination of status for failure to appear for interview. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the alien fails to appear for an interview in connection with the petition when requested by the Service, the alien's
permanent resident status will be automatically terminated as of the second anniversary of the date on which the alien
obtained permanent residence. The alien will be provided with written notification of the termination and the reasons
therefore, and an order to show cause shall be issued placing the alien under deportation proceedings. The alien may
seek review of the decision to terminate his or her status in such proceedings, but the burden shall be on the alien to
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the interview requirements. If the alien
has failed to appear for a scheduled interview, he or she may submit a written request to the district director asking
that the interview be rescheduled or that the interview be waived. That request should explain his or her failure to
appear for the scheduled interview, and if a request for waiver of the interview, the reasons such waiver should be
granted. If the district director determines that there is good cause for granting the request, the interview may
be rescheduled or waived, as appropriate. If the district director waives the interview, he or she shall restore the
alien's conditional permanent resident status, cancel any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with &sect;242.7
of this chapter, and proceed to adjudicate the alien's petition. If the district director reschedules that alien's
interview, he or she shall restore the alien's conditional residence status, and cancel any outstanding order to
show cause in accordance with &sect;242.7 of this chapter. If the interview is rescheduled at the request of the alien,
the Service shall not be required to conduct the interview within the 90-day period following the filing of the petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The decision on the petition shall be made within 90 days of the date of filing or within 90 days of the date of interview,
whichever is later. In adjudicating the petition, the director shall determine whether: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A commercial enterprise was established by the alien; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The alien sustained the actions described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section throughout
the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained the actions
required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement
of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable period of time ten full-time jobs to qualifying
employees. In the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien maintained the number
of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment level for the previous two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If derogatory information is determined regarding any of these issues or it becomes known to the government that
the entrepreneur obtained his or her investment funds through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal
drugs), the director shall offer the alien entrepreneur the opportunity to rebut such information. If the alien entrepreneur
fails to overcome such derogatory information or evidence the investment funds were obtained through other than
legal means, the director may deny the petition, terminate the alien's permanent residence, and issue an order to
show cause. If derogatory information not relating to any of these issues is determined during the course of the interview,
such information shall be forwarded to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no unresolved derogatory
information is determined relating to these issues, the petition shall be approved and the conditional basis of the
alien's permanent residence status removed, regardless of any action taken or contemplated regarding other possible
grounds for deportation.

If, after initial review or after the interview, the director approves the petition, he or she will remove the conditional

resident. He or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the alien and shall require the alien to report to
the appropriate district office for processing for a new Alien Registration Receipt Card, Form I&hyph;551, at which
time the alien shall surrender any Alien Registration Receipt Card previously issued.

If, after initial review or after the interview, the director denies the petition, he or she shall provide written
notice to the alien of the decision and the reasons(s) therefor, and shall issue an order to show cause why the alien
should not be deported from the United States. The alien's lawful permanent resident status and that of his or her spouse
and any children shall be terminated as of the date of the director's written decision. The alien shall also be instructed
to surrender any Alien Registration Receipt Card previously issued by the Service. No appeal shall lie from this decision;
however, the alien may seek review of the decision in deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden
shall rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information in the alien's
petition for removal of conditions are not true and that the petition was properly denied.

The lawful permanent resident alien status of a conditional resident automatically terminates if the conditional

(Form I&hyph;751) or, in the case of an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), a Petition
by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions (Form I&hyph;829). Therefore, an alien who is seeking admission as a returning
resident subsequent to the second anniversary of the date on which conditional residence was obtained (except as
provided in &sect;211.1(b)(1) of this chapter) and whose conditional basis of such residence has not been removed
pursuant to section 216(c) or 216A(c) of the Act, whichever is applicable, shall be placed under exclusion proceedings.
However, in a case where conditional residence was based on a marriage, exclusion proceedings may be terminated and
the alien may be admitted as a returning resident if the required petition (Form 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
I&hyph;751) is filed jointly, or by the alien alone (if appropriate), and approved by the Service. In the case of an
alien entrepreneur, exclusion proceedings may be terminated and the alien admitted as a returning resident if the
required petition (Form I&hyph;829) is filed by the alien entrepreneur and approved by the Service.

The respondent may apply to the immigration judge for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act; for
adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, or under section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966, or under section
101 or 104 of the Act of October 28, 1977; or for the creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence
under section 249 of the Act. The application shall be subject to the requirements of parts 244, 245, and 249 of this
chapter. The approval of any application made to the immigration judge under section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse
(as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act),
shall result in the alien's obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance
with the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. However, the Petition to Remove the
Conditions on Residence required by section 216(c) of the Act or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions
required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the director in accordance with part 216 of the chapter. In conjunction
with any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration
judge, if the respondent is inadmissible under any provision of section 212(a) of the Act and believes that he or she
meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration
judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent of his or her apparent eligibility to apply
for any of the benefits enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the respondent an opportunity to make application
therefor during the hearing. In exercising discretionary power when considering an application under this paragraph,
the immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not contained in the record and not made available
for inspection by the respondent, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is relevant and
is classified under Executive Order No. 12356 (47 14874, April 6, 1982) as requiring protection from unauthorized
disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever the immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while
safeguarding both the information and its source, the immigration judge should inform the respondent of the general
nature of the information in order that the respondent may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision
based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state that the information is material to the decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10(j)(1) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires each Federal Home Loan Bank (Bank) to establish a Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to subsidize the interest rate on advances to members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Home Loan Bank System (Bank System) engaged in lending for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term, low- and moderate-income, owner-occupied and affordable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing at subsidized interest rates. The Board is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to promulgate regulations governing the Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(1). The Board's existing regulation governing the operation of the AHP appears at part 960 of the
Board's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 12 CFR part 960. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule amends the Board's existing AHP regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to address operational issues that have arisen during the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and one-half years that the AHP has been in existence. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments are intended to make the AHP more responsive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to low-income housing needs in each of the twelve Federal Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loan Bank Districts (Districts), to increase efficiency in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the Program, and to enhance coordination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP with other housing programs whose funds are used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with AHP funds. These issues are discussed in greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detail below in the Analysis of Proposed Rule section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. AHP Application Approval Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule makes a fundamental change to the AHP by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vesting the Banks, instead of the Board, with the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve AHP applications. The current application approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process implemented by the Board's existing AHP regulation may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
briefly described as follows. The Banks receive AHP applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and first evaluate them for satisfaction of certain threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements contained in the existing regulation. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.5(a)(1), (2). Those applications meeting the threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are evaluated by the Banks to determine if they meet at least three of the priorities contained in the
existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. If they do, they are scored by the Banks on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priorities and on other scoring objectives contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulation before applications that meet fewer than three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priorities. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;960.5(a)(3), (b) through (e). Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulation, the Bank then forwards to the Board the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest scoring applications, and submits a summary of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;960.5(f)(1), (2). The Board reviews the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications to ensure consistency with the threshold, priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and scoring requirements, and makes final funding decisions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While section 10(j) of the Act requires each Bank to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an AHP, and vests in the Board broad authority to regulate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks' AHP activities through regulations implementing the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 10(j) does not specifically assign the responsibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating the AHP to the Board. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). The Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does have other statutorily designated duties, including issuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that specify activities eligible to receive subsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advances under the AHP, ensuring advances are used to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects for which adequate long-term monitoring is available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring that a preponderance of assistance provided under the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is ultimately received by low- and moderate-income households, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring that AHP subsidies provided by Banks to members are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passed on to the ultimate borrower. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1430(j)(9) (A), (C), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D), (E). However, section 10(j) does not specify what entity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for administering the AHP, and what entity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for determining which AHP applications are approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the following reasons, the Board is proposing that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks assume the responsibility for determining which AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications are approved for funding. First, the Banks have had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three and one-half years of experience with the AHP, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience has included processing AHP applications, scoring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications, and recommending applications for approval to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board as described above. Consequently, the Banks are already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing and reviewing applications under the existing system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, decentralization of the AHP is consistent with the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System's Strategic Plan, which calls for decentralization of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of functions currently conducted by the Board, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception of those Board activities involving oversight and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision of the Banks. See ``System 2000: A Long-Term Strategic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan For The Federal Home Loan Bank System.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The details of the proposed new application approval process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed further below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board specifically requests comments as to whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks should be given the authority to approve and disapprove AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also revises the Board's existing AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation by allowing each Bank to define more specifically its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own priorities and scoring criteria, subject to certain overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority and scoring parameters established in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank would be required to include such proposed priorities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scoring criteria in its AHP implementation plan which must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Board. Under the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Banks have much less flexibility in defining priorities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scoring criteria. See 12 CFR 960.5 (a) through (e). In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the proposed rule, certain point values for scoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories would be revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The details of the proposed revisions for adopting priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and scoring criteria are discussed further below under the scoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of AHP applications section.

B. Bank Establishment of AHP and Adoption of AHP Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.2(a) of the proposed rule generally reiterates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement in &sect;960.2(a) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is the policy of the Board and the Banks to promote decent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safe affordable housing and to address critical affordable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing needs through providing subsidized advances and direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidies to members pursuant to the AHP. See 12 CFR 960.2(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.2(b) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board of directors shall establish an AHP, which shall be funded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the requirements of &sect;960.18 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See discussion below under the required annual AHP contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section.) The Bank is required to make subsidized advances to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants pursuant to its AHP and to operate its AHP in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity with an annual AHP implementation plan and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this part. Direct subsidies provided by a Bank to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants pursuant to its AHP also shall be provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity with the Bank's AHP implementation plan and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this part. Each Bank's AHP implementation plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be approved by the Board before it is effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.2(b) of the proposed rule further provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP implementation plan must meet the requirements of this part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and shall include:

Section 960.3 of the proposed rule, consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.3(b) (1) and (2) of the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that applicants may use subsidized advances or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidies received from a Bank under the AHP to either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Finance the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied housing units by or for low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Finance the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing units, at least 20 percent of the units of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income households. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.3(c) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that ``Program funds may only be used for direct costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to produce and/or finance affordable housing units.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 960.3(c). A number of questions have arisen as to whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific types of costs associated with the financing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of housing may be considered ``direct costs'' for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the Board's regulation. Because of the confusion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this area, the Board believes that it would be helpful to set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in the rule examples of specific types of costs it considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be authorized and unauthorized for AHP purposes. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.4(a) (1) and (2) of the proposed rule sets forth examples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific costs related to the purchase, construction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation of housing that are authorized and unauthorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses of AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it is impossible to anticipate all types of costs that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arise in the course of financing or producing housing, the list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized and unauthorized costs in proposed &sect;960.4(a) is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive. Other costs not included arguably may or may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify as costs of financing the purchase, construction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation of housing. If an applicant seeks to use funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the AHP to pay for costs not specifically included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, it should consult with the Bank before submitting its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for approval. The Board specifically asks for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments as to whether these authorized and unauthorized costs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, &sect;960.4(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized uses of subsidized advances or direct subsidies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, but are not limited to, the following costs related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Real property purchase and improvement costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Construction or rehabilitation costs, including labor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, and contractor profit and overhead allowances; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Costs integral to the purchase or development of housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including, but not limited to, project-related: Architectural, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and engineering fees; local building permit and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning fees; accounting costs; survey costs; appraisal fees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title insurance and other insurance costs; performance bond and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other bond fees; recording fees; credit report fees; property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxes; residential relocation costs where such costs are part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relocation plan; legal fees; syndication fees; costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
translating resident documents to another language; loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment, loan origination and other loan financing fees for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative costs other than costs of administering the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award; developer's fees; and marketing costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Prepayment fees imposed by the Bank on an applicant for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized advance that is prepaid in connection with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant requires the borrower to pay such fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Capitalization of reserve fund(s) necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful operation of rental housing projects, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement reserves, rent-up reserves, operating deficit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves, and sinking fund reserves used for the transfer of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project to nonprofit ownership when associated with a low income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing tax credit transaction (26 U.S.C. 42); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Cancellation fees imposed by the Bank on an applicant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a subsidized advance commitment that is canceled and converted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and disbursed as a direct subsidy in connection with the purchase, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction or rehabilitation of housing, if the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the borrower to pay such fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Refinancing of an existing loan in conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing, provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized advance or direct subsidy and the proceeds of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refinancing are used only to retire existing debt and to benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low- or moderate-income households and, in the case of refinancing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to rehabilitate a project, there is a minimum of $2,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per unit spent on such rehabilitation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Tenant services, tenant counseling and homeowner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counseling costs that are a condition imposed by a lender to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain financing from such lender and which are necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful operation of the project.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cancellation fees identified in paragraph (vi) above, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower is required to pay the fee, are a cost of financing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such purchase, construction or rehabilitation and therefore are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized uses of funds under the AHP. Because the advance would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be converted to a direct subsidy, such cancellation fees would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable only if the application also meets the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of applications contained in &sect;960.11 of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. (These requirements are discussed in greater detail in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification section below.) However, AHP subsidized advances or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct subsidies may not be used to pay for cancellation fees in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations where the cancellation of the advance is not part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restructuring that results in the purchase, construction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation of housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conditions identified in paragraph (vii) above on the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of funds under the AHP for refinancing are intended to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the funds are not used by the borrower to take out its equity in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project and to ensure that the funds are used for authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes under the AHP. The Board specifically requests comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on whether the $2,500 minimum per unit is a reasonable minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount to be required to be spent on rehabilitation in conjunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a refinancing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions have arisen as to whether funds under the AHP should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to pay for pre-development costs that may or may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing. Pre-development costs are costs incurred prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing of a purchase, construction or rehabilitation loan for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of determining the feasibility of a proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of pre-development costs include architectural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering fees, legal fees, the costs of surveys and appraisals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local building permit and planning fees, and earnest money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits. Since AHP applications are required to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold feasibility requirement provided in proposed &sect;960.9(d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to be scored, authorizing the use of funds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-development costs raises the question how applications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such costs can or should be scored since the funds would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursed to applicants before the feasibility of a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project could be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there is a greater likelihood that costs incurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the pre-feasibility period, rather than during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-feasibility period, will not result in the purchase, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction or rehabilitation of housing. Thus, if applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for AHP funds to finance pre-development costs are approved, AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds in perhaps significant amounts could go towards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-development costs that do not result in the financing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of housing. If such costs are authorized, one option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dealing with this concern could be to cap the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP funds that may be used for pre-development costs at a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amount or percentage, such as the lesser of $200,000 or 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the Bank's total AHP contributions for the year. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds could be set aside and disbursed in a separate competitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board specifically requests comments on whether funds under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP should be used for pre-development costs, how applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such costs can or should be scored, and what limits, if any, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be placed on the amount of funds used for such purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the AHP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.4(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total amount of a direct subsidy provided by the Bank to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant under the AHP must be passed on by the applicant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient. Consistent with &sect;960.9(c) of the Board's existing AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, &sect;960.4(b)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an applicant receiving a subsidized advance shall extend credit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower at a rate of interest equal to the rate of interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged on the subsidized advance plus an interest rate spread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Bank. See 12 CFR 960.9(c). These provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act, which provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board's AHP regulation shall ensure that AHP subsidies provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks to applicants are passed on to the ultimate borrower. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant receives a subsidized advance or direct subsidy from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank or prepayment of a loan originally made under the AHP, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest or other income earned by the applicant on such funds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not including any approved fee or interest rate spread charged to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower, must be forwarded to the Bank to be used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional AHP projects, except for interest or other income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earned by the applicant within 30 calendar days of receiving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized advance or direct subsidy or of receiving prepayment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a loan originally made under the AHP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(b)(3) of the proposed rule provides that a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy received by an applicant from a Bank that is provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such applicant to a sponsor may be lent by the sponsor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with an AHP rental housing project involving low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing tax credits (LIHTC), provided the subsidy is lent by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor for a term of not less than 30 years, with all principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and interest payments deferred until the end of such term. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a loan is repaid before the end of the 30-year term, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire amount of the direct subsidy must be repaid to the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For various tax reasons, sponsors prefer to structure LIHTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects so that the AHP direct subsidy is lent to the project for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific long-term period, with principal and interest payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deferred until the end of such term. The lending of a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy by a sponsor raises the question whether the subsidy is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being passed on to the ultimate recipient, as required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act and proposed &sect;960.4(b)(1)(i), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the subsidy ultimately is being repaid to the Bank. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). The Board believes that the lending of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct subsidy for the long-term period of income eligibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordability required by &sect;960.5 of the proposed rule, with all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term, satisfies section 10(j)(9)(E) and proposed &sect;960.4(b)(1)(i), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the project will have had the use of such funds for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period the project must remain occupied by and affordable for low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or moderate-income households, even though the funds may be repaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the end of such term. As discussed below, &sect;960.5(a)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule defines this long-term period generally as not less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 30 years for rental housing projects. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct subsidy must be lent for a term of 30 years or more, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(b)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant receives a subsidized advance or a direct subsidy from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank, and in turn provides both a loan and a grant to a borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and charges an origination fee for providing the loan, then any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee charged by the applicant for providing the grant may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid with the AHP subsidized advance or direct subsidy. The fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be paid with the AHP subsidized advance because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant has already covered the underwriting costs for the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the grant in its origination fee for the loan. The fee may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be paid with the direct subsidy because otherwise the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the AHP subsidy would not be passed through to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower, as required by section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;960.4(b)(1)(i). See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E).

Section 10(j)(1) of the Act states that pursuant to regulations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidize the interest rate on advances to members engaged in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations shall permit Bank members to use subsidized advances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from the Banks to finance homeownership by families with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income for the area.

 &sect;1430(j)(2)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act permits more than one possible interpretation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that owner-occupied housing must be ``long-term.'' One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way to interpret this requirement is that owner-occupied housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units assisted under the AHP must be added to and retained as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the stock of affordable housing for a long-term period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the Act may be interpreted to require that under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP, assistance must be provided to low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households to make owner-occupied housing units affordable to such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households for as long as they own the unit. These two possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretations are incorporated in options A and B described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. The Board specifically requests comments on these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option A. Under option A, the long-term requirement would be met by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing that owner-occupied housing units be required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained as affordable units for 30 years or, at the election of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sponsor, the remaining useful life of the units, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in occupancy. In order to enforce this retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, owner-occupied units assisted with a loan or a grant

under the AHP would have to be subject to a deed restriction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other legally enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit to a low- or moderate-income household if the unit were sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 30 years of the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or prior to the end of the remaining useful life of the unit, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case may be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A household purchasing such a unit would have to qualify as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low- or moderate-income household only at the time of purchase or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of closing on the financing for the unit. A household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitating a unit would have to qualify as a low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income household only at the time the household received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a commitment for funding through the AHP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a loan under the AHP were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to either: (1) Repay to the Bank that portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance used to make the loan to the seller, or (2) convert that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant under the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the seller would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to repay to the applicant a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of the grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any profit realized upon the sale of the unit, and any amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaid to the applicant would have to be forwarded to the Bank and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made available for additional AHP projects. The Bank would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discretion to waive this recapture requirement if imposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the requirement would cause undue hardship on the seller, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan. In addition, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied units assisted by a grant, the Bank would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor the unit during the required long-term period by reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land title records or reports or certifications from the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or a regulatory agency, as determined by each Bank in its AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan, to determine whether the unit had been sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a household whose income exceeded a low-or moderate-income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to requiring that each owner-occupied unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assisted by a grant be subject to a restriction on transfer, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank could have a legally binding agreement with the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing that if such unit were sold prior to the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required long-term period to a household that was not a low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income household, the sponsor would make another unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to a low- or moderate-income household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under option B, the long-term requirement would be met by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing that an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan under the AHP must be affordable for the initial household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the duration of that household's occupancy of the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, to minimize opportunities for speculation, the unit would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to be subject to a deed restriction or other legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of the unit to a low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or moderate-income household if the unit were sold within five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years of the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As under option A, a household purchasing such a unit under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option B would have to qualify as a low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household only at the time of purchase or at the time of closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the financing for the unit, and a household rehabilitating a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit would have to qualify as a low- or moderate-income household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only at the time the household received a commitment for funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the AHP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a loan under the AHP were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold prior to the end of the five-year period to a household that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to either: (1) Repay to the Bank that portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance used to make the loan to the seller, or (2) convert that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant under the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were sold prior to the end of the five-year period to a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the seller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to repay to the applicant a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant from any profit realized upon the sale of the unit, and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount repaid to the applicant would have to be forwarded to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank and made available for additional AHP projects. The Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have the discretion to waive this recapture requirement if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of the requirement would cause undue hardship on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seller, as defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, for owner-occupied units assisted by a grant, the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to monitor the unit during the required long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period by reviewing land title records or reports or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications from the sponsor or a regulatory agency, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by each Bank in its AHP implementation plan, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the unit had been sold to a household whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income exceeded a low or moderate income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As under option A, as an alternative to requiring that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant be subject to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restriction on transfer, the Bank under option B could have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally binding agreement with the sponsor providing that if such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit were sold prior to the end of the required long-term period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sponsor would make another unit available to a low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income household.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``very low-income household''. Section 10(j)(13)(A) of the Act defines the term ``low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income household'' as a household which has an income of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80 percent or less of the area median. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(j)(13)(B) of the Act defines the term ``very low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household'' as a household that has an income of 50 percent or less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the area median.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section 1430(j)(13)(B). Thus, the term low- or moderate-income household incorporates households that meet the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of very low-income household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's existing AHP regulation defines ``low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income households'' as households for which the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income is 80 percent or less of the area median income, and ``very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income households'' as households for which the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income is 50 percent or less of the area median income. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 960.1(g), (o). ``Median income'' is defined as ``the median 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family income for an area as determined and published by the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Housing and Urban Development.''

``Area'' is defined as ``a metropolitan statistical area, a county,

(i) Adjustments of income limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1993, the Board published a proposed rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend the definitions of these terms. See 58 FR 58988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(November 5, 1993). As discussed in the preamble to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment, under section 3 of the United States Housing Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1937, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development (Secretary) establishes income limits to be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether a family qualifies as a ``low-income family'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a ``very low-income family'' that is eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HUD) housing programs. See 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2). These income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits are calculated as a percentage of the median income of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four-person family living in a particular area. In general, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income limit for qualifying as a ``low-income family'' is set at 80 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the area median income, and the income limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifying as a ``very low-income family'' is set at 50 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area median income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary may adjust the income limits for very low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families and low-income families upward or downward to take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account unusually high or low family incomes in an area. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the income limit for low-income families may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted to take into account prevailing levels of construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Then an adjustment in this figure is made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the comparable income limits for larger and smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families living in the area. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 31 higher-income metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18 counties, the Secretary adjusts the area-based income limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a four-person, low-income family downward if it would otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the U.S. median income for a four-person family. In these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, the Secretary caps the income limit for a four-person, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income family at the U.S. median income for a four-person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In four MSAs and 107 counties, the Secretary adjusts the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area-based income limit for four-person, very low- and low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families downward because housing costs are low compared to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adjusting the income limit downward decreases the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households in an area that are eligible to receive assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under HUD's housing programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the proposed amendment, the Board believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordable housing financed through the AHP should be available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the greatest number of households possible, within the limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the Act. Further, households should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from affordable housing in a particular local market on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis that housing costs are lower or household incomes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher in that market than in other regions of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applying the income limits that have been adjusted downward for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or unusually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high household incomes for purposes of administering the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the number of households eligible to live in affordable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing financed through the AHP. This limits a member's ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use funds under the AHP to fulfill its obligation under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Community Reinvestment Act. See 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits a member's ability to use funds under the AHP to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``community investment or service'' requirement of section 10(g) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, 12 U.S.C. 1430(g), and the Board's Community Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation, 12 CFR part 936. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Board is proposing that in administering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP and in defining the standards governing the ``community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment or service'' requirement of the Act, the income limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to determine whether a household in a particular area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifies as a ``very low-income household'' or as a ``low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income household'' should not be adjusted downward based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or unusually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high household incomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.1 of this proposed rule defines ``low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household'' as a household which has an income of 80 percent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less of the median income for the area, as adjusted and published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HUD, except in areas where the Secretary adjusts this figure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downward because of prevailing construction costs, low housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs, or unusually high household incomes. For areas where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary makes this downward adjustment, ``low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household'' would be defined to mean a household which has an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income of 80 percent or less of the median income for the area, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published by HUD, with adjustment for household size, but without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adjustments made by the Secretary for prevailing construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs, low housing costs, or unusually high household incomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.1 of this proposed rule defines ``very low-income household'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a household which has an income of 50 percent or less of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
median income for the area, as adjusted and published by HUD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except in areas where the Secretary adjusts this figure downward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unusually high household incomes. For areas where the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes this downward adjustment, ``very low-income household'' would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be defined to mean a household which has an income of 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or less of the median income for the area, as published by HUD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with adjustment for household size, but without the adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the Secretary for prevailing construction costs, low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing costs, or unusually high household incomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While HUD publishes tables with adjusted income information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that incorporates the adjustments for family size, prevailing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction costs, low housing costs, and unusually high family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incomes, it does not publish tables with income information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusts only for family size and not these other factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment, &sect;960.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this proposed rule adds a definition of ``adjustment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household size'' in order to provide additional guidance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating this adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adjustment for household size is made by taking a specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the income limit of a four-person household for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular area, according to the following scale:

For each person in excess of eight, eight percent of the four-person household base income limit should be added to
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income limit for an eight-person household for the area. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment factors are the same as those used by HUD in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering its housing programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``area'' from the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.1(c). ``Area'' means, for purposes of defining ``median income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the area,'' a metropolitan statistical area, a county, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonmetropolitan area, as established by the U.S. Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget. Consistent with the proposed amendment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.1 of this proposed rule does not include a definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``median income'' because it is included in the proposed definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``very low-income household'' and ``low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Definition of ``income''. The Act is silent on how to define the term ``income,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what are eligible sources of household income that should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in determining whether the household satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``low- or moderate-income household'' or ``very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income household.'' The Board has determined not to define the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term ``income'' in the proposed rule. Homeownership projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typically involve the participation of a lender which provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent financing for the homeowner over an extended period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. The lender generally verifies a household's income prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing a financing commitment during the underwriting of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan. Eligible sources of income are identified by the lender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the mortgage underwriting process. Identifying eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources of income in the rule could cause inconsistency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders' customary and usual underwriting practices, or with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards applied by the entity providing the major source of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing for the project.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rental housing units. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.5(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides generally that at least 20 percent of the rental housing units in
a project financed under the AHP with subsidized advances or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidies shall remain affordable for and occupied by very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income households for a minimum period of 30 years or, at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;960.5(a)(1) implements section 10(j)(2)(B) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, which provides that Bank members may use subsidized advances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from the Banks to finance the purchase, construction, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation of rental housing, at least 20 percent of the units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households for the remaining useful life of such housing or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortgage term. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(2)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;960.5(a)(1) provides that the applicant and project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordability and income-targeting requirements. In addition, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant may commit to maintain additional units as affordable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for and occupied by low- or moderate-income households, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment shall be a minimum period of 30 years or, at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Long-term requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10(j) of the Act does not define ``remaining useful life'' as used in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act. See 12
U.S.C. 1430(j). However, the legislative history of section 21A(c) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act regarding residential properties sold by the Resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trust Corporation (RTC), which was enacted as part of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation that enacted section 10(j), states that the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life of such RTC property is intended to cover the property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as long as it is habitable and assumes good faith efforts by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchaser to maintain the property and to rehabilitate it as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. See Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Conference, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101&hyph;222, 101st Cong., 1st 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sess., 419 (1989) (FIRREA Conference Report); 12 U.S.C. 1441a(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RTC has in fact adopted a specific uniform period of useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life for all buildings instead of a period of useful life based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical habitability. See 12 CFR 1609.2(kk). The legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history of a recently enacted affordable housing statute, the Low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Income Housing Preservation and Residential Homeownership Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(LIHPRHA), provides further support for a definition of ``remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life'' based on the period of physical habitability of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property by explicitly rejecting the RTC's regulatory definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;960.1 of the proposed rule defines ``remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life'' as the period during which the housing remains in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition suitable for occupancy, assuming normal maintenance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repairs are made and major systems and capital components are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced or repaired as becomes necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(j) of the Act does not define ``mortgage term'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history of section 10(j) states that the conferees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expect that the Board will encourage the use of the longest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable mortgage term in order to aid in making the housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordable for very low-income households. See FIRREA Conference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report at 431. Accordingly, the Board believes that ``mortgage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term'' should be defined as the mortgage term only of long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortgage loans and believes that 30 years is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress' intent in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted rental housing projects remain occupied by and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordable for income-eligible households for a long-term period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``very low-income household''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``very low-income household'' discussed above for AHP-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied housing projects apply for AHP-assisted rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing projects as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the definition of ``income,'' rental housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects typically have multiple providers of financing, each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may specify the eligible sources of income, which sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflict with each other. However, as with AHP-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied housing projects, the Board has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule should not specify the eligible sources of income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for rental housing projects, but rather that applicants should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to follow their usual underwriting guidelines, or may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow those of the predominant source of financing in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project.

Increase in household income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.5(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households occupying a rental housing unit subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must satisfy the income-eligibility requirement applicable to such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-targeted unit, as committed to in the AHP application, upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial occupancy. The household may continue to occupy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-targeted unit even if its income increases above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-eligibility requirement for such unit. The unit may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains affordable to the household as defined in proposed &sect;960.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as further discussed below). However, if the household's income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rises above 140 percent of the income-targeting level committed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the AHP application, the sponsor must make the next available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing unit in the project affordable to and available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupancy by a household whose income is at or below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original unit. Once the next available rental housing unit is so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied, the rent charged on the unit occupied by the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose income has risen shall no longer be subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that it be affordable for households at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach is consistent with the approach followed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LIHTC program. Under the LIHTC program, a unit is in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the occupancy requirements until the tenant's income has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risen to 140 percent of the qualifying income. See 26 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;42(g)(2)(D)(i). The next available unit must then be rented to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-eligible tenant at an affordable rent. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42(g)(2)(D)(ii). This approach allows the household to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stability by allowing increases in income without fear of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement or increased rents. In addition, it does not cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destabilization of the project's cash flow by having the project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor provide additional income-eligible units with reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rents that may reduce the income of the project. It also would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the treatment of rents under the AHP's 20 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement (also known as the maximum subsidy rule), which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently an interim rule of the Board, and which is incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;960.9(c) of this proposed rule. (See discussion of 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent requirement below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.1 of the proposed rule defines ``affordable for very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income households'' to mean: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For purposes of rental housing units, that rents, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable utility costs, charged to households for such units do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exceed 30 percent of the income of a household (assuming a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household size of 1.5 persons per bedroom or 1.0 person per unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without a separate bedroom) which has an income of 50 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the median income for the area, as adjusted and published by HUD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that in areas where the Secretary adjusts this income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figure downward because of prevailing construction costs, low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing costs, or unusually high household incomes, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``affordable for very low-income households'' means that rents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including reasonable utility costs, charged to households for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units do not exceed 30 percent of the income of a household which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has an income of 50 percent of the median income for the area, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published by HUD, with adjustment for household size, but without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adjustments made by the Secretary for prevailing construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs, low housing costs, or unusually high household incomes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a rental unit is targeted to a household whose income is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 50 percent of the median income for the area, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``affordable for very low-income households'' means that the rent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including reasonable utility costs, charged to a household for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such unit does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum qualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income of the targeted households of the size expected to occupy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed definition implements section 10(j)(13)(D) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, which defines ``affordable for very low-income households'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mean that rents charged to tenants for units made available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupancy by low-income families shall not exceed 30 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the income for the area (as determined by the Secretary of HUD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with adjustment for family size. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.1(b) of the Board's existing AHP regulation contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of the term that is similar to the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. See 12 CFR 960.1(b).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that an estimate for reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility costs should be included in the determination of rents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged to households under this section, if they are not already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the projected rents. Including utility costs would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the housing cost burden for very low-income households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the AHP, and would allow all rental projects to be treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equally, since some projects include the cost of utilities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rent, while others do not include such costs in the rent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Including utility costs would be consistent with the treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rents in other federal housing programs, such as HUD's Section 8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and the LIHTC program. It also would be consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment of rents under the AHP's 20 percent requirement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is currently an interim rule of the Board, and which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in &sect;960.9(c) of this proposed rule. (See discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 20 percent requirement below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``affordable for low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households'' in &sect;960.1 of the proposed rule is similar to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above definition, except that the household must have an income of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80 percent, instead of 50 percent, of the median income for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, since the Act defines a ``low- or moderate-income household'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as any household which has an income of 80 percent or less of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area median. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sale of AHP-assisted rental housing project.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.5(a)(3) of the proposed rule provides that an owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell the project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the end of the long-term period during which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the levels committed to in the AHP application; however, either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The purchaser must agree to continue the project's rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to the seller; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph a. above, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seller must repay a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of the grant as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.16(d)(1); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph a. above, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the seller, then the provisions of &sect;960.16(d)(2) shall apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;960.5(b) further provides that the Bank's AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan shall permit the owner of an AHP-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing project to sell such project as provided for in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Establishment of AHP Funding Cycles and Available AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsidies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.6(a)(1) of the proposed rule requires each Bank to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish at least two but no more than four AHP funding cycles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year during which applications for AHP subsidized advances or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct subsidies will be accepted. This is a change from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board's existing AHP regulation, which provides that the Banks may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accept AHP applications during two of four quarterly periods each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. See 12 CFR 960.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.6(a)(1) of the proposed rule also provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP funding cycle schedule, including application due dates, is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined by the Bank in its discretion, but shall allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient time intervals to ensure an adequate pool of applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to compete in each funding cycle. The funding cycles schedule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including application due dates, shall be described in detail in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank's AHP implementation plan. This is also a change from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board's existing AHP regulation, which sets forth specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application due dates. See 12 CFR 960.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.6(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank shall inform the general public and its members of the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and dates of its AHP funding cycles for the year and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximate amount of available AHP subsidies for each funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle at least 45 calendar days before the due date for AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for the first funding cycle for the year. This is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change from the Board's existing AHP regulation, which requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each Bank to announce its funding cycles by December 1 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding year, and to notify only its members of the approximate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of AHP subsidies to be offered in each funding cycle. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 960.4(a), (b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with &sect;960.4(b) of the Board's existing AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, &sect;960.6(b) of the proposed rule provides that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank shall allocate comparable amounts of AHP subsidies for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP funding cycle during the year. See 12 CFR 960.4(b).

E. Specific Application and Scoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Application Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule does not mandate use of a uniform AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application form by all of the Banks. Rather, the Board believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, consistent with current practice under the AHP, each Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should continue to devise its own AHP application form, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each Bank will have its own special information requirements as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the specific priorities and scoring criteria adopted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed further below, all AHP applications must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy certain threshold requirements in order to be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for scoring under the proposed rule. Thus, certain information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from applicants must be received by all Banks in order for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks to be able to determine whether the applications satisfy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold requirements in the proposed rule and to score the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications under the scoring criteria. Accordingly, &sect;960.7(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed rule provides that each Bank shall require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants for subsidized advances or direct subsidies under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP to submit to the Bank an application which, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains all of the information described below and any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information which the Bank determines is necessary in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take action on such application, including the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A concise description of the purpose of the request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed uses of the funds, and its relationship to the priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in proposed &sect;960.10(d), the targeting criterion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in proposed &sect;960.10(e), and the other objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in proposed &sect;960.10(f); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A statement of how the project will satisfy the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses and long-term requirements, including a description of legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms to be used to ensure compliance by the project with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such requirements, contained in proposed &sect;&sect;960.3 and 960.5; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A statement of how the project will comply with the fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing law requirement contained in proposed &sect;960.9(b); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A statement of how the project will satisfy the feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement contained in proposed &sect;960.9(d); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A statement of how the project's sponsor satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualification requirement contained in proposed &sect;960.9(e); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A statement of whether a subsidized advance or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy has been requested and the amount of such funds requested; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) A disclosure of whether or not the applicant has a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or indirect interest in the property or project. If the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has an interest in the property and the application is approved, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then prior to the transfer of AHP funds to the project, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent current appraisal of the fair market value of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property must be provided, unless the applicant demonstrates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the property is being sold or otherwise transferred to the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a price substantially below the fair market value; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) A statement of the project's costs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) A certification from the applicant's, the sponsor's and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan fund's or loan consortium's board of directors, or president 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or senior officer if so delegated by the board of directors, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or loan consortium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will comply with all requirements of this part and all obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(c) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally requires an applicant to include in its AHP application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information identified in paragraphs (3) through (6) above, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as any other information the Bank may require. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.4(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(c)(6) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires an applicant to disclose in its AHP application any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct or indirect interest of the applicant in the property or project. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(6). Under &sect;960.7(a)(7)
of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, if such an interest exists and the application is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved, then prior to the transfer of AHP funds to the project, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant generally is required to provide an appraisal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property or project. This is to ensure that the sales price of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such property or project owned by the applicant has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inflated and that the applicant is not receiving the benefit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP subsidy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(c)(7) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the applicant to include in its AHP application an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explanation of how the applicant intends to monitor the use of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds received under the AHP, including an explanation of how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure of the project ensures that a preponderance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy is ultimately received by the targeted beneficiaries. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(D); 12 CFR 960.4(c)(7). As discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater detail in the monitoring section below, as long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate monitoring is otherwise provided for, the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not require the applicant in all instances to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted project for compliance with the long-term requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed rule. Accordingly, this provision of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation is deleted in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(c)(8) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the applicant to certify that the maximum subsidy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation requirements of the AHP rule will not be violated. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 960.4(c)(8). However, since the maximum subsidy limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are threshold requirements that all AHP applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must satisfy (see discussion below of the 20 percent requirement), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement is incorporated into proposed &sect;960.7(a)(9), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provides generally that the applicant and sponsor must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify that all requirements of the AHP regulation will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.4(c)(8) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the applicant to explain in its AHP application how any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP subsidy that exceeds the maximum subsidy requirements will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recaptured. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(8). Since AHP applications must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the threshold maximum subsidy limitation requirements at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the outset in order to be scored and approved for AHP funding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this issue does not arise and therefore has been deleted in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the requirement in &sect;960.4(c)(9) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board's existing AHP regulation that the applicant's managing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer must certify that the AHP subsidy shall be only for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized uses is expanded in proposed &sect;960.7(a)(9) to require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification by the applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan consortium not only that funds received under the AHP will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for authorized uses, but also a certification of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all requirements of the AHP regulation and all obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(9). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the proposed rule requires the applicant, the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the loan fund or loan consortium, not just the applicant, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Board's existing AHP regulation, to make the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the AHP application. This change is proposed because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or loan consortium are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all subject to specific requirements under the AHP and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be required to certify that they will comply with such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Action on Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the proposed rule makes a major change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board's existing AHP regulation by taking the Board out of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval process for AHP applications. Section 960.7(b)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule provides that each Bank shall review, score and take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action on an AHP application pursuant to the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in proposed &sect;&sect;960.8, 960.9 and 960.10, and shall notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant of such action no later than 60 calendar days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application due date for the AHP funding cycle. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.5(f)(1) of the existing regulation requires the Banks to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forward to the Board their recommended applications no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days after each offering deadline. See 12 CFR 960.5(f)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Banks would have greater responsibilities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval process under the proposed rule, the 30-day period is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to be extended to 60 calendar days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.7(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the board of directors of each Bank shall have the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to approve or disapprove AHP applications received, and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegate such authority to the president or other senior officers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Bank.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.7(b)(3) of the proposed rule provides that within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 calendar days of each Bank's approval of the AHP applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a given AHP funding cycle, the Bank shall forward to the Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a summary of each approved AHP application. The summary shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Briefly describe the project, including the applicant, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan fund or loan consortium, if applicable, and the sponsor_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether nonprofit, for-profit or public agency, the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing, the location, the long-term period committed to, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of housing units including the number of units affordable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for very low-, low- or moderate-income households or for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households at any other income levels committed to in the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, the development cost, other financing sources, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special needs populations served; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) State the reason for the points awarded under each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's scoring criteria for the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Indicate whether a subsidized advance or direct subsidy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was approved by the Bank for the project, the use of such funds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the amount of such funds approved; if a subsidized advance was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved, the summary shall indicate the amount of the advance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the advance rate, the amortization schedule for the advance, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term to maturity, the applicable cost of funds, and the date as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the cost of funds was determined; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Indicate whether the project received approval in a prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP funding cycle, or whether the project is an extension, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion, continuation or reconfiguration of a previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved AHP project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Describe how the project will be monitored and by what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Describe the legal mechanisms to be used to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance by the project with the long-term requirement contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;960.5 of the proposed rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Include a summary in chart form showing all AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications received by the Bank in the particular AHP funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle, with the score each application received for each scoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion, and the total score received by each project; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Include any other information required by the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has general oversight responsibility over the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 10(j) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, section 10(j)(12)(A) of the Act requires the Board to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor and report annually to the Congress and the Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council for each Bank the support of low-income housing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development by the Banks and the utilization of advances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these purposes.

Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;1430(j)(12)(A). Since the Board would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer be receiving and approving AHP applications under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, the Board would no longer have these applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a source of data to assist the Board in exercising its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oversight and monitoring responsibilities and preparing the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to the Congress and the Advisory Councils. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board will need the Banks to provide this additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the Board in the summary, as required in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.7(b)(3).

1. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.8(a) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall evaluate the AHP applications received to determine if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the threshold criteria in proposed &sect;960.9. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications that meet the threshold criteria shall be scored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the criteria contained in proposed &sect;960.10 as set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in the Bank's approved AHP implementation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.8(b) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall approve the applications in descending order starting with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the highest scoring application until the total AHP funding amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the particular funding cycle, except for any amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient to fund the next highest scoring project, has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated. The Bank also may approve the next four highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scoring applications as alternates and, within one year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval by the Bank, may fund such alternates if any previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed AHP funds become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Threshold Criteria for Approval of AHP Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.9 of the proposed rule provides that an AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application must meet all of the threshold criteria set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. through f. below in order to be considered for scoring under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;960.10 and for AHP funding approval. These criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed in detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Authorized and required uses requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application must indicate that the use of the subsidized advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or direct subsidy set forth in the AHP application for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed project will comply with the requirements for authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and required uses of such funds contained in proposed &sect;&sect;960.3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.4 and 960.5. See proposed &sect;960.9(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed provision is consistent with the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.5(a)(1) of the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.5(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fair housing law requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AHP application must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that the project sponsor will comply with any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair housing law requirements and must indicate how the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to affirmatively further compliance with such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. See proposed &sect;960.9(b).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed provision is consistent with the requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with fair housing laws contained in &sect;960.5(a)(2)(i) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board's existing AHP regulation, and the requirement under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing practice that applications indicate how the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to affirmatively further such compliance. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.5(a)(2)(i).

The twenty percent requirement and alternatives.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.9(c) of the proposed rule incorporates the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum subsidy limitation requirement and alternatives contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;960.9 of the Board's interim rule, with minor changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language and one substantive modification discussed below. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 960.9 (58 FR 17968 (April 7, 1993)). The 20 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement and the alternatives discussed below implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum subsidy limitation requirement contained in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10(j)(9)(F) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(F). Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 percent requirement or an alternative must be satisfied by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP applications to avoid over-subsidization of a project, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth as a threshold requirement in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The twenty percent requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.9(c)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a Bank shall not offer subsidized advances or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidies to applicants in excess of that amount needed to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the monthly housing costs for income-eligible households, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's gross monthly income (the 20 percent requirement). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects where other forms of federal, state, local or private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized assistance are being used in conjunction with AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized advances or direct subsidies, the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized assistance, including funds provided under the AHP, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall not be in excess of the amount needed to reduce the monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing costs for the income-eligible households, as committed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the household's gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monthly housing costs are defined in proposed &sect;960.9(c)(1)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For households in AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, mortgage principal and interest payments, real property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxes, homeowners' insurance, a reasonable estimate of utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs excluding telephone service, and for households in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted condominium, cooperative, mutual housing or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing projects involving common ownership, those portions of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular operating assessment or fee allocated for principal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest payments, taxes, insurance and a reasonable estimate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilities attributable to the household's share of the common area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or the individual unit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) For households in AHP-assisted rental housing units, rent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments, and where they are not already included in rent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments, a reasonable estimate of utility costs excluding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.9(c)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household subject to the 20 percent requirement is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet such requirement only at the time it initially purchases or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupies a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Alternative requirements. Section 960.9(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the 20 percent requirement
shall not apply where a Bank provides subsidized advances or direct subsidies to an applicant for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing project, which project also receives funds from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal or state rental housing program that requires qualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households to pay as rent a certain percentage of their monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income or a designated amount, provided that the household meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the housing payment requirements of the other program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.9(c)(2)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 20 percent requirement shall not apply where the total amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of AHP funds provided through a Bank subsidized advance or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy used to finance rehabilitation of a housing unit by a very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income household that already owns and occupies the housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit is $10,000 or less per such household. In addition, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.9(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the 20 percent requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall not apply where the total amount of AHP funds provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a Bank subsidized advance or direct subsidy used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finance the purchase of a housing unit by a very low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household is $5,000 or less per such household. This is a change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the interim rule which permits this alternative to the 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent requirement only for households that are above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold income level for very low-income households and at or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the income level to qualify as low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households. The Board did not intend to exclude very low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households from taking advantage of this alternative when it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted the interim rule. Accordingly, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.9(c)(2)(ii)(B) corrects this error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.9(c)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 percent requirement shall not apply where the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP funds provided through a Bank subsidized advance or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy used to finance rehabilitation or purchase of a housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit by a low- or moderate-income household is $5,000 or less per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.9(c)(2)(iv) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 percent requirement shall not apply where a Bank provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized advances or direct subsidies ultimately benefiting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household with an income at or below the level committed to in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP application, which is participating in a self-help, sweat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity or similar housing program. Under the proposed rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household is required to contribute its skilled or unskilled labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valued at a minimum of $2,000 per household. The household must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work cooperatively with others to construct or rehabilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing which the household or other program participants are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing or already own and occupy, and the program must involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision of the work performed by skilled builders or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project feasibility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The AHP application must indicate that the proposed project is feasible. This determination must be based on an analysis
of project sources and uses of funds, project multi-year operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pro formas for rental housing projects, projections of sales and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices for owner-occupied housing units, and local market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The analysis must show that the project is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially viable and likely to be completed within a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time, and is likely to operate or sell and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordable to the designated income-eligible households over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term period committed to in the AHP application. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;960.9(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A feasibility requirement also is contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.5(a)(2)(ii) of the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifications of sponsor.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The AHP application must indicate that the sponsor has the qualifications and ability to perform its responsibilities
as committed to in the AHP application. See proposed &sect;960.9(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed provision is not included as a threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation, although it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under the regulation to be included by an applicant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its AHP application. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(4). The Board believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this provision should be included as a threshold requirement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since a project should not be funded if the sponsor lacks the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications and ability to undertake the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Creditworthiness of applicant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consistent with the Board's existing AHP regulation, &sect;960.9(f) of the proposed rule provides that the applicant
must have the ability to qualify for an advance from the Bank to fund the project described in the AHP application. See
12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(iii).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's existing AHP regulation also includes as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold requirement the ability of the project to begin using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank assistance within 12 months. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this involves the use of funds after a project has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for funding, it does not belong as a threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement and has been omitted in this section of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. The requirements under the proposed rule for use of funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the AHP within a reasonable period of time after approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application are discussed below in the use and verification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it has been suggested that a threshold criterion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be added requiring that the project costs set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP application are reasonable and appropriate for the type and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of the housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(j)(9)(F) of the Act requires the Board to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum subsidy limitations under the AHP. 12 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1430(j)(9)(F). Section 10(j)(9)(D) of the Act also requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board to ensure that a preponderance of assistance provided under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP is ultimately received by low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 1430(j)(9)(D). Requiring that project costs be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable is one way of controlling the amount of AHP subsidies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that fund a project in order to keep the project from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over-subsidized, and to ensure that a preponderance of the funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are being received by the ultimate households by lowering their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing costs and not providing undue benefit to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries in the development process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A project costs requirement is not explicitly prescribed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold requirements under the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although some Banks do currently review project costs to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they are reasonable under the feasibility requirement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulation. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(ii). The feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement as defined in the proposed rule would not incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a project costs limit requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board specifically requests comments on how the Banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently deal with applications with excessive project costs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the project costs option discussed above should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required as a threshold criterion in approving AHP applications, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and how such a requirement could be implemented by the Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Scoring of AHP Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.10(a) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall score AHP applications that satisfy all of the threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria in proposed &sect;960.9 according to the scoring methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in proposed &sect;960.10, which shall be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's approved AHP implementation plan. Section 960.10 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule modifies the existing scoring methodology, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board specifically requests comments on this proposed new scoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Priority treatment and scoring. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.10(b) of the proposed rule provides that each application is first evaluated to determine if it will receive
priority treatment. The Board's existing AHP regulation contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven priorities: Homeownership projects; rental projects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects using government properties; projects with a non-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or public agency sponsor; projects promoting empowerment; homeless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing projects; and projects meeting a Bank priority. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing AHP regulation, an application must meet at least three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the seven priorities to receive priority treatment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would contain only five priorities. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule would eliminate the priorities for homeownership and rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties because a project must be either a rental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homeownership project in order to qualify for AHP funding. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would replace the empowerment and homeless housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priorities with a priority for ``special needs'' housing. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the proposed rule would add a new priority for projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promoting economic mobility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;960.10(b) of the proposed rule, for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining priority, an application can receive a maximum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight points for each of the five priority categories described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. A Bank in its AHP implementation plan shall define more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically each of the five priority categories and explain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically how points will be awarded for satisfying each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category. An application will be deemed to meet a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority category if it is awarded at least four points for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority category. Applications meeting at least two priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories shall receive priority treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.10(c) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications that qualify for such priority treatment shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scored before applications that do not qualify for priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment. The applications that do not qualify for priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment will not be scored unless there are insufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority treatment applications to utilize the total AHP funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount for the funding cycle. Under the proposed rule, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points available for the priorities would be increased from 25 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. Section 960.10(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall total the points received by each applicant for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining priority for all of the five priority categories and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall award 40 points to the application(s) that receive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest number of total points, and the remaining application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scores shall be adjusted and awarded points on a declining scale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five priority categories are set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Government-owned properties. Applications for projects that finance the purchase or rehabilitation of housing
owned or held by the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality of the United States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including but not limited to HUD, the RTC, Farmers Home Administration, Veterans Administration, Federal National
Mortgage Association, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. (See proposed &sect;960.10(d)(1).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In defining the special needs priority in its AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan, a Bank is not required to include all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special needs listed as examples above. Rather, a Bank may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selective in giving priority to some special needs and not others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in devising its scoring system. In addition, the Bank may select 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other special needs not listed as examples above if the special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs chosen are similar in nature to such examples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) District Bank priority. Applications for projects that meet one or more priorities recommended by the Bank's
Advisory Council and adopted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's board of directors that each address a housing need in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's district and are consistent with the purposes of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank shall describe in its AHP implementation plan how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points for the priority or priorities will be distributed. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;960.10(d)(4).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Economic mobility priority. Applications for projects that provide housing for low- or moderate-income households
that move from low- or moderate-income neighborhoods or housing projects to neighborhoods, mixed-income buildings
or owner-occupied housing developments in which at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 percent of the households have incomes above the median income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the area, as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Urban Development. (See proposed &sect;960.10(d)(5).)

Scoring for objectives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's existing AHP regulation contains the following ``objectives'' scoring criteria: Targeting; long-term
retention; effectiveness; community involvement; community stability; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovation. The proposed rule makes long-term retention a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold criteria and adds a new objective called ``applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation.'' A description of this new objective and the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria are set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scoring for targeting objective. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.10(e) of the proposed rule provides that an application can receive a maximum of 20 points for the targeting
objective category. This is an increase from 15 points under the existing regulation. The proposed rule provides
that the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall award points to applications based on the extent to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project(s) serve(s) the greatest percentage of very low-, low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and moderate-income households, in that priority order. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative, if a weighted-average scoring methodology is provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, the Bank shall award points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an application based on the extent to which the project has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowest weighted-average income determined by multiplying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of units reserved for households at certain income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels by those incomes expressed as a percentage of median 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income, and adding the totals. Applications shall be scored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to each other with the maximum number of points allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awarded to the application(s) that best achieve(s) the targeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and awarded points on a declining scale basis. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as one group and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group.

Scoring for other objectives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.10(f) of the proposed rule sets forth five other objectives categories for scoring AHP applications.
The proposed rule requires the Bank in its AHP implementation plan to define more specifically each of the five other
objectives categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for satisfying each category. For each
category, the Bank shall award the maximum number of points allowable for such category to the application(s) that
best achieve(s) the objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted and awarded points on a declining
scale basis. The five other objectives categories are set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) AHP subsidy per unit. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award points
to applications based on the extent to which the project proposes to use the least amount of AHP subsidy per AHP-subsidized
unit. Projects should be scored relative to each other; however, owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored
as one group and rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group. This scoring criterion may not include
a leveraging criterion whereby the application is scored based on the percentage of the project's total development
cost that is to be financed with the AHP subsidy. This replaces the effectiveness criterion that can receive a maximum
of 15 points in the existing scoring methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applicant participation. An application can receive a maximum of five points for this category. The Bank shall
award points to applications based on the extent to which the project involves participation by applicants other
than the receipt of a subsidized advance or direct subsidy under the AHP. Such participation can be financial or non-financial,
including but not limited to debt or equity financing of the project, grants to the project, applicant involvement
on the boards of nonprofit sponsors, and applicant provision of technical assistance to the nonprofit sponsors for
the project. This is a new scoring criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Community involvement. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award
points to applications based on the extent to which there is demonstrated support for the project by local community
organizations and individuals other than as project sponsors, such as through the commitment by such organizations
and individuals of funds, goods and services, and volunteer labor. The Banks should not award points for this category
based solely on the number of letters of support received for the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Community stability. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award
points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s) maximize(s) community stability, such as by: committing
to maintain a greater long-term period pursuant to &sect;960.5; revitalizing vacant or abandoned properties or
being integrally part of a neighborhood stabilization plan, if such revitalization or stabilization is not identified
as a special needs category by the Bank pursuant to &sect;960.10(d)(3)(iii); and not displacing low- or moderate-income
households, or if such displacement will occur, indicating how such households will be assisted to minimize the impact
of such displacement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Innovation. An application can receive a maximum of five points for this category. This is a reduction from 10 points
under the existing regulation. The Bank shall award points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s)
involve(s) a particularly new or unusual approach, either financial or non-financial, for meeting the requirements
of this part.

G. Modifications of Approved AHP Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.11(a) of the proposed rule provides that an applicant that seeks a modification of an approved AHP application
before completion and occupancy of the project must submit a request for such modification in writing to the Bank for
review and approval. A modification is any change that affects or could potentially affect the material facts under
which the application was originally evaluated and scored. Modifications are changes in the specifics of an application
such as requests for additional AHP subsidy or changes in approved income targeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.11(b) of the proposed rule provides that a request for a modification of an approved AHP application must
include, at a minimum:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A description of how the proposed modification differs from the original application; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The reason for the proposed modification; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Any other information that the Bank determines is necessary to review the proposed modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.11(c)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall review the request for modification, shall
re-score the application as proposed to be modified according to the scoring criteria used in the AHP funding cycle
in which the application was originally approved, and may approve such request if the following factors are satisfied:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The project as proposed to be modified continues to meet all of the requirements of this part; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The project as proposed to be modified continues to score high enough that it would have been approved in its AHP funding
cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.11(c)(2) of the proposed rule provides that if the application does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph
(c)(1), the Bank in its discretion may approve the request for modification if the reason for the modification is due
to circumstances outside the control of the applicant or sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.11(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall forward to the Board a detailed summary of any modification
of an AHP application approved by the Bank, including how the Bank re-scored the project, within 30 calendar days of
the approval of such modification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Use, Calculation and Verification at Initial Disbursement of AHP Subsidized Advances or Direct Subsidies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Use of Subsidized Advances or Direct Subsidies Within Reasonable Period of Time and Verification of Reasonable
Progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the threshold requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the project have the ability
to begin using Bank assistance within 12 months is omitted as a threshold requirement in the proposed rule. See 12 CFR
960.5(a)(2)(iv). In addition, setting a fixed period of 12 months may not be appropriate in all cases, because what
is a reasonable period of time will vary from project to project depending on the type of project and the circumstances
of the project. However, the Board does believe that funds received under the AHP should be used within a reasonable
period of time after approval of an AHP application. Because what is a reasonable period of time is so project specific,
the Board believes that the determination of such periods should be left to the discretion of the Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;960.12(a) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall in its AHP implementation plan identify
what constitutes reasonable progress by the sponsor towards using subsidized advances or direct subsidies within
a reasonable period of time after the approval of an AHP application for different types of projects, and explain how
it intends to verify such reasonable progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.12(b) of the proposed rule provides that the sponsor must demonstrate that reasonable progress is being
made towards using the requested funds within a reasonable period of time after approval of the AHP application, as
determined by the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.12(c) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall verify the efforts of the sponsor to determine
whether it has satisfied the requirement in paragraph (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.12(d) of the proposed rule provides that if the sponsor fails to satisfy the requirement in paragraph
(b), the Bank shall cancel the AHP award, and shall not disburse any subsidized advances or direct subsidies through
the applicant to the sponsor, and the full amount of any previously disbursed subsidized advances or direct subsidies
shall be returned to the Bank.

2. Calculation of AHP Subsidy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is considering adopting rules on the calculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP subsidies for subsidized advances and specifically requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on the following proposals. Under consideration is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether AHP application approvals should commit to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amount of subsidy, or should commit to make a subsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance at a specific interest rate. Another possibility is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank can select on a case-by-case basis to do one or the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or both but the choice must be specified in its approval. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule could require the Bank's AHP implementation plan to describe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank's procedures in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board specifically requests comments as to whether an AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval should commit to provide a specific dollar amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy for a subsidized advance. If interest rates rise after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approval, should the interest rate on the subsidized advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be increased so that the present value of the amount needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidize the reduction in interest rate is equal to the subsidy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount originally approved? Should the applicant be given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of either reducing the principal amount of the loan and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keeping the originally requested interest rate unchanged, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the interest rate on the loan and keeping the principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the loan unchanged? If interest rates fall after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval, should the specific dollar amount of approved subsidy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stay the same, or be adjusted? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, if the AHP approval commits to make a subsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan at a specified interest rate, then a number of issues are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised. First, should the amount of the subsidy to be charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the AHP fund be calculated at the time the application is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved, or at the time of disbursement. If the calculation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not done at the time the application is approved but is done at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time of funding and interest rates have fallen since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval, the amount of the subsidy provided to subsidize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance would decrease and the amount of subsidy charged against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP fund would decrease. If the calculation is done at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of funding and interest rates have risen since the approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of the subsidy provided to subsidize the advance would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase and the amount of subsidy charged against the AHP fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would increase. If the increase in subsidy is permitted to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged against the AHP fund, should there be any limits on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of increase in subsidy? If the amount that could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged against the AHP fund could be increased without limit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these charges could reduce the amount of funds available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future cycles of AHP funding. One option would be to put an upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, for example a specified number of basis points, as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum amount by which additional AHP funds would be provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover the interest rate increase. Another option would be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the amount of the subsidy as well as the interest rate on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the advance at the time the advance is approved and permit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy to be increased up to a specified amount. Another issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is whether funds from future AHP funding cycles should be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay for increased subsidies due to interest rate increases. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board specifically requests comments on these options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is concerned about the calculation of subsidies where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-amortizing subsidized advances are used by members to fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amortizing AHP loans from members to sponsors. Since principal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaid on a different schedule for amortizing loans than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-amortizing loans, the Banks must adjust their subsidy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation methodologies to ensure that they have properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted for these differences. As AHP principal is repaid to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member but not repaid to the Bank, the benefit of these subsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds may not be passed on to the ultimate borrower, as required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without proper adjustment for differences in the cash flows for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amortizing loan and an interest-only advance, the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy actually received by a project will be less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount incurred by the Bank as an AHP expense. The Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requests comments as to whether an amortizing advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure is required to assure that the subsidy amount incurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Bank as an AHP expense matches the amount of the subsidy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually received by a sponsor. In addition, the Board requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments as to whether there are alternative appropriate methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to deal with the discrepancy in the subsidy amounts where such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advances are used to fund amortizing loans.

Section 960.13 of the proposed rule provides that at the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of initial disbursement of a subsidized advance or a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy by a Bank for an approved AHP application, the Bank shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify in writing that the project complies with all applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements contained in proposed &sect;960.9 and all obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the approved AHP application. The Bank shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify the amount of subsidy being provided in connection with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application and being charged against the AHP fund. The Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall include in its AHP implementation plan its verification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for such purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.14 of the proposed rule sets forth the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for monitoring AHP-assisted housing projects. Section 960.14 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to implement the statutory requirement of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10(j)(9)(C) of the Act, which provides that the Board's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations shall ensure that advances made under the AHP be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to assist projects for which adequate long-term monitoring is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that each Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must monitor housing projects funded through its AHP. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.7(b). Section 960.14(a) of the proposed rule carries forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement, and &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sets forth the specific monitoring requirements for the Banks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are discussed further below. Section 960.14(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule provides that each Bank shall include in its AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan an explanation of how it intends to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements of &sect;960.14 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;960.14(c) of the proposed rule, a Bank may contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an applicant, a state housing finance agency, or another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity to perform the tasks required to carry out the Bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring responsibilities; however, the Bank remains ultimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for meeting the monitoring requirements set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.14 (e) through (h) of the proposed rule. Thus, a Bank may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide in its monitoring plan that applicants will have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term monitoring responsibilities. Alternatively, the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may decide to require applicants to perform long-term monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a condition of approval of an AHP award, or the Bank may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine what entity has the responsibility for monitoring on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project-by-project basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant Monitoring of Construction or Rehabilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.14(d) of the proposed rule adds a new requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if a subsidized advance or direct subsidy is used to finance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction or rehabilitation of a project, the Bank shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the applicant to monitor the construction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation until completion, and to make progress reports to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank. Where an applicant finances construction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation, the applicant usually monitors the progress of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project in connection with approving disbursements of funds to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower. Therefore, the Board believes that where an applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses a subsidized advance or direct subsidy to make loans for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted project, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant is in the best position to monitor the progress of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction or rehabilitation and to make progress reports to the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.14 (e) through (h) of the proposed rule sets forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specific aspects of an AHP project that a Bank is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor. Section 960.14(e) of the proposed rule sets for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring responsibilities that are long-term in nature, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by section 10(j)(9)(C) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1430(j)(9)(C). Section 960.14(f) and (h) of the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sets forth the short-term monitoring responsibilities for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the special needs and economic mobility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priorities. Section 960.14(g) sets forth the monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities for the District Bank priority or priorities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may or may not be long-term, depending on the nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority selected by the Bank.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(e) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for monitoring the long-term requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied and rental housing projects assisted under the AHP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Owner-occupied housing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(e)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides that at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time a household enters into a purchase contract for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted housing unit or by the closing on the financing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such unit, or at the time a household that already owns the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing unit receives a commitment of a loan or a grant pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the AHP, the Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the sponsor that the household has an income at or below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level committed to in the AHP application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the required long-term period applicable to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP, the Bank or its designee shall monitor the unit to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it has been sold to a household with an income that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the level committed to in the AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board requests comments on two proposed options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing this requirement. These options incorporate the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sampling to monitor AHP-assisted projects. The Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that as the number of AHP-assisted projects in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence grows, the costs of monitoring these projects may place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an undue financial burden on the Banks and the AHP. Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted projects on a sample basis may be one way to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the costs of monitoring while continuing to meet the monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of relevant reports or certifications obtained from the sponsor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including any reports or certifications received pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.15(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule and, at least on a sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, periodic review of land title records at intervals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Bank, based on the amount of funds received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project pursuant to the AHP, the type and complexity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project, or other factors deemed relevant by the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative option would be to require that the Bank only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to review land title records on a sample basis, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Rental housing projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank shall require an AHP-assisted rental housing project to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a deed restriction or other legally enforceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism which requires that upon sale of the project prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by households with incomes at or below the level committed to in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP application, the Bank or its designee must receive notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the sale, and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The project's rental units, or portion thereof, must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be affordable for and occupied by households with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the remainder of the long-term period committed to in the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, and the purchaser agrees to be subject to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions on resale that applied to the seller; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the seller must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay a pro rata portion of the grant to the applicant, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in &sect;960.16(d)(1) of the proposed rule; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seller, then the provisions of &sect;960.16(d)(2) shall apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing project or one year after initial disbursement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized advance or direct subsidy, whichever occurs first, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the owner that the project's units, or portion thereof, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupancy at or below the levels committed to in the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the long-term period for which the units, or portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereof, of a rental housing project must remain affordable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall monitor the project to determine whether the project's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, or portion thereof, remain affordable for and occupied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP application. The Board requests comments on several options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for implementing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of relevant household income and rent reports or certifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the sponsor or the owner and, at least on a sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, periodic inspections of the project at intervals to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Bank, based on the amount of AHP assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the project, the type and complexity of the project, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other factors deemed relevant by the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another option would be that where funds other than funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided under the AHP are the predominant source of financing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an AHP-assisted rental housing project and the monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities of such other funding source are sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the project's compliance with the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP, as committed to in the AHP application, the monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement would be deemed to be fulfilled. However, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring activities of such other funding source are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to determine the project's compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the AHP, as committed to in the AHP application, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank would be required to monitor the project by conducting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections, at least on a sample basis, as determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank, based on the amount of the funds received by the project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the AHP, the type and complexity of the project, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors deemed relevant by the Bank. In the alternative, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring activities of such other funding source are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to determine the project's compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the AHP, as committed to in the AHP application, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could the Bank rely on monitoring activities of the predominant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding source as long as it is monitoring for compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that are substantially similar to the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board specifically requests comments on how random sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be used to monitor AHP-assisted rental housing projects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether, during the long-term period committed to in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP application, the project's units continue to be affordable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application. For example, sampling could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve monitoring a portion of AHP-assisted rental projects at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed intervals. The sampling method could be devised so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each project is monitored at least once during the long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period committed to in the AHP application. Alternatively, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling method might be structured so that some, but not all, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted rental projects are monitored during the long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period committed to in the AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that the AHP regulation must ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP will be used only to assist projects for which adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term monitoring is available to guarantee that affordability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and other requirements of the Act are satisfied. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(C). The Board requests comments as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it is appropriate to interpret this requirement in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner that permits monitoring to be done by sampling that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in some AHP-assisted rental projects not being monitored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the long-term period committed to in the AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Board specifically requests comments on whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are sampling techniques that would ensure that each project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is monitored in satisfaction of the monitoring requirement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act.

Monitoring of special needs projects.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(f) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for monitoring a project that commits to meet a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special need pursuant to proposed &sect;960.10(d)(3), either through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing units for persons with a special need or through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing a special service to occupants, as defined in the Bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP implementation plan. If an applicant commits to fund a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project that provides owner-occupied or rental housing units for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons with a special need, as defined in the Bank's AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan, &sect;960.14(f)(1) of the proposed rule requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank or its designee to obtain a certification from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor or the owner upon completion and occupancy of the project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the project's units, or portion thereof, are occupied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons with such special need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project that will provide a continuing special service to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupants, as defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as child care, job training, medical care, or other services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to meet the special needs of occupants, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.14(f)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank or its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor or owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon completion and occupancy of the project that the special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service is being provided to the occupants, as committed to in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.14(f)(2) of the proposed rule provides that, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project that will provide a continuing special service, the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or its designee shall monitor the project, as determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank in its AHP implementation plan, for at least one year from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date of initial full occupancy of the project to verify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the special service continues to be provided to the occupants, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application.

full occupancy of the project, as required under &sect;960.15(c)(4), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the sponsor or the owner has met such requirements, as

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.15 of the proposed rule sets forth the reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the Banks, the applicants, and the sponsors or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners of AHP-assisted projects. Section 960.15(a) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule provides that each Bank shall provide accurate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely reports and documentation to, and in the format requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by, the Board concerning the Bank's AHP, as the Board may from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to time require. See 12 CFR 960.6(a).

1. Applicant Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.15(b)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall require an applicant receiving a subsidized advance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct subsidy to report at least annually to the Bank on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner in which it has used the funds, with such reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing until the funds have been fully disbursed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant. See 12 CFR 960.6(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule eliminates the requirement in the Board's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing AHP regulation that the applicant certify that the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy has been passed through to the borrower and continues to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used for approved purposes because, as discussed previously in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section on monitoring requirements, under the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants are not required to monitor the use of a subsidy in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted projects, except during the period when a subsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance or direct subsidy is used to finance construction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation of a project or where the applicant has agreed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertake monitoring. See 12 CFR 960.6(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.15(b)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that if subsidized advances or direct subsidies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to finance construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project, the Bank shall require the applicant to report to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank at reasonable intervals determined by the Bank, and described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, on the progress of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction or rehabilitation, until completion. This reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement coincides with the requirement in &sect;960.14(d) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule that the Bank shall require the applicant to monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted project and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Sponsor and Owner Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.15(c) of the proposed rule sets forth the reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for sponsors and owners. These requirements coincide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the monitoring requirements set forth in &sect;960.14(e) through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) of the proposed rule. Section 960.15(c)(1)(i) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule provides that where a subsidized advance or direct subsidy is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to finance the purchase of an owner-occupied housing unit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank shall require the sponsor to certify at the time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household enters into a purchase contract for such unit or at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing on the financing for such unit that the unit has been sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a household with an income at or below the level committed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the AHP application. Where a subsidized advance or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy is used to finance the rehabilitation of an owner-occupied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing unit, the Bank shall require the sponsor to certify at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time a loan or grant is committed to fund such rehabilitation that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household that owns and occupies the unit has an income at or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the level committed to in the AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.15(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP is not subject to a deed restriction or other legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of ownership to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household with an income at or below the level committed to in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP application, the Bank shall require the sponsor to report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank or its designee, at least annually for the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term period, the number of any such units that are sold to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households whose incomes exceed the level committed to in the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, and to certify to the Bank that it is continuing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy its commitment pursuant to its legally binding agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.15(c)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank shall require the sponsor or the owner to certify upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing project, but no later than one year after initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursement of the subsidized advance or direct subsidy, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annually thereafter, that the project's units, or portion thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the levels committed to in the AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.15(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a project that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will provide housing units for persons with a special need, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will provide a continuing special service to occupants pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.10(d)(3) of the proposed rule, the Bank shall require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor or the owner to certify upon completion and full occupancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the project that the project's units, or portion thereof, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied by persons with such special needs or that a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service is being provided to occupants, as committed to in the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.15(c)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a housing project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meets the requirements of the economic mobility priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;960.10(d)(5) of the proposed rule, the Bank shall require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sponsor or the owner to certify upon completion and full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupancy of the project that the sponsor or owner has met such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, as committed to in the AHP application.

Section 960.15(d) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank

K. Corrective and Remedial Actions for Fraud or Non-Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With AHP Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10(j) of the Act is silent on what specific corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and remedial actions should be imposed when there is fraud or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance with the requirements of the AHP. See 12 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1430(j). Accordingly, the Board has the discretion to determine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a matter of policy, what those requirements should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that, where funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided under the AHP will not be or are no longer being used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their approved purposes, the amount of committed but unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidy or improperly used subsidy shall be recovered and made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available by the Bank for future AHP projects. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.8(a). The existing regulation requires the Bank, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recapturing such funds, to take any or all of the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, without limitation on other remedies, in its discretion: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Reprice the advance at the interest rate charged to members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on non-subsidized advances of comparable type and maturity at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of the original advance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Call the advance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Assess a prepayment fee; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Require the member to reimburse the Bank for the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unused or improperly used subsidy on the advance or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;960.8(b). In addition, some Banks have adopted procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that require a direct subsidy to be converted to an advance if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project is found to be in non-compliance with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of concerns have been raised about this recapture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. First, it may not be equitable to require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant to reimburse the Bank when it is the sponsor that is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance with the AHP requirements. Second, requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recapture of the AHP subsidy could in some situations result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant having to foreclose against a property in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover the funds to repay an advance to the Bank, thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminating affordable housing units even when only a few of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units in the project may be out of compliance with AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, it has become clear through the operation of the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the recapture remedy may not be the appropriate remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action in all circumstances. Other less severe remedial actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be more appropriate depending on the nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance that has occurred. In addition, the remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions should be directed only at the parties that are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance. Accordingly, the proposed rule contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions that tailor the remedial actions required to the nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the non-compliance and the party committing the non-compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are discussed further below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Fraud or Willful Non-Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fraud and willful non-compliance are the most extreme examples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of non-compliance with the AHP requirements. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule applies the most severe remedial actions_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion or suspension from future participation in the AHP and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the full amount of the AHP subsidy_to parties that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have committed fraud or are in willful non-compliance with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the AHP requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, &sect;960.16(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the event of an applicant's, sponsor's or owner's fraud with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the AHP requirements, the Bank shall exclude the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant, sponsor or owner, respectively, on a permanent basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from future participation in the AHP. In the event of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant's, sponsor's or owner's willful non-compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP requirements, the Bank shall suspend the applicant, sponsor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner, respectively, at least on a temporary basis, from future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the AHP during the period such willful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance continues, and may exclude such party permanently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from future participation in the AHP. The Board specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments as to whether the Banks should be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether fraud or willful non-compliance has occurred, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether such determination should be made by the Board, or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the Bank or the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;960.16(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the event of an applicant's fraud or willful non-compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the AHP requirements, the Bank shall recover from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.16(a)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the sponsor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner by the applicant and returned to the Bank or, if previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the Bank from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor or owner. If efforts to recover the AHP subsidy from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor or owner are unsuccessful, the applicant shall not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for such funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to be able to implement this recapture requirement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant is required, under proposed &sect;960.16(a)(3)(ii), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have in place either:

(1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable

mechanism that permits it to recover these funds from the sponsor

recover these funds from the sponsor or owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.16(a)(4) of the proposed rule provides that the

remedial actions under this paragraph (a) upon written request by

2. Other Types of Non-Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-compliance by a party with the AHP requirements, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to inadvertent errors by such party or changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances that are outside such party's control, does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant imposition of the most severe remedial actions since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party lacked the intent to violate such requirements. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, in many such cases, the non-compliance can be rectified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a reasonable period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;960.16(b) of the proposed rule provides that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the event of inadvertent non-compliance by an applicant, sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or owner, the Bank shall provide such party with a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time in which to take reasonable efforts, pursuant to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance plan approved by the Bank, to remedy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance. The Bank in its discretion may exclude such party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from participation in the AHP while it is under a compliance plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or in its discretion may require the applicant to increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term period committed to in its AHP application for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project by the amount of time the project has been in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.16(b) of the proposed rule further provides that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant, sponsor or owner takes no reasonable efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the compliance plan, then such party is in willful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance with the requirements of this part and is subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the remedial actions contained in paragraph (a) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. If the applicant, sponsor or owner takes reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts pursuant to the compliance plan to remedy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance under paragraph (b) and such efforts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsuccessful, the applicant, sponsor or owner would be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remedial actions for fraud or willful non-compliance, but may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to the Bank for a waiver of any such required remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. The Bank shall report to the Board in writing on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waivers approved pursuant to paragraph (b) within 30 calendar days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such approval.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.16(c) of the proposed rule provides generally that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the event that a household sells its AHP-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner-occupied housing unit to a household whose income exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the level committed to in the AHP application prior to the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required long-term period, then: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the seller to repay a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share, except for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
amounts, of the grant received by such seller. The amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be repaid shall be reduced for every year the seller owned the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit, to be repaid from any net gain from the sale of the unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after deduction for sales expenses, and to be returned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank. The proposed rule provides, however, that the Bank in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank in its AHP implementation plan; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then the applicant shall either repay to the Bank that portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the advance used to make the loan to the seller or the Bank shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convert that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seller to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidize that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seller shall be made available by the Bank for additional AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects.

Section 960.16(d) of the proposed rule provides that in the event that the owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing
project sells the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental units, or portion
thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in
the AHP application, and the purchaser does not agree to maintain the project according to such commitments and to
be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the seller, then:

any unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize the advance shall be made available by the Bank
for additional AHP projects.

L. AHP Applications Involving Loan Funds and Loan Consortia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.17 of the proposed rule sets forth specific requirements governing the use of loans and grants received
by loan funds and loan consortia pursuant to the AHP. The Board's existing AHP regulation does not address specifically
the use of loans or grants by loan funds or loan consortia pursuant to the AHP. See 12 CFR part 960. However, the Board
has adopted policy guidelines for the Banks governing the award of subsidized advances and direct subsidies to applicants
that then make loans or grants to loan funds and loan consortia (policy guidelines). See Board Resolution No. 93&hyph;54,
June 23, 1993. The provisions in &sect;960.17 of the proposed rule, if adopted in final form by the Board, would incorporate
the policy guidelines, with some modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides generally that an applicant may use a subsidized advance or a direct
subsidy to make a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan consortium. Section 960.17(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides
that AHP applications involving the use of loans or grants by loan funds or loan consortia are governed by the provisions
of part 960, except as provided in &sect;960.17 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(b) of the proposed rule provides that the requirements for approval of an AHP application that proposes
to use subsidized advances or direct subsidies to make a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan consortium are the same
as the requirements for approval applicable to all other AHP applications under &sect;960.8 of the proposed rule,
except that an AHP application that involves a loan fund or loan consortium will be scored on the criteria that the loan
fund or loan consortium proposes to use to select projects that will ultimately receive a loan or grant from the loan
fund or loan consortium that is subsidized by the AHP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is intended to address the fact that loan funds and loan consortia do not have specific proposed projects
in place at the time they apply for funds under the AHP. Section 960.17(b)(1) of the proposed rule therefore requires
the Banks to score AHP applications involving loan funds or loan consortia based on the criteria that the loan fund
or loan consortium commits to use when selecting the projects it will fund. This provision carries forward a requirement
of the Board's existing policy guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;960.17(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall review and shall require the applicant
to review each new rental housing project funded by a loan fund or loan consortium prior to disbursing a loan or grant
to ensure that the project meets the threshold requirements of &sect;960.9 of the proposed rule and the project selection
criteria committed to in the approved AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a change from the provision in the Board's existing policy guidelines that requires the Bank and the applicant
to review both rental and owner-occupied housing projects prior to funding by a loan fund or loan consortium under
the AHP. This change is intended to eliminate duplicative review of loan fund or loan consortium activities where
funds are used to finance owner-occupied housing units under the AHP. However, since rental housing projects are
more complex than owner-occupied housing projects, the Board believes that the applicant and the Bank should continue
to review each rental housing project funded by a loan fund or loan consortium prior to disbursement of any funds to
ensure that the project meets the feasibility, maximum subsidy, and other threshold requirements of &sect;960.9
of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(c)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the requirement in the Board's existing policy guidelines
that if an applicant receives a subsidized advance and uses the proceeds of the advance to make a loan to a loan fund or
loan consortium, the total value of the interest rate subsidy must be passed on to the borrower of the funds. Thus, &sect;960.17(c)(1)
provides that a loan fund or loan consortium shall extend credit to the borrower at a rate of interest equal to the rate
of interest charged on the subsidized advance plus a reasonable interest rate spread approved by the Bank. The applicant
and the loan fund or loan consortium may determine between themselves what proportion of the interest rate spread
the applicant and the loan fund or loan consortium will share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that a loan fund or loan consortium that receives a grant from
an applicant pursuant to the AHP must either:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Pass the entire grant on to the recipient; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Use the entire grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the borrower; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Lend the entire grant to the borrower to finance a rental housing project for a term of not less than 30 years, with
all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such term. If such loan is repaid before the end of the
30-year term, the entire amount of the grant must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn must forward the funds to
the Bank to be used for additional AHP projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a change from the provision in the Board's existing policy guidelines that prohibits a loan fund or loan consortium
from using a grant from an applicant to make a loan to the borrower. The Board believes that if a loan fund or loan consortium
lends a grant to a sponsor to finance rental housing units that will remain affordable for and occupied by income-eligible
households for not less than 30 years, with all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of the loan term,
then the loan fund or loan consortium has passed on the full amount of the AHP subsidy to the recipient or borrower of
the funds, as required by section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). However, if the borrower repays
the loan before maturity, the entire amount of the subsidy must be repaid to the applicant and forwarded by the applicant
to the Bank to be returned to the AHP fund. Therefore, a loan fund or loan consortium may use a grant under the AHP to make
a loan to the borrower under the conditions specified in &sect;960.17(c)(2)(i)(C) of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(c)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that if a loan fund or loan consortium provides both a loan
and a grant to the borrower and the loan fund or loan consortium charges an origination fee for providing the loan, then
any fee charged by the loan fund or loan consortium for providing the grant may not be paid with AHP subsidized advances
or direct subsidies. The Board does not believe that such funds should be used to pay a fee for providing a grant to a project
if the loan fund or loan consortium charges a fee for underwriting a loan to the same project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(c)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that when a loan fund or loan consortium receives a grant
from an applicant pursuant to the AHP and uses the grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the borrower, the interest
rate calculation must be consistent with the procedure used by the Bank for calculating the amount of AHP subsidy needed
for a subsidized advance, taking into account the source of funds used by the loan fund or loan consortium for its loans
and the rate that normally would be charged for a loan of the type and term that is provided to the borrower.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.17(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest or other income earned by a loan fund or loan consortium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a loan or a grant received from an applicant, other than any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved fee or interest rate spread charged to the borrower, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either (i) must be used by the loan fund or loan consortium to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide funds for additional projects meeting the threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in &sect;960.9 of the proposed rule and the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the approved AHP application, or (ii) must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forwarded to the applicant, which in turn must forward the funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Bank to be used for additional AHP projects. This is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change from the provision in the Board's existing policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines that allows loan funds and loan consortia to earn and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts of income on loans or grants received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from applicants. The Board believes that accounting for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts of interest or other income earned on loans or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants received from an applicant is no less of an administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden than accounting for all such interest or other income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earned. Therefore, the proposed rule requires all interest or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other income earned on loans or grants received from an applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used by the loan fund or loan consortium for additional AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects or returned to the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(c)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans or grants received by a loan fund or loan consortium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to one AHP funding cycle are combined with loans or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants received by such entity pursuant to another AHP funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle in a single rental housing project, the loan fund or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consortium shall require the recipient of the funds to follow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the use of such funds from the AHP funding cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is more restrictive as to the approved AHP criteria. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement does not apply when loans or grants received by a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund or loan consortium pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are combined to finance a single owner-occupied housing project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for this provision is that funds are more easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traceable to separate units in an owner-occupied housing project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than to separate units in a rental housing project. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of owner-occupied housing projects, it is possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use loans or grants from different AHP funding cycles according to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the different criteria approved by the Bank in each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respective funding cycles. However, the loan fund or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consortium in its discretion may require the recipient of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds to follow the requirements for the use of such funds from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP funding cycle that is more restrictive as to the approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(c)(5) of the proposed rule provides that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans provided by a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP that are repaid to such entity must be re-lent or provided as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants by such entity within a reasonable period of time after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such repayments, or must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must repay such funds to the Bank, and must be made available by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank for additional AHP projects. The Bank shall in its AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan identify what constitutes a reasonable period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time for such purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(d) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and reporting requirements where an applicant makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans or grants pursuant to the AHP to a loan fund or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consortium which uses the funds to finance owner-occupied or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing units. Section 960.17(d)(1)(i) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule requires the Bank to monitor such units, according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements of &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, to determine compliance with the long-term requirements, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as compliance with the special needs priority, the District 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank priority or priorities, and the economic mobility priority, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where applicable. In addition, &sect;960.17(d)(1)(ii) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule provides that the Bank shall require the sponsor or owner of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a project receiving a loan or grant from the loan fund or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consortium to submit to the Bank such reports and certifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as are required under &sect;960.15(c) of the proposed rule. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.17(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to report to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank any new loan or grant made using repayments of loans by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of such funds must be reported separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(d)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank may contract with either the applicant or the loan fund or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan consortium to meet the monitoring requirements of &sect;960.14(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through (h). Under &sect;960.17(d)(2)(i) of the proposed rule, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank contracts with the applicant to meet such monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, the Bank shall require the applicant to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank also shall require the applicant to require the sponsor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner of the project to submit to the applicant such reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications as are required under &sect;960.15(c) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. In addition, the applicant shall require the loan fund or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan consortium to report to the applicant any new loan or grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a loan fund or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan consortium receives loans or grants from an applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be reported separately.

Under &sect;960.17(d)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule, if the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts with the loan fund or loan consortium to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements in &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, the Bank shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank also shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund or loan consortium such reports and certifications as are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under &sect;960.15(c) of the proposed rule. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan fund or loan consortium shall report to the Bank any new loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or grant made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a

loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or grants from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds must be reported separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The monitoring and reporting requirements in &sect;960.17(d) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule are a change from the provisions on monitoring and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting in the Board's existing policy guidelines, which require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant to monitor the loan fund or loan consortium and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the Bank to monitor the applicant. This change is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to conform the monitoring and reporting requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects involving loan funds or loan consortia with the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to AHP-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing projects generally under &sect;&sect;960.14 and 960.15 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund or loan consortium receiving loans or grants from applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the AHP and the project sponsors and owners receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans or grants from loan funds or loan consortia are subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the corrective and remedial actions contained in &sect;960.16 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule for fraud and non-compliance with respect to the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the event of a loan fund's or loan consortium's fraud or willful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund or loan consortium by the applicant and returned to the Bank, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or if previously agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank from the loan fund or loan consortium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule requires an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant that provides a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consortium pursuant to the AHP to have in place either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism that permits the applicant to recover from the loan fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or loan consortium, in the event of fraud or willful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHP requirements, the full amount of the AHP subsidy; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant, and the loan fund or loan consortium, that permits the

Bank to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consortium with respect to the AHP requirements, the full amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the AHP subsidy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.17(e)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that

in the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered by the loan fund or

Section 960.17(e)(4) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedial actions for fraud or willful non-compliance with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the AHP requirements, upon written request by the Bank, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant, loan fund or loan consortium, sponsor or owner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
M. Required Annual AHP Contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.18 of the proposed rule requires each Bank to fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its AHP annually in accordance with the formula set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 10(j)(5) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(5). Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.18 is consistent with &sect;960.10 of the Board's existing AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, except for minor wording changes and deletion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language regarding required funding in 1990 through 1993 which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer necessary. See 12 CFR 960.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, proposed &sect;960.18 provides that each Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall fund its AHP in accordance with the following formula: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In 1994, the greater of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 6 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That Bank's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of an aggregate of $75 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In 1995 and each year thereafter, the greater of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 10 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That Bank's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
share of an aggregate of $100 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``net earnings of a Bank'' is defined in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.1. The definition has been revised from the definition in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more accurately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
track its definition in section 10(j)(8) of the Act. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.1(j); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(8).

N. Temporary Suspension of AHP Contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.19 of the proposed rule sets forth the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing temporary suspensions by Banks of their required annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP contributions. A number of revisions have been made to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section in the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately track the language in section 10(j)(6) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning this section and to provide greater clarity. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 960.11; 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.19(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank finds that the contributions required pursuant to proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.18 are contributing to the financial instability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank, the Bank shall notify the Board promptly, and may apply in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing to the Board for a temporary suspension of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.19(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's application for a temporary suspension of contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) State the period of time for which the Bank seeks a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) State the grounds for a suspension; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Include a plan for returning the Bank to a financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stable position; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Be accompanied by the Bank's preceding year's annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial report, if available, and the Bank's most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly and monthly financial statements and any other financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data the Bank wishes the Board to consider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement in paragraph (ii) above is not explicitly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.11(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (iv) above adds to the Board's existing regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Bank may include any other financial data it wishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board to consider.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.19(b)(1) of the proposed rule provides that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing a Bank's application for a temporary suspension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributions to determine the Bank's financial instability, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board shall consider the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether the Bank's earnings are severely depressed. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language was added to track the statutory standard in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10(j)(6) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board shall consider the extent to which the Bank's quarterly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual net earnings have decreased from the preceding quarter or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, and whether such decline is projected to continue; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether there has been a substantial decline in the Bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membership capital. The Board shall consider the extent to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank's paid-in membership capital has declined in any given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Whether there has been a substantial reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's advances outstanding. The Board shall consider the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which the Bank's level of advances has declined in any given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether any other financial condition exists with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Bank which has resulted in, or is likely to result in, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial instability of the Bank.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.19(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board shall disapprove an application for a temporary suspension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if it determines that the Bank's reduction in earnings is a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A change in the terms of advances (other than subsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advances) to members which is not justified by market conditions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Inordinate operating and administrative expenses; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Mismanagement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``reduction in earnings'' language replaces the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``financial instability'' used in the Board's existing regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the former is the term used in the Act. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.11(c); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the requirement in &sect;960.11(c)(5) of the Board's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulation that the Bank shall disapprove an application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if for any other reason the temporary suspension is not warranted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is deleted in the proposed rule because it is not required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, and limits the Board's discretion to balance reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranting approval of an application for a temporary suspension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See 12 CFR 960.11(c)(5); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.19(d)(2) of the proposed rule provides that during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term of a temporary suspension approved by the Board, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected Bank shall provide to the Board such financial reports as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board shall require to monitor the financial condition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank, and the Board shall continue to monitor the Bank's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition. The requirement that the Board shall monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's financial condition is added because it is required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6)(D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.19(d)(3) of the proposed rule provides that if, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the conclusion of the temporary suspension period, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board determines that the Bank has returned to a position of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial stability, the Board may, upon written notice to the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.19(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's board of directors determines that the Bank has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to, or is not likely to return to, a position of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial stability at the conclusion of the temporary suspension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the Bank may apply in writing for an extension of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary suspension period, stating the grounds for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;960.19(e)(2) provides that the Board shall approve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or disapprove a Bank's application for an extension of a temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension period within 30 calendar days of receipt of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;960.19(e)(3) provides that the Board's decision on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an application for an extension of a temporary suspension period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be in writing, shall be accompanied by specific findings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons for such action, and shall state the effective date and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time period if an extension is approved.

6. Notice to Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.19(f)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board shall notify the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate not less than 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar days before any temporary suspension (or extension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such suspension) approved pursuant to this section takes effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleted from this provision is the requirement in the Board's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulation that a copy of the Board's suspension decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be forwarded to the Congress since, as discussed above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act only requires that the Board provide notice to Congress of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension decision. See 12 CFR 960.11(f); 12 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1430(j)(6)(F). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;960.19(f)(2) provides that a temporary suspension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or extension of such suspension) shall become effective as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Board, unless a joint resolution of Congress is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted disapproving such suspension (or extension thereof). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule deletes the provision in the Board's existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation that a temporary suspension extension may not take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect until at least 30 days after the Board gives the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice to Congress, because this is inconsistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the existing regulation that the Board must notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Congress at least 60 days before such extension takes effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See 12 CFR 960.11(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;960.19(f)(2) also deletes from the Board's existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation the requirement that a joint resolution of Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disapproving a suspension or extension of a suspension must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted prior to the Board's determined effective date, in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to track more closely the actual language in the Act. See 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 1430(j)(6)(F).

O. Affordable Housing Reserve Fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.20(a) of the proposed rule provides that if a Bank fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use or commit the full amount of its required annual contribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the AHP, 90 percent of the amount that has not been used or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed in that year shall be deposited by the Bank in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affordable Housing Reserve Fund established and administered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board. See 12 CFR 960.12. The 10 percent of the unused and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncommitted amount retained by the Bank should be fully used or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed by the Bank during the following year, and any remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion must be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Bank is deemed to have used or committed its required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribution where amounts are remaining at the end of the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because funding the next highest ranking project would exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank's required AHP contribution for the year. Such amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining shall be combined with returned AHP funds to fund the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next highest scoring AHP project or projects, or carried over by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Bank to the next year's AHP funding cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language allowing these amounts to remain at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year is added in the proposed rule to take into account situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where amounts remain uncommitted at the end of the year because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the balance of required AHP contributions remaining is too small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to fund the Bank's next highest scoring AHP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last sentence in proposed paragraph (a) also is new, making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explicit that such amounts remaining and funds returned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank shall fund other AHP projects and need not be transferred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.20(b) of the proposed rule provides that by January 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 of each year, each Bank shall provide to the Board a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating the amount of unused and uncommitted funds from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior year, if any, which will be deposited in the Affordable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housing Reserve Fund.

how any Reserve Funds would be made available to the Banks, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleted in the proposed rule. See 12 CFR 960.12(d). The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that such provisions would be determined pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations issued by the Board. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(7). Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there currently are no Reserve Funds and it is not anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there will be any Reserve Funds in the near future, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary at this time to include provisions in the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dealing with this issue. The Board can issue regulations on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue at a future date if such eventuality should arise.

P. Advisory Councils 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.21 of the proposed rule sets forth provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing the appointment, operation, and responsibilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Councils to the Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(a)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall appoint an Advisory Council of seven to 15 persons who shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reside in the Bank's District and shall be drawn from community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nonprofit organizations actively involved in providing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promoting low- or moderate-income housing in the Bank's District. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See 12 CFR 960.14(a). In addition, &sect;960.21(a)(1) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule provides that the size of the Advisory Council shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in the Bank's AHP implementation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(a)(2) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must actively solicit nominations from Bank members and community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nonprofit organizations and shall allow sufficient time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response, so that the nomination and appointment process is as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad and as participatory as possible. See 12 CFR 960.14(b), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d). The Bank also should solicit nominations from any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties. In addition, &sect;960.21(a)(3) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule provides that Advisory Council members shall be appointed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Banks giving consideration to the size of the District and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diversity of low-income housing needs within the District. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that officials of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state and local housing finance agencies may serve as members of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Advisory Council, provided that such officials do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute an undue proportion of the membership of the Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council. See 12 CFR 960.14(c). It has been suggested that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials should only be able to serve as non-voting members of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council, unless the officials also are employed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with a private community or nonprofit organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actively involved in providing or promoting low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income housing in the Bank's District. This suggestion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on the view that the Advisory Councils are intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve as vehicles for private sector community and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, not public agencies, to advise the Banks on low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and moderate-income housing programs and needs in the District and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the utilization of Bank advances for such purposes. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(11). While acknowledging that officials of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state and local housing finance agencies make valuable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributions to the Advisory Councils, the supporters of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viewpoint argue that these agencies have opportunities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence the allocation of housing finance credit through means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than by voting representation on the Advisory Councils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board specifically requests comments on whether or not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials of state and local housing finance agencies should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to vote on the Advisory Councils and whether their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation should be limited so that it does not constitute an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undue proportion of the Advisory Council membership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council members shall serve for terms of two or three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, as determined by the Bank and set forth in its AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan. The Board is proposing to give the Banks the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of appointing Advisory Council members for three-year terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to allow the Banks to benefit from the experience and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiarity with the AHP that Advisory Council members develop the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer they serve on an Advisory Council. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council members shall be staggered to provide continuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and experience in service. See 12 CFR 960.14(f). The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule requires the Banks to explain in their AHP implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans how Advisory Council member terms will be staggered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule contains a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision limiting an Advisory Council member to six years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive service. The Bank may set its own limits on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive terms within the six-year limit. This provision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to ensure that the membership of the Advisory Councils 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the diverse and changing viewpoints of private sector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community and nonprofit organizations on the low-income housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and needs of the Bank Districts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.21(a)(5) of the proposed rule provides that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council member who, subsequent to appointment, is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer employed by or associated with a community or nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization actively involved in providing or promoting low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income housing in the Bank's District may continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve on the Advisory Council until the end of his or her term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowing the Advisory Council member to serve out the remainder of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her term promotes continuity in the collective experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Advisory Council. Further, the member may still have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant experience related to low-income housing needs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District, which may continue to benefit the Advisory Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Board recognizes that the Advisory Council member may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer represent the interests of the community and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector. Therefore, the Board specifically requests comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision of the proposed rule. The Board also specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether a member who is no longer employed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or associated with a community or nonprofit organization should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitled to vote on the Advisory Council if he or she becomes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state or local housing finance agency official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(b) of the proposed rule provides that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council shall elect from among its voting members a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chairperson and a vice chairperson. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(c) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of the Board's existing AHP regulation that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council shall designate a member, or request that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of the Bank's staff be designated, to act as secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Advisory Council. See 12 CFR 960.14(g). The secretary shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record and maintain the minutes of the meetings of the Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council, which shall contain, among other things, a record of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons present, a description of the matters discussed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations made. The person acting as secretary at a meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall certify to the accuracy of the minutes of that meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(d)(1) of the proposed rule adds a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that, prior to the approval of the Bank's proposed AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan by the Bank's board of directors, the Bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council shall review the proposed AHP implementation plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and provide its recommendations to the Bank's board of directors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the requirements of &sect;960.2(c) discussed above under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section on the adoption of the AHP implementation plan. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is intended to give the Advisory Councils a greater role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in advising the Banks on how AHP funds should be allocated to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the low-income housing needs in their Districts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(d)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that upon request of the Advisory Council, the Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall provide the Advisory Council with copies of any AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications from prior AHP funding cycles. The Board is aware 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some Banks have already adopted this practice. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is intended to aid the Advisory Council members in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating how the AHP application priorities and scoring criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of AHP funds among different types of housing projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, this requirement is subject to any limitations of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laws that may require the Bank to keep information in an AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application confidential. The Bank may require Advisory Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members to agree to keep all or parts of AHP applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidential. The Board specifically requests comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages and disadvantages of allowing Advisory Council members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to examine AHP applications received by the Bank in prior AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(e) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council shall meet with representatives of the board of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directors of the Bank at least quarterly to advise the Bank on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low- and moderate-income housing programs and needs in the Bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District and on the utilization of AHP subsidized advances and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct subsidies for these purposes. See 12 CFR 960.14(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 960.21(f) of the proposed rule requires each Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council to submit to the Board annually by March 1 its analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the low-income housing activity of its Bank. This is a change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the January 31 date in the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is intended to give the Advisory Councils sufficient time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the end of the year to compile and evaluate year-end data in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to prepare their reports to the Board. See 12 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.14(j).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.21(g)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall reimburse members of its Advisory Council for transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and subsistence expenses they incur for each day devoted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending quarterly meetings with representatives of the board of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directors of the Bank. See 12 CFR 960.14(e). Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
960.21(g)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new requirement that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank shall pay members of its Advisory Council a fee for each day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devoted to attending quarterly meetings with representatives of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the board of directors of the Bank. The Board is proposing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in light of the additional responsibility given to Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council members under the proposed rule to advise the Banks on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the AHP implementation plans. The Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requests comments as to whether the Banks should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to pay fees, and whether the amount to be paid should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in the final AHP rule so that a uniform fee is paid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all Advisory Council members, or whether the fees should be set by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the board of directors of each Bank.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 960.22 of the proposed rule provides that, if published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a final rule, this part shall become effective 30 days from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of this part, or portion thereof, may be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects approved for AHP funding prior to the effective date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule to the extent all relevant parties agree thereto in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing. The Finance Board would not need to approve any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retroactive application of the final rule. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is intended to allow the retroactive application to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing AHP projects of provisions of the revised AHP rule that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are less restrictive than existing AHP requirements, to the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all relevant parties (the Bank, the applicant, the sponsor, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner, and if applicable, the loan fund or loan consortium) agree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to such application of the new provisions. The Board specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on this proposed provision.

within the meaning of ``small entities,'' as defined in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). See 5 U.S.C. 601(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rental housing units. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) At least 20 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental housing units in a project financed under the AHP with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidized advances or direct subsidies shall remain affordable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for and occupied by very low-income households for a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of 30 years or, at the election of the sponsor, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining useful life of such units, except as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An applicant and the project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordability and income-targeting requirements contained in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(1). An applicant may commit to maintain additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units as affordable for and occupied by low- or moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households, which commitment shall be for a minimum period of 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years or, at the election of the sponsor, the remaining useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life of such units, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. The Bank's AHP implementation plan shall set forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that the Bank will follow to effectively implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this paragraph (a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A household occupying a rental housing unit subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required to satisfy the income-eligibility requirement of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph applicable to such income-targeted unit, as committed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the AHP application, upon initial occupancy. The household may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to occupy the income-targeted unit even if its income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases above the income-eligibility requirement for such unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unit may continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged remains affordable to the household as defined in &sect;960.1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, if the household's income rises above 140 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor must make the next available rental housing unit in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project affordable to and available for occupancy by a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose income is at or below the income-targeting level committed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to in the AHP application for the original unit, and once the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available rental housing unit is so occupied, the rent charged on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unit occupied by the household whose income has risen shall no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer be subject to the requirement that it be affordable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households at the income-targeting level committed to in the AHP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or below the levels committed to in the AHP application; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The purchaser must agree to continue the project's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to the seller; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfying each category. For each category, the Bank shall award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum number of points allowable for such category to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application(s) that best achieve(s) the objective, and the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall award points to applications based on the extent to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project proposes to use the least amount of AHP subsidy per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHP-subsidized unit. Projects should be scored relative to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other; however, owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one group and rental housing projects shall be scored as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate group. This scoring criterion may not include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leveraging criterion whereby the application is scored based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) A request for a modification of an approved AHP application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must include, at a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A description of how the proposed modification differs from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original application; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The reason for the proposed modification; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any other information that the Bank determines is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to review the proposed modification.

(c)(1) The Bank shall review the request for modification, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall re-score the application as proposed to be modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the scoring criteria used in the AHP funding cycle in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the application was originally approved, and may approve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such request if the following factors are satisfied: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The project as proposed to be modified continues to meet

cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the application does not satisfy the requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Bank in its discretion may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the request for modification if the reason for the

modification is due to circumstances outside the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant or sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Bank shall forward to the Board a detailed summary of

loan consortium, the loan fund or loan consortium must either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Pass the entire grant on to the recipient; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to the borrower; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Lend the entire grant to the borrower to finance a rental

housing project for a term of not less than 30 years, with all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such

term. If such loan is repaid before the end of the 30-year term, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the entire amount of the grant must be repaid to the applicant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which in turn must forward the funds to the Bank to be used for

 When a loan fund or loan

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedure used by the Bank for calculating the amount of AHP

Grounds for approval of application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In reviewing a Bank's application for a temporary suspension of contributions to determine the Bank's financial
instability, the Board shall consider the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether the Bank's earnings are severely depressed. The Board shall consider the extent to which the Bank's quarterly
or annual net earnings have decreased from the preceding quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to
continue; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether there has been a substantial decline in the Bank's membership capital. The Board shall consider the extent
to which the Bank's paid-in membership capital has declined in any given quarter or year, and whether such decline
is projected to continue; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Whether there has been a substantial reduction in the Bank's advances outstanding. The Board shall consider
the extent to which the Bank's level of advances has declined in any given quarter or year, and whether such decline
is projected to continue; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether any other financial condition exists with respect to the Bank which has resulted in, or is likely to result
in, the financial instability of the Bank.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board shall disapprove an application for a temporary suspension if it determines that the Bank's reduction in
earnings is a result of:

(i) A change in the terms of advances (other than subsidized advances) to members which is not justified by market conditions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Inordinate operating and administrative expenses; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Mismanagement.

must be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. A Bank is deemed to have used or committed its required contribution
where amounts are remaining at the end of the year because funding the next highest ranking project would exceed the
Bank's required AHP contribution for the year. Such amounts remaining shall be combined with returned AHP funds to
fund the next highest scoring AHP project or projects, or carried over by the Bank to the next year's AHP funding cycles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) By January 15 of each year, each Bank shall provide to the Board a statement indicating the amount of unused and uncommitted
funds from the prior year, if any, which will be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) By January 31 of each year, the Board will notify the Banks of the total amount of funds, if any, available in the Affordable
Housing Reserve Fund.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) intends to terminate existing waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for:
(1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy; (2) plate sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy; (3) wire,
nonelectrical, high nickel alloy; (4) bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass; (5) plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper-nickel, and copper; (6) sheet and plate aluminum products; and (7) structural shapes, angles, channels,
tees and zees, aluminum and high nickel alloy. SBA's intent to terminate these waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
is based on our recent discovery of small business manufacturers for these classes of products. Terminating these
waivers will require recipients of contracts set aside for small or 8(a) businesses to provide the products of small
business manufacturers or processors on such contracts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 100&hyph;656, enacted on November 15, 1988, incorporated into the Small Business Act the previously existing
regulation that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA 8(a) Program procurements
must provide the products of small business manufacturers or processors. The SBA regulations imposing this requirement
are found at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b). Section 210 of Public Law 101&hyph;574 further amended the law to allow
for waivers for classes of products for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors ``available
to participate in the Federal procurement market.'' The actions which the SBA is proposing to take with respect to
existing waivers and the reasons for those actions follow:

This notice requests that the public identify regulations that it believes should be amended or eliminated to reduce
undue regulatory burdens, if any, consistent with the FAA's statutory safety, security, and other public interest
responsibilities. This notice asks each commenter to identify, in order of priority, those regulations that are
believed to be unwarranted or inappropriate. In order to focus agency consideration, each commenter is asked to concentrate
on no more than three regulations he or she believes to be of primary concern. The agency asks further that each commenter
provide a brief explanation of: (1) The bases for the three highest priority recommendations to amend or eliminate
the regulations; (2) the ways in which each regulation's objective is otherwise fulfilled (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
by duplicative regulations or by technological advances that render the regulations obsolete); and (3) where appropriate,
a suggested substitute or amended version of the regulations identified. This information will help the FAA to respond
to the Administration's direction to design regulations in the most effective manner to achieve their regulatory
objective.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
With this Notice, the FAA is undertaking an evaluation aimed at eliminating or amending existing rules and regulations
that may not be necessary to achieve the agency's safety, security, and other public interest responsibilities.
This effort initiates a response to the recommendations of the 15-member National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive
Airline Industry, the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, and DOT and FAA regulatory
initiatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1993, the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (Commission) was established
by Public Law No. 103&hyph;13. The Commission was asked to investigate, study and make policy recommendations regarding
the financial vitality and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and aerospace industries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1993, the Commission issued a report to the President and Congress that addressed, among other things, the
legal and administrative policies that govern the regulatory responsibilities imposed on United States airlines.
The Commission found that Federal regulations impose a cumulative burden on airlines. While the FAA has not quantified
that burden, the Commission estimated that existing rules have added to airline costs and concluded that the costs
of these rules have a direct impact on the airlines' financial condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To enhance the FAA's ability to perform its statutory role without undue economic impact on the aviation industry,
the Commission recommends that the ``FAA/DOT undertake a short-range regulatory review_in close consultation
with industry and other interested parties_to eliminate or amend existing regulations to reduce regulatory burdens
consistent with safety and security considerations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Executive Order 12866 requires that agencies ``identify regulations that are cumulative, obsolete,
or inconsistent, and where appropriate, eliminate or modify them.'' In light of these concerns, and consistent with
the Administration's Civil Aviation Initiative, this notice solicits public comment that will assist the FAA in
focusing attention on areas where the public believes the regulatory burden is excessive and unjustified. In particular,
the agency requests that each commenter identify the most significant regulations that the commenter believes may
no longer be necessary, are unduly burdensome, or impose excessive costs or red tape. In some cases, for example, important
innovations, technologies, or new market opportunities may have taken place or may have been created since a rule
was promulgated, potentially rendering a rule obsolete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA requests commenters to focus their recommendations on up to three regulations they believe to be of primary
concern_rather than catalogue all rules that they may view to be objectionable in some respect. This will facilitate
development of a manageable overall proposal. Further, each commenter should rank 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in priority order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the regulations that the commenter believes the agency should address first. In addition, each submission should
include an explanation of: (1) How the identified regulatory requirement is burdensome; (2) how the requirement
should be changed or deleted, including, where possible, suggested draft substitutes; (3) how a regulatory change
would benefit the public; and (4) how a proposed regulatory change would provide an adequate level of safety, security,
or environmental protection. Specific economic information to support a reliable cost/benefit analysis of the
proposed change will also be of assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments in response to this notice are also expected to facilitate the FAA's regulatory review envisioned by Executive
Order No. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' issued September 30, 1993. This executive order requires each
agency to create a program under which it will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine
whether any should be modified or eliminated to make the agency's regulatory program more effective and less burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments provided in response to this notice will assist the agency in establishing its priorities for future
regulatory changes, including repeal or modification of rules where appropriate, to maintain safety and security
while reducing regulatory burdens.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 422 of 20 CFR provides information regarding the organization and procedures of the Social Security Administration
(SSA). Subpart C of part 422 describes the procedures of the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). Section 422.205
describes the organization and functions of the Appeals Council, a part of OHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By direct delegation of authority from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), the Appeals Council
is authorized to review hearing decisions and orders of dismissal issued by SSA's ALJs. Through the exercise of this
authority, the Appeals Council is responsible for ensuring that the final decisions of the Secretary involving benefits
under titles II, XI, XVI and XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) and part B of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety
and Health Act of 1977, as amended, are proper and in accordance with the law, regulations, and binding agency policy
established in Social Security Rulings and Acquiescence Rulings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 20 Appeals Council members, hereinafter referred to as either ``Administrative Appeals Judges (AAJs)''
or ``members,'' comprise the membership of the Appeals Council. The Associate Commissioner for OHA is the Chair of
the Appeals Council and is the administrative officer directly responsible to the Commissioner of Social Security
for carrying out OHA's mission of holding ALJ hearings and deciding appeals. Each AAJ, other than the Chair, is assisted
by an Appeals Officer who serves as a legal clerk. Organizationally, Appeals Officers are a part of the Appeals Council.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Appeals Council considers appeals under titles II, XI, XVI, and XVIII of the Act, and under part B of title IV of the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended. The regulations setting forth the responsibilities of the
Appeals Council appear in 20 CFR part 404 (subpart J, &sect;&sect;404.967 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), part 410 (subpart F, &sect;&sect;410.657 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), part 416 (subpart N, &sect;&sect;416.1467 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and 42 CFR part 405 (subpart G, &sect;&sect;405.701(c) and 405.724), part 417 (subpart Q, &sect;417.634 and part
473 (subpart B, &sect;&sect;473.46 and 473.48(b)). These regulations provide that after an ALJ has issued a decision
or dismissed a request for a hearing, the Appeals Council may review a case on its own motion or at the request of a party
to the hearing decision or dismissal. The Council may deny or dismiss a party's request for review, or it may grant the
request and either issue a decision or remand the case to an ALJ. If the Appeals Council denies a request for review of
a decision by an ALJ, the ALJ's decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary subject to judicial review under
the provisions of section 205(g) of the Act. If the Appeals Council grants a request for review and issues a decision,
that decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary subject to judicial review pursuant to section 205(g) of
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 404.970 and 416.1470 describe cases involving Social Security and supplemental security income benefits
payable under title II and title XVI of the Act that the Appeals Council will review. Those sections provide that the
Appeals Council will review a case if the action, findings or conclusions of the ALJ are not supported by substantial
evidence; there is an error of law; or there appears to be an abuse of discretion by the ALJ. Those sections also provide
that the Appeals Council will review a case that presents a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general
public interest. The same standards apply to determine if the Appeals Council will review a case under title XVIII
of the Act or under part B of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, there have been questions about the functions and operations of the Appeals Council. Some commenters
have questioned the usefulness of review by the Appeals Council. Several studies have addressed the role of the Appeals
Council, resulting in many recommendations for improving the Council's structure and operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its Recommendation 87&hyph;7: A New Role for the Social Security Appeals Council (adopted December 18, 1987),
the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) concluded that the high volume of work of the Council (up
to 500 cases per member per month) precluded it from detecting emerging problems, identifying new issues to be resolved,
and identifying and developing needed policies. ACUS recommended that the Secretary and SSA restructure the Appeals
Council in ``a fashion that redirects the institution's goals and operations from an exclusive focus on processing
the stream of individual cases and toward an emphasis on improved organizational effectiveness'' (1 CFR 305.87&hyph;7).
To this end, ACUS recommended that ``the Appeals Council should be provided the authority to reduce significantly
its caseload and also be given, as its principal mandate, the responsibility to recommend and, where appropriate,
develop and implement adjudicatory principles and decisional standards for the disability determination process.''
ACUS also recommended that the agency enhance the status of the Appeals Council and provide law clerks to its members.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the workload problems ACUS discussed in its recommendation, SSA decided, in 1988, to add Appeals Officers
to the Council to enable the members to focus their attention on the more complex and significant cases, including
those cases presenting important policy or procedural issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appeals Officers presently assist AAJs in considering recommendations made by the Council's support staff in OHA's
Office of Appellate Operations. Appeals Officers, who are attorneys, also act as the AAJs' staff attorneys, researching
and providing legal memoranda on issues arising from cases that come to the attention of the Appeals Council. However,
because the Appeals Officers do not have authority under our existing regulations to carry out any of the decision
making responsibilities of the AAJs, one or more AAJs must make these decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research we have supported since we established the Appeals Officer position has persuaded us that if the Appeals
Officers are authorized to assume some of the responsibilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAJs, the AAJs will be able to focus more of their attention on cases that present broad policy or procedural issues.
In a report commissioned by ACUS in 1989 (Report and Recommendations on the Social Security Administration's Administrative
Appeals Process), Professor Frank S. Block discussed the Appeals Council's workload and stated that the Council
could not be expected to assume a meaningful review function for all claims that might be presented to it. One of the
recommendations in the report was that the Appeals Council be authorized ``to use staff or lower level Council members
to deny a request for review, and limit the review of cases by the Appeals Council to those raising significant policy
issues.'' See Recommendation No. 12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To complete the changes we contemplated when we established the Appeals Officer position, we propose to amend &sect;422.205
to authorize Appeals Officers to deny a request for review of an ALJ hearing decision. Because an ALJ's dismissal of
a request for a hearing is not subject to judicial review, AAJs will continue to decide whether to grant or deny a request
for review of a hearing dismissal. Appeals Officers will continue to receive guidance, direction and supervision
from AAJs, including instructions as to specific issues or kinds of cases requiring the attention of the AAJ.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe this proposed change, which provides Appeals Officers a specific and limited authority, will improve
both the quality and efficiency of the service the Appeals Council is able to provide. The proposed change should allow
the Council to give the public a more timely response to their requests for review and increase the ability of the AAJs
to carry out their important function of providing review of many ALJ decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Appeals Officer under the proposed rule would have authority to deny a request for review of an ALJ decision,
he or she may also refer a particular case to an AAJ with a recommendation if it involves complex factual issues or complicated
interpretative issues of law and/or regulations. In addition, all cases in which an analyst in OHA's Office of Appellate
Operations prepares a recommendation to grant a request for review will be submitted directly to an AAJ for disposition.
We believe this process will serve two purposes: (1) It will expedite bringing the ``close cases,'' which are normally
more complex, to the AAJ's attention; and (2) it will allow the AAJs to focus on those cases raising significant issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to make this change in the regulation concerning the operating procedures of the Appeals Council under
the provisions of sections 205, 1102, and 1631 of the Act. These statutory sections give the Secretary broad regulatory
authority to establish procedures that are necessary and appropriate to carry out the Act's provisions.

Regulatory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule will enable the Appeals Officers to decide whether a request for review of an ALJ decision should
be denied, thereby making the decision of the ALJ the final decision of the Secretary for the purpose of any request
for judicial review which a party to the decision may decide to file under section 205(g) of the Act. The Appeals Officers
will not have authority to grant a request for review, to decide to review a case on the Appeals Council's own motion,
to remand a case to an ALJ, to grant or to deny a request to review a hearing dismissal, or to issue a final decision. The
authority to exercise those powers of the Council will remain exclusively with the AAJs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appeals Officers will be required to apply the same criteria as the AAJs in determining whether to deny a request for
review. The Appeals Officers will apply the provisions of &sect;&sect;404.970 and 416.1470, which specify when
the Appeals Council will review a case, in determining the appropriate action.

We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

a substantial number of small entities. Individuals are not included in the definition of a small entity. However,
for purposes of the RFA, we consider the majority of Medicare providers, physicians and suppliers to be small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inasmuch as the proposed rule does not alter the standards for Appeals Council review, we believe that it will have
little, if any, effect on providers, physicians and suppliers which request Appeals Council review of Medicare claims.
Accordingly, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule will not result in a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, we have not prepared an RFA analysis.

This document requests comments on a joint petition by HLG, Inc., licensee of Station WHLG(FM), Jensen Beach, Florida,
and City Broadcasting Co., Inc., license of Station WGGD(FM), Melbourne, Florida, proposing the substitution of
Channel 272C3 for Channel 272A at Jensen Beach, Florida, and modification of the license for Station WHLG(FM) to specify
the higher powered channel, and the substitution of Channel 236A for Channel 272A at Melbourne, Florida, and the modification
of Station WGGD(FM)'s license to specify the alternate Class A channel. Channel 272C3 can be allotted to Jensen Beach

The FHWA is proposing to remove obsolete and redundant regulations and appendices from the Federal Motor Carrier
Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). In addition, the FHWA is proposing minor technical changes in an effort to keep the FMCSRs
current. The removal of obsolete and redundant regulations and appendices is one of the first actions taken by the
FHWA following the Agency's Zero Base Regulatory Review public outreach sessions. The deletion of these regulations
should result in the reduction of the paperwork burden on the industry without any reduction in safety benefits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The primary focus of the FHWA's Motor Carrier Safety Program is to reduce commercial motor vehicle (CMV) accidents
and the attendant fatalities, injuries, and property losses. To remain effective, regulations must reflect trends
in State regulatory practices as well as technical and operational changes in the motor carrier industry. The motor
carrier safety regulations were initially promulgated and enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)
in 1937. In 1967 the Department of Transportation (DOT) was created by the Department of Transportation Act of 1966,
(Pub. L. 89&hyph;670, 80 Stat. 931) and the regulatory and enforcement authority for motor carrier safety was transferred
to the DOT. Today this authority is vested in the FHWA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, the FMCSRs have been modified incrementally, usually by addition of new provisions and often because
of congressional mandates. Some sections, however, no longer correspond to current practices in the motor carrier
industry, and others have been superseded by State or local initiatives. In September 1992, the Federal Highway Administration
began a comprehensive multi-year effort to re-create a body of safety rules and regulations that are (1) understandable,
(2) enforceable, (3) capable of being implemented by industry, and above all, (4) consistent with highway safety.
The effort has been termed ``Zero Base Regulatory Review.'' The review will not edit the current regulations, but
will start with the basic questions of who, what, and how do we regulate and what is essential to improve motor carrier
safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with the Zero Base effort, the FHWA participated in a governmentwide review of regulations designed to
identify regulations that were no longer required or unnecessarily hindered economic growth. The FHWA's proposed
deletions were incorporated into an NPRM published by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) on May 20,
1992 (57 FR 21362). On December 22, 1992, the OST published a final rule but declined to take final action on the FHWA
proposals. 57 FR 60725.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket comments submitted in response to the May 20 NPRM, and other comments received in conjunction with the FHWA's
Zero Base review effort, were evaluated by the FHWA in preparing the current NPRM. The FHWA has identified several
requirements that are obsolete or redundant, i.e., which are repeated by State law or covered in another part of the
FMCSRs or which could be reissued as non-regulatory guidance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The objectives of the FHWA's regulatory review were to (1) eliminate requirements not needed to carry out the regulatory
program; (2) ensure that rules are clear and succinct; (3) reduce lengthy and excessively detailed regulations whenever
possible; (4) eliminate redundancy; (5) eliminate excessive reporting requirements; and (6) reduce or eliminate
paperwork burdens wherever possible, without compromising safety.

Part 391_Qualifications of Drivers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The primary function of part 391 is to ensure that operators of CMVs meet minimum physical standards and possess the
knowledge, skills, and abilities to operate CMVs safely. The FHWA has reviewed the regulations in part 391 and has
determined that all requirements pertaining to the written examination and record of violations are unnecessary,
for the reasons set forth below.

Written examination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The written examination tests prospective drivers on the rules and requirements established by the FMCSRs. However,
the examination is an instructional tool only and a person's qualification is not affected by his or her performance
on the examination. Carriers are not obligated to take applicants' scores into consideration when making hiring
decisions, so the Federal requirement is of only marginal usefulness. Carriers may continue to give the test, but
the FHWA will no longer require them to do so. Moreover, drivers who are subject to the Commercial Driver's License
(CDL) requirements must pass a knowledge test to obtain a CDL, so for CDL holders the written exam is both redundant
and ineffectual. Therefore, the written examination (contained in appendix C) and all related qualification and
recordkeeping requirements would be removed. The sections to be removed or amended by this proposal include &sect;&sect;391.11(b)(11);
391.35; 391.37; 391.51(c)(5); 391.51(d)(3); 391.61; 391.67(a); 391.67(c); 391.69(b); 391.71(a) and appendix
C to subchapter B.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
List of violations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of the record of violations is to notify the employing motor carrier of all of a driver's moving violations
of motor vehicle traffic laws. This information is to be used by the carrier to ensure that its drivers have not been
disqualified to drive a CMV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CDL regulations require CMV drivers to notify their current employers within 30 days of any conviction for a non-parking
violation in any kind of vehicle (not only a CMV). If the conviction occurred in a jurisdiction other than the one that
issued the CDL, the driver must also report it to the issuing jurisdiction within 30 days (49 CFR 383.31). Therefore,
the provisions in &sect;391.27 for motor carriers to require their drivers to prepare and furnish a list of all traffic
violations during the preceding 12 months at least once every year, and to maintain the record of violations in driver
qualification files for three years, are unnecessary and redundant. Furthermore, it is a common practice for motor
carriers or their insurance providers to obtain from the State licensing agency the motor vehicle records on each
of their drivers once or more per year, although this is not required. The FHWA is therefore proposing to delete &sect;391.27
and all related qualification and recordkeeping requirements. The sections to be removed or amended by this proposal
include &sect;&sect;391.11(b)(8); 391.27; 391.51(b)(4); 391.51(h)(3); 391.63(a)(4); 391.67(a).

Miscellaneous.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA is also proposing minor technical corrections to &sect;391.51(b)(2) and &sect;391.51(g). These corrections
will bring the regulation into conformance with organizational changes of the regional offices of the Federal Highway
Administration, and will correctly identify the new title of the Regional Director of Motor Carriers.

The limited exemption in &sect;391.69(a) for drivers operating in the State of Hawaii is obsolete. Section 391.69(a)
states that ``drivers who will reach the age of 21 no later than April 1, 1976, may continue to drive within the State
of Hawaii.'' Since this date has passed, the provision should be removed.

Part 392_Driving of Motor Vehicles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has identified regulations within part 392, Driving of Motor Vehicles, that are redundant of State and local
laws. The regulations in part 392 are designed to reduce Commercial Motor Vehicle accidents by requiring that every
motor vehicle be operated in accordance with State and local laws and ordinances, or FHWA regulations, whichever
imposes the higher standard of care. The driving regulations and rules of the road in part 392 resemble traffic laws
and ordinances. Basic rules of the road for trucks and buses are more appropriately monitored and enforced by State
and local authorities under their own laws than by Federal regulators. In order to reduce duplication of enforcement
requirements, many of the rules contained in part 392 should be removed. The FHWA is proposing to remove the sections
discussed below:

Section 392.9a Corrective lenses to be worn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The FHWA is proposing to remove this section because it is duplicated by State driver licensing laws. State laws routinely
require drivers who need glasses or contact lenses to wear them while driving. In addition, the requirement that wearers
of contact lenses carry an extra set of them while driving does nothing to improve safety since a spare lens could not
be inserted before bringing the vehicle to a stop.

Section 392.21 Stopped vehicles not to interfere with other traffic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The FHWA is proposing to remove these sections because they are unenforceable by FHWA field staff and are more appropriately
addressed by State and local ordinances. In most, if not all, cases, State and local laws provide that drivers are required
to observe traffic signs. State and local enforcement officers are responsible for maintaining proper traffic flow
and handling slow moving and stepped vehicles.

The FHWA is proposing to remove &sect;&sect;392.61 and 392.69 because the FHWA believes that these situations should
be governed by company policy or a labor management agreement. Section 392.62 duplicates State and local regulations
and should be removed. Section 392.65 is proposed to be removed because it is obsolete. There are very few truck tractors
still in use that require entry into the sleeper berth from outside the vehicle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Part 396 places the responsibility upon the motor carrier to insure that its vehicles are properly maintained. The
FHWA is proposing to remove &sect;396.3(b)(4) because it is redundant. Section 396.3(b)(3) already requires motor
carriers to maintain for vehicles controlled for 30 consecutive days or more a record of inspection, repairs and maintenance
indicating their date and nature. Since the lubrication record required by &sect;396.3(b)(4) is a maintenance record,
the requirement is duplicative and should be removed.

Appendix A to subchapter B includes all interpretations that were issued by the FHWA up to the publication of a collection
of interpretations on November 23, 1977 (42 FR 60078). A new compilation of interpretations was recently published
in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

removed.

This proposed rule would remove obsolete and redundant regulations from the FMCSRs. The FHWA has determined that
this document is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or a significant regulation under
the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will
be minimal. Therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of
this proposal on small entities. This action would lessen the regulatory burden on small and large entities subject
to the FMCSRs by removing recordkeeping requirements associated with the written examination and record of violations.
Based on the evaluation of this proposal, the FHWA certifies that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The total amount of payments to State agencies for disbursement to Program sponsors will be based upon these Program
reimbursement rates and the number of meals of each type served. The above reimbursement rates, before being rounded-off
to the nearest quarter-cent, represent a 1.91 per cent increase during 1993 (from 141.5 in November 1992 to 144.2 in
November 1993) in the food away from home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. Because of the relatively small adjustment, the Department
points out that several of the new administrative rates are identical to the rates in effect for the 1993 Program.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 4, 1993, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 58839) the preliminary results of its 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93 administrative reviews of the antidumping
duty order on industrial belts from Japan (June 14, 1989, 54 FR 25314, amended August 4, 1989, 54 FR 32104). The Department
has now completed these reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).

Scope of the Reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured
or uncured, from Japan. These products include V-belts, synchronous belts, and other industrial belts, in part or
wholly of rubber or plastic, and containing textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord or strand, and
whether in endless (i.e., closed loops) belts, or in belting in lengths or links. These reviews exclude conveyor belts
and automotive belts, as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered by internal combustion engines,
including trucks, tractors, buses, and lift trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the periods of review the merchandise was classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) subheadings,
3926.90.55, 3926.90.56, 3926.90.57, 3926.90.59, 3926.90.60, 4010.10.10, 4010.10.50, 4010.91.11, 4010.91.15,

These reviews cover one Japanese manufacturer and exporter of industrial belts to the United States, Mitsuboshi
Belting Limited (MBL), and the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992, and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993.

Analysis of the Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of these administrative
reviews. We received a case brief from MBL, and a rebuttal brief from the petitioner, Gates Rubber Company. We did not
receive a request for a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 MBL acknowledges that the Department's resort to best information available (BIA) is authorized under section 776(c)
of the Tariff Act, since MBL did not respond to the Department's questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBL argues, however, that the Department should use information obtained in the first administrative review (1989&hyph;90)
as BIA instead of the rate from the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation. MBL contends that the Department
is required to consider the most recent information available in deciding upon a BIA rate. According to MBL, the information
provided by the respondent in the first administrative review is the most probative evidence of the current margin
because the LTFV margin was based solely on information provided by the petitioner for the period October 1986 through
March 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, MBL argues that it could not make an informed decision to reply to the questionnaires. MBL claims that
since the Department has not completed the 1990&hyph;91 review before distributing questionnaires for the 1991&hyph;92
and 1992&hyph;93 reviews, the Department cannot infer that MBL would have responded to these questionnaires if it
believed the margins for the 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93 reviews would be lower. Therefore, MBL claims that the
Department's conduct in this case is punitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, MBL points out that the International Trade Commission's affirmative injury determination is being appealed
at the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). MBL urges the Department not to assess antidumping duties and
order liquidation of their entries in a review where the validity of the underlying order is in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gates argues that the Department should not change its preliminary decision to resort to the LTFV margin from the original
investigation as BIA. Gates states that MBL has provided no authority for the proposition that the Department should
use as BIA the margin from the preliminary results in the 1989&hyph;90 administrative review. Gates contends that
knowledge of results of prior reviews is irrelevant. Gates submits that MBL knew it might receive the highest rate,
and that it would have submitted information proving lower margins if it could. Finally, Gates asserts that there
is no justification for delaying completion of the reviews.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act requires us to use BIA ``whenever a party or any other person refuses or is unable to
produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an
investigation.'' In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take
into account whether a party refuses to provide information requested (19 CFR 353.37(b)). MBL's contention that
the Department should use the information obtained in the 1989&hyph;90 administrative review is contrary to Department
policy. When a respondent refuses to cooperate with the Department, it is our policy to assign as a dumping margin to
that respondent, as BIA, the higher of: (1) The highest rate found for any firm in the original LTFV investigation or
previous administrative review, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review (Antifriction Bearings (Other
Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France et al, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Reviews, 57 FR 28360, 28379 (June 24, 1992)). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the
CAFC (see

, 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). Because MBL refused to respond to the Department's questionnaire, it was reasonable
for the Department to assign to MBL, as BIA, a rate of 93.16 percent, the highest rate found for any firm in the original
LTFV investigation. Furthermore, because the law does not provide for extensions of deadlines pending the outcome
of court decisions in other proceedings, we have not delayed our final results.

Final Results of the Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of these administrative reviews, the Department determines that a dumping margin of 93.16 percent exists
for MBL for the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992 and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The
Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results
of review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For subject merchandise exported by Mitsuboshi Belting Ltd., a cash deposit of 93.16 percent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For subject merchandise exported by manufacturers not covered in these reviews but covered in previous reviews
or in the original LTFV investigation, a cash deposit based on the most recently published rate in a final result or
determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in these reviews, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the
manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer
of the merchandise; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in these or any previous reviews conducted by the
Department, the cash deposit rate will be 93.16 percent, the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation,
as discussed below.

, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review
periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.

 On January 28, 1992, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its 1989&hyph;90 administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on certain internal-combustion, industrial forklift trucks from Japan. The
review covers two manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States during the period June 1, 1989

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 28, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
review of the antidumping duty order (June 7, 1988, 53 FR 20882) on certain internal-combustion, industrial forklift
trucks from Japan in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 3164). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this review are certain internal-combustion, industrial forklift trucks, with lifting
capacity of 2,000 to 15,000 pounds. The products covered by this review are further described as follows: Assembled,
not assembled, and less than complete, finished and not finished, operator-riding forklift trucks powered by gasoline,
propane, or diesel fuel internal-combustion engines of off-the-highway types used in factories, warehouses, or
transportation terminals for short-distance transport, towing, or handling of articles. Less than complete forklift
trucks are defined as imports which include a frame by itself or a frame assembled with one or more component parts.
Component parts of the subject forklift trucks which are not assembled with a frame are not covered by this order. During
the review period such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 692.4025, 692.4030, and 692.4070 of the Tariff
Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). The merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized
Tariff System (HTS) item numbers 8427.20.00&hyph;0, 8427.90.00&hyph;0, and 8431.20.00&hyph;0. The TSUSA and
HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review covers sales made by Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and Toyo Umpanki Company, Limited (TCM) during
the period from June 1, 1989 through May 31, 1990.

Such or Similar Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For all respondent companies, pursuant to section 771(16) of the Tariff Act, the Department established categories
of ``such or similar'' merchandise on the basis of load (lifting) capacity of the forklift as imported. Within these
categories, the product comparisons were based on six primary characteristics, to which points were assigned to
indicate their relative importance. These characteristics and their point totals are as follows: Tire type, 6 points;
upright style, 5 points; engine type, 4 points; transmission type, 3 points; maximum forklift height, 2 points; and
engine size, 1 point. The sum of these numbers, the ``SSM Index Number'', was used to match U.S. and home market (HM)
sales. We considered models that both summed to 21 points as identical. Where there were no identical products sold
in the home market, the Department selected the most similar product on the basis of the point totals resulting from
the six characteristics listed above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We found that in TCM's purchase price (PP) sales analysis, we did not include in the credit expense calculation the
time between shipment from Japan and subsequent shipment to the customer by TCM's U.S. subsidiary. Therefore, for
the final results, we included these expenses.

The Department gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. At the request of the
petitioners, (Hyster-Yale Company, Independent Lift Truck Builders Union, International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, International Union, Allied Industrial Workers of America (AFL&hyph;CIO), and United Shop
and Service Employees) and one respondent, a hearing was held on March 19, 1992. Case and rebuttal briefs were received
from petitioners, Toyota, and TCM.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that the Department should run its sales below cost of production (COP) test on comparison models
only, not on entire such or similar categories. Petitioners argue that forklifts are not a fungible product, but are
instead similar to ``job order'' products such as mechanical transfer presses, offshore oil platforms, and large
power transformers. Petitioners assert that the unique nature of each product means that there is often just one HM
sale that is comparable to the U.S. sale, and that if the single HM sale is sold below COP, there likely will be no dumping
margin. Petitioners state that this case is distinguishable from other dumping cases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
agricultural, chemical, or metals cases) because relatively few HM sales are weight-averaged. Petitioners accordingly
argue that the Department should conduct the sales below COP test on the concordance tape containing comparison models
only, not on the universe of HM sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCM argues that, because forklift trucks are not custom-built products, the Department correctly applied the COP
test. TCM further states that the Department should maintain its policy of conducting the COP test on each load capacity
category.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners. In accordance with our standard policy, we have revised the sales below COP test so that
the test is conducted on a model-specific basis instead of on a such-or-similar category basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners state that the Department should revise its model match methodology because it gives insufficient weight
to tire type and, therefore, results in more matches of merchandise, but not in matches that are the most similar. Petitioners
contend that tire type is a crucial attribute of a forklift truck because the tire type determines the construction
of the frame of the truck, which the Department found to be the ``identifying feature and principal component of the
product'' in the final determination in this case (Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Internal
Combustion Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan (Forklifts LTFV), 53 FR 12552 (April 15, 1988)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners suggest three alternative methods for the such or similar comparisons and tire type matching. First,
petitioners recommend that the Department return to the original less than fair value matching methodology. Second,
petitioners propose increasing the weight for tire type from six to ten points. Finally, petitioners state that matches
with less than fifteen points do not constitute similar merchandise because the predominant features of the HM merchandise
would be substantially different from the U.S. truck; petitioners argue that the Department should therefore omit
all HM sales with less than fifteen points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCM notes that the Department's current model match methodology was revised in order to improve the model match process.
TCM and Toyota argue that the Department's matching methodology, which gives tire type the highest weight, establishes
tire type as the most important criterion. Toyota contends that petitioners' assertion that forklift trucks cannot
be similar unless they have an SSM index number of fifteen is unreasonable. This cut-off would eliminate matches of
trucks that are ``identical in every respect&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;except upright style and its related
maximum fork height.'' Respondents further argue that the Department's twenty percent difference in merchandise
test already eliminates dissimilar models, and that the cut-off suggested by petitioners would merely result in
a greater number of unmatched sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with respondents. During the first administrative review, we refined the model match methodology used in
the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation. We are employing this same model match methodology for these final
results. One such improvement was the use of a point-weighting scheme, which increased the precision and simplified
the reporting requirements. Of the six model match elements, we attach the most weight to tire type. Petitioners did
not provide evidence to support their claim that the points accorded to tire type should be increased from six to ten,
or that dissimilar models were matched as the result of a flaw in our methodology. For further discussion of our model
match methodology see Comment 80, Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan; Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (Forklifts I), (57 FR 3167, January 28, 1992).

Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners' claim that the Department's adjustment for the consumption tax forgiven upon exportation of forklift
trucks to the United States is erroneous in several respects. Petitioners state that the Court of International Trade
(CIT) has held that taxes on sales in the HM must be passed through to the customer before an upward adjustment of an imputed
tax can be made to United States price (USP), and cite

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in support of this proposition. Petitioners contend that no adjustment is warranted in this case, since neither
Toyota nor TCM claimed or proved that the consumption tax imposed on HM sales is passed through to the customers in Japan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners further argue that the Department improperly made an adjustment to foreign market value (FMV) to eliminate
the absolute difference between the amount of tax in the two markets by adding to FMV the amount of the consumption tax
imputed to the U.S. sale. Petitioners state that it is improper for the Department to make such an adjustment in the
interest of achieving tax neutrality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota argues that petitioners' arguments disregard the Department's policy and practice with respect to adjustments
to FMV and USP for the Japanese consumption tax. Toyota cites the Department's disagreement with the CIT decisions
cited by petitioners. Toyota asserts that it is the Department's long-standing practice not to attempt to measure
the amount of tax passed through to customers in the HM. Under the Department's interpretation, section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act does not require the Department to measure the incidence of tax in an economic sense. Rather, according
to Toyota, the full adjustment for consumption tax is necessary to make an appropriate comparison between USP and
FMV. Toyota states that in determinations involving HM taxes, the Department has repeated that it has not had an opportunity
to appeal the issue on the merits. Until such time as the issue is finally resolved on appeal, the Department should
maintain its long-standing practice.

Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed
on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 at 12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal-Mogul 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decisions. The Department will add to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United
States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market
sales. The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments
will deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are
included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise
price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments
to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating
the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied
upon foreign market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses than the
price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP.

Comment 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Toyota contends that for the final results, the Department should not rely on best information available (BIA) to
calculate ocean freight, U.S. coop advertising, certain indirect selling expenses (ISE) incurred in Japan on behalf
of U.S. sales, and the offset expense for income and profit from other business ventures included in value-added.
Toyota claims that the Department made clear in its supplemental questionnaire that, because it was conducting two
administrative reviews simultaneously, Toyota should provide only a narrative description of how reallocations
and corrections were to be made, which were then to be the subject of petitioners' comment and Department scrutiny.
In its supplemental questionnaire response dated June 7, 1991, Toyota responded as directed, providing only narrative
descriptions, and not revised data on computer tape. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the Department made its decision regarding the accuracy of these reallocations and corrections, it would give
Toyota an opportunity to resubmit its data employing the proper reallocations and corrections. Toyota states that
it was therefore awaiting the Department's decisions concerning these recalculations for the first administrative
review before submitting revised computer tapes for the second review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota claims that at no time prior to the preliminary results, despite numerous contacts, did the Department ask
Toyota to submit the reallocations or corrections, instead directing Toyota to await the Department's decision
regarding these corrections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota contends that in the preliminary results of this review the Department applied BIA because it mistakenly held
that Toyota had failed to comply with the Department's request for data incorporating the reallocations and corrections.
Toyota claims that it did not provide such data because the Department never issued any instructions for doing so.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota therefore, proposes that the Department use data on the record to make the correct reallocations and corrections
for ocean freight, U.S. coop advertising, value-added, and Toyota Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. (TAL) ISE.

Petitioners assert that the Department specifically requested that Toyota submit corrections and reallocations
in its supplemental questionnaire. Petitioners state that Toyota failed to submit this data as requested, but rather
advised the Department that it would await the Department's decisions on these issues in the first administrative
review before submitting a complete response.

Department's Position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with Toyota. In our supplemental questionnaire dated May 23, 1991, we requested Toyota to provide within
a specified period of time a narrative explanation of its claimed adjustments to price after publication of the preliminary
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the final results, we did not request additional information for ocean freight, TAL ISE, and value-added because
we recalculated these expenses using information previously submitted by Toyota. See Comments 5, 7, and 8, respectively.
We did request supplemental information for coop advertising. See Comment 6.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Toyota claims that the Department's BIA recalculation of ocean freight and marine insurance is overstated because
the Department misunderstood documents provided by Toyota in conjunction with sales preselected by the Department
for a mini-verification of sales in Washington, DC prior to, or perhaps in lieu of, an on-site verification. One of
the sales involved a forklift which had a ``mast swap'' in the United States. In other words, the truck was imported
with one mast, but, prior to sale in the U.S., the mast was switched with that of another imported truck. Toyota provided
one invoice, marked ``chassis'' showing the truck as imported, including its original mast, and a second invoice,
marked ``mast'' for another truck, which included the mast which was subsequently fitted onto the first truck. Toyota
contends that the Department erroneously calculated a per-truck ocean freight expense by adding the amounts on the
two invoices, thereby yielding a per-unit figure for ocean freight equal to ocean freight for two trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota argues that the Department requested pre-verification documents, not explanations of these documents,
and that the documents were only provided to establish a paper trail for importation of the truck and not for calculation
of ocean freight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota requests that the Department recalculate ocean freight based on one invoice or the other, or perhaps an average,
but not on two per-truck amounts added together. Toyota maintains that its original allocation of ocean freight is
accurate and should be incorporated in the final results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Toyota notes a discrepancy between statements by the Department in the notice of preliminary results and the actual
BIA used to calculate sale-by-sale U.S. coop advertising expenses. The notice of preliminary results states that
the Department used the amounts Toyota reported for the first administrative review as U.S. coop expenses. See Certain
Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review (Forklifts I), 57 FR 3164 (January 28, 1992). Toyota observes that the Department actually used the largest
single reported U.S. coop expense from the second review and applied it to all sales as BIA. Toyota requests that the
Department use instead the per-customer coop expense from the first administrative review, as described in the preliminary
notice. Toyota maintains, however, that the appropriate allocation of this expense is over all sales, rather than
by dealer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that the BIA based on information from the second, rather than the first, administrative review
is reasonable because it is based on data that is on the record in this proceeding. Accordingly, petitioners argue
that the Department should continue to apply the largest single reported U.S. coop expense from the second review
to all sales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a supplemental questionnaire dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 23, 1991, we requested that Toyota allocate by dealer U.S. coop advertising expenses on a sale-by-sale basis.
In a letter dated March 30, 1992, we again requested that Toyota recalculate U.S. coop advertising expenses by dealer.
On April 13, 1992, Toyota submitted this information in an acceptable form, and we have used it in lieu of BIA for the

Toyota claims that in calculating the TAL ISE incurred with respect to U.S. sales in Japan, the Department should have
applied the ISE ratio to the TAL selling price, not to the much higher selling price of Toyota Motor Sales (TMS) in the
United States. Because the Department applied the ISE ratio to the wrong value, it greatly overstated the expense.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota further contends that, as is evident from the information submitted and verified in the first review, TAL incurred
the identical category of indirect selling expenses for HM sales as for U.S. sales. Toyota states that if the Department
deducts TAL indirect selling expenses from U.S. price, it must also in fairness deduct the same category of expenses
from HM price.

We agree with Toyota that in the preliminary results we incorrectly calculated ISE incurred in Japan by TAL with respect

Toyota contends that the Department erred in calculating an offset to value-added expenses for income and profit
earned from other business ventures. Toyota explains that the Department reduced general and administrative (G&amp;A)
expenses associated with value-added activity by an amount for net income and profit from other business ventures
that greatly exceeded that reported in its questionnaire response. Toyota requests that the Department revise its
income ``offset'' calculation for the final results to reflect the information contained in its questionnaire response.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Toyota claims that the Department incorrectly calculated U.S. credit expenses by using an intra-company interest
rate and not a rate based on its actual cost of borrowing from unrelated sources. Specifically, in calculating credit
expenses, the Department used the interest rate paid by TMS to Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (TMCC), its related
finance company. As a result, Toyota argues that the Department created a fictional ``expense'' that is based on an
internal transaction between TMS and TMCC which is irrelevant to the dumping analysis. Toyota urges the Department
to use the interest rate paid by TMCC on its short-term borrowings to calculate credit expenses for sales by TMS because
the rate paid by TMCC reflects Toyota's actual cost of financing from unrelated sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners disagree, arguing that the interest rate paid to outside sources by TMCC does not account for the total
cost actually incurred by TMCC to extend credit to TMS. Petitioners note that TMCC incurs expenses to obtain funds
to finance its operations as well as numerous operating expenses. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to base credit
expenses for TMS simply on the short-term interest rate paid by TMCC to outside sources without accounting for the
additional expenses incurred by TMCC to extend credit on sales made by TMS.

Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with Toyota. For the final results, we calculated U.S. credit expenses based on the experience of the sales
division of Toyota. Because TMS is the selling division in the United States, not TMCC, we determined that the interest
rate that should be used in the calculation of credit expense is one based on TMS' experience. Because TMS does not have
any short-term loans from unrelated sources, we have used the interest rate that TMCC charged TMS to reflect the credit
expenses incurred on U.S. sales. This approach is consistent with the credit expense methodology used in the previous
administrative review.

Petitioners claim that Toyota did not report certain direct magazine advertising expenses incurred on U.S. sales.
Petitioners state that these expenses consist of advertisements in national industry publications that were directed
at end-user customers of Toyota's U.S. forklift dealers, and refer to the Toyota Industrial Equipment Division (TIE)
of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Petitioners propose recalculating Toyota's direct U.S. selling expenses to
include these advertising expenses. Petitioners suggest that the Department divide Toyota's reported cost for
magazine advertisements during the period of review (POR) by the number of forklifts sold in the U.S. over the POR,
and add this amount to U.S. direct selling expenses for each forklift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota acknowledges that these magazine advertising expenses were classified as direct expenses by the Department
in the first review. See Forklifts I. However, respondent claims that petitioners' proposed recalculation of these
expenses is incorrect. Toyota notes that these expenses are specifically identified in its questionnaire response
and, therefore, should be separated out from reported ISE and reclassified as direct selling expenses.

We agree with both petitioners and Toyota that these magazine advertising expenses should be properly classified
as direct selling expenses. However, we disagree with petitioners' contention that Toyota failed to report such
expenses. Toyota did report these expenses under ISE in its questionnaire response. Thus, for these final results,
we deducted the amount of magazine advertising expenses identified by Toyota from reported ISE and reclassified
such expenses as direct selling expenses.

Comment 11:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners claim that Toyota did not report the cost incurred to retrofit its forklifts with redesigned seats under
its operator restraint safety seat (``ORS'') program. In support of this contention, petitioners have submitted
a Toyota advertisement, which petitioners claim offers free installation of new winged safety seats and seat belts
to end-users of subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners argue that all costs incurred under this program, including the cost of all advertisements, the cost
of the new seats, and the costs incurred to install the seats, should be considered direct U.S. selling expenses. Petitioners
assert that absent submission of proper information by Toyota, the Department should use the total ORS costs reported
by Toyota for the first administrative review and allocate those costs to sales during this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota maintains that the retrofit expenses referred to by petitioners were incurred solely for forklift trucks
imported and sold prior to the first period of review. Toyota notes that petitioners' argument erroneously implies
that the Department included retrofit expenses in its margin analysis for the first review. Respondent states that
the Department's first review verification report confirms that all trucks imported and sold during the first administrative
review period were manufactured with an ORS, thereby obviating the necessity of retrofittings.

Department's Position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with Toyota. Because there is no evidence on the record indicating that forklifts sold during the POR required
retrofitting, we determine that no adjustment is required. The advertisement submitted by petitioners makes no
reference to products sold during the POR. Petitioners have thus provided no evidence that Toyota incurred any such
expenses with respect to the Toyota sales made in the current POR.

Petitioners claim that Toyota failed to report U.S. product demonstration expenses, which were categorized by the
Department as direct selling expenses in the first review. Petitioners argue that Toyota should therefore be required
to provide its U.S. demonstration expenses for the final results. Petitioners assert that absent a proper submission

are equal to the per unit demonstration expenses reported by Toyota for its HM sales.

(July 11, 1991), Toyota maintains that it correctly categorized product demonstration expenses incurred in the
United States as ISE. Toyota claims that demonstration expenses incurred in the United States were incurred in demonstrating
forklifts to Toyota's national account customers. In contrast, Toyota states that demonstration expenses incurred
in the HM, which were reported as direct selling expenses, were incurred in demonstrating forklifts to dealers so
that they could demonstrate new models to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with petitioners that Toyota failed to report U.S. product demonstration expenses. By letter of March
30, 1992, we requested that Toyota separately report total demonstration expenses and allocate the same per forklift
truck. In its response dated April 6, 1992, Toyota claimed that it reallocated such expenses using the ratio of forklifts
under investigation to all units as reported in Exhibit C.4.i.1, page 2 of its December 5, 1990 response. However,
after reviewing the calculation, we determined that Toyota did not actually use this ratio. Thus, we corrected Toyota's
allocation for the final results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with petitioners that demonstration expenses incurred in the United States should be categorized as direct
selling expenses because in both the HM and the United States, Toyota incurs demonstration expenses in order to make
sales to end-users. Toyota's citation to AFBs I is irrelevant because AFBs I does not offer a clear statement of policy
with regard to demonstration expenses. Absent evidence that demonstrations serve different purposes in different
markets, we determine that Toyota's U.S. demonstration expenses should be treated as direct selling expenses. See
Forklifts I.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that these facts, in addition to other proprietary information, indicate Toyota assumed negative
U.S. value-added expenses on any sale for which the cost of the options removed from the forklift by TIE exceeded the
cost of options installed by TIE. Petitioners contend that Toyota incurs actual expenses to operate its value-added
facilities and to perform switching operations. They state that, for example, removing the forks from an imported
forklift results in an actual expense rather than a negative expense to TIE. Petitioners request that the Department
correct the negative costs and expenses reported by Toyota for net selling price proxy 3 by using the absolute values
of the negative amounts reported by Toyota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota contends that petitioners misinterpreted Toyota's value-added calculation. Toyota explains that labor
and overhead are always positive; however, if the value-added materials are negative and are added to labor and overhead,
the value-added will be increased, but remain negative.

We agree with Toyota. While the reported amount for value-added and switching operations is negative, Toyota accounted

Comment 17: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that Toyota's claimed credit revenue for its U.S. sales should be rejected because the credit revenue
for certain sales is actually earned on sales by unrelated dealers to end-user customers and not on the sale from Toyota
to the unrelated dealer. Petitioners state that Toyota sells forklifts in the United States to unrelated dealers
and that the first unrelated sale is the sale from Toyota to the dealer. Petitioners contend that the purpose of this
review, as stated in the questionnaire, is to examine sales by Toyota to the first unrelated customer. Petitioners
argue that credit revenue earned on sales from the unrelated dealer to the end-user, which are financed through TMCC,
is therefore irrelevant to this review, because the financing arranged by TMCC is a separate transaction from the
sale of the forklift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota argues that TMCC retains both the title to, and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) interest in, the forklift
until TMCC receives payment from either the dealer or end-user. Toyota contends that a shift in the credit transaction
from the dealer to the end-user is no more than a shift in the source of payment. In both cases, TMCC retains ownership
and the UCC interest in the forklift. Because Toyota retains a direct relationship with the dealer or end-user, the
credit revenue is directly related to the sale of the forklift, and therefore, the credit transaction should be adjusted
for. Toyota further contends that its ability to sell forklifts is contingent upon its ability to encourage end-users
to buy forklifts. Toyota notes, for example, that the Department considers its subsidies of yellow page advertisements
for dealers a direct selling expense. Toyota's provision of favorable financing to end-users similarly is intended
to encourage end-user sales, which in turn create sales to dealers. Toyota concludes by noting that it would be unfair
and illogical to account for TMCC's credit expense and not its revenue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 353.41 of the Department's regulations, we used the price to the first unrelated purchaser
in the United States as the basis of U.S. price. Toyota's USP was based on the price TMS/TIE charged its unrelated dealers.
Therefore, we consider revenue generated as a result of the sale by the dealer to the end-user through a financing arrangement
a separate transaction, and as such, not directly associated with the sales under review, as claimed by Toyota. This
credit arrangement is unlike Toyota's subsidy for yellow pages advertisements, which is properly treated as a direct
selling expense. That TMCC retains both the title to, and the UCC interest in, the financed forklift until TMCC receives
the final payment from the end-user has no bearing on the calculation of USP. Finally, we note that, contrary to Toyota's
assertion, we are not accounting for TMCC's credit expense. We therefore disallowed the claimed adjustment for credit
revenue for the sales financed by the end-user.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota does not believe that the Department applied the correct legal test for determining whether these advertising

We agree with petitioners. These advertising expenses are indirect because they are not directed at Toyota's customer's

expenses. See Forklifts I, Comment 18. The data submitted in this proceeding is very similar to that submitted and
disproved during verification in the previous administrative review. We have no compelling evidence on the record
in this proceeding which indicates that the situation is any different from that found previously. We have therefore

Petitioners claim that Toyota failed to support adequately its claim concerning credit expenses incurred by Toyota
on PP sales. Petitioners state that, for reasons based on proprietary information, the claimed method of payment
used with respect to these sales is incorrect. Petitioners assert that, accordingly, the Department should use BIA
with respect to this expense for the final results. According to petitioners, the Department should also consider
associated bank charges in determining this BIA. Petitioners state that bank charges should be among several elements
considered in this BIA. Petitioners provide a calculation, using data from Toyota's ESP response, of the average
time between the date the forklifts were exported from Japan and the date the forklifts were imported into the United
States. Petitioners contend that this calculation represents the best method for imputing Toyota's credit expense
for PP sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota asserts that, because of the immediate payment term on PP sales, there is no credit expense, as concluded by
the Department in Forklifts LTFV and Forklifts I, which included two verifications. Toyota states that the Department
should not change its practice in this administrative review.

Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners that reported credit expenses are incorrect. Although Toyota's PP sales are made on immediate
payment terms (immediate with respect to the date of delivery in the United States), Toyota still incurs some credit
expense on these transactions for the time between shipment and payment. An expense must therefore be imputed on PP
sales for the time between shipment from Japan and payment. Because entry dates are unavailable, we used the average
number of days between shipment and payment calculated by petitioners in their case brief. Petitioners' figure is
based on data provided by Toyota. However, we have no information on the record indicating that Toyota incurred bank
charge fees associated with the immediate payment PP sales and, thus, we cannot make an adjustment for such fees.

TCM objects to the Department's allocation of selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) over U.S.
further manufacturing cost in cases involving ``swap-downs'' of masts (substitutions of low-value masts for masts
of higher value). In such situations, TCM has allocated a negative SG&amp;A amount to further manufacturing. In the
Department's preliminary results ESP computer program, wherever a negative amount was reported for the further
manufacturing SG&amp;A expense, this amount was multiplied by negative one in order to convert it to a positive value.
TCM claims that these negative amounts should not have been converted to positive amounts because the SG&amp;A expenses
that were allocated to the import values were inflated so as to include an offset amount equal to the absolute value
of the negative value-added SG&amp;A amounts. As a result, according to TCM, the amount of total U.S. SG&amp;A deducted
from USP has been inflated well beyond the total actual expense incurred. TCM requests that the Department correct
this problem in the computer program so that only the actual SG&amp;A expenses will be deducted from U.S. price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners argue that the Department should recalculate TCM's value-added using positive U.S. SG&amp;A amounts
for those U.S. value-added sales where TCM listed negative SG&amp;A amounts. Petitioners state that it is not possible
to have negative labor, factory overhead, or SG&amp;A from value-added operations. Petitioners suggest applying
the highest reported SG&amp;A amount to these sales as BIA or, in the alternative, assigning a positive value to all
SG&amp;A expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners also argue that, despite the arguments in its brief, TCM has not offered support for its contention that
TCM allocated the total U.S. SG&amp;A amount, plus an offsetting increase, to the truck as imported for those sales
where it allocated negative SG&amp;A in further manufacturing. Petitioners also contend that there is insufficient
information (i.e., calculation of total SG&amp;A, or identification of the field where the SG&amp;A amount allocated
to the value of the truck as imported is recorded) on the record for the Department to verify TCM's claim. Finally, petitioners
claim that TCM's use in its case brief of a hypothetical_rather than an actual_example is not sufficient. Petitioners,
therefore, contend that the Department should continue to use the same methodology for allocating U.S. SG&amp;A
to U.S. further manufacturing costs that was used for the preliminary results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners that it is not appropriate to attribute negative SG&amp;A expenses to further processing
operations. However, in the preliminary results, our treatment of SG&amp;A understated the value of TCM's imported
product and overstated TCM's value-added for those products for which TCM reported negative SG&amp;A. As a result
of these over- and under-statements, we have decided not to follow the methodology employed in Forklifts I and in the
preliminary results of this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two facts must be considered in determining how to treat TCM's reported negative SG&amp;A properly. First, the processing
that TCM undertook must result in the allocation of positive SG&amp;A expenses both to the imported product and to
the further processing operations conducted by TCM. Second, the sum of the SG&amp;A allocated to TCM's imported product
and TCM's value-added must be equal to the amount incurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we have allocated a portion of TCM's SG&amp;A expenses to the COM of the further processing operations
and deducted this amount from USP. The COM of the further processing operations is the sum of the cost of all materials
added to the forklift truck, plus the labor and factory overhead costs incurred by TCM. The remaining SG&amp;A amount,
which we attributed to the imported product, was not deducted. This allocation distributes the actual amount of SG&amp;A
expense incurred between further manufacturing and the imported product. This methodology therefore results in
an allocation of positive SG&amp;A to both the further manufacturing operations and the imported product. The amount
allocated to the imported product also does not exceed the amount incurred for the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To do this, we calculated on a sale-by-sale basis the factor represented by TCM's reported SG&amp;A as a share of the
total reported manufacturing costs associated with further manufacturing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, positive and negative values). We then used this factor, which was always positive
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to generate an SG&amp;A amount for each transaction by applying the factor only to the positive costs associated
with further manufacturing. We thereby guaranteed that the SG&amp;A value attributed to further manufacturing
was always positive.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This factor will always be positive because TCM always assigned a negative SG&amp;A to the negative total manufacturing
costs associated with the further manufacturing of the swapdown models. The negative SG&amp;A divided by the negative
total COM yields a positive factor.

: TCM argues that, in the ESP program, for situations in which FMV is based on constructed value (CV), the Department
neglected to deduct direct selling expenses from FMV. TCM argues that such an adjustment is in accordance with the
Department's longstanding practice. TCM cites section 772(e) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.41(e); Tapered Roller
Bearings from Japan (52 FR 30700, August 17, 1987); Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan (50 FR

Petitioners assert that the Department must first define the direct selling expenses variable before a COS adjustment
can be made, noting that the variable was not defined in either the Department's January 29, 1992 ESP program or in a

: Petitioners argue that verification of TCM's cost data is necessary because this data has never been verified. Petitioners
state that TCM's cost data was neither verified in the investigation, because the cost data was not accepted, nor in
the first administrative review, due to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War. Petitioners assert that good cause for
verification still exists and is shown by petitioners' April 9, 1991 letter to the Department, which petitioners
claim documents extensive discrepancies in TCM's unverified cost data. Accordingly, petitioners claim that the
Department should conduct verification of TCM's cost information prior to issuing its final results.

TCM replies that the Department is not required to conduct verification of TCM's COP data in this review. According
to TCM, the Department is required to conduct verification in an administrative review only if an interested party
files a timely request for verification and if the Department has not conducted a verification during the two immediately
preceding reviews. TCM also notes that the Department is not required to verify all sections of a respondent's questionnaire
response. In this context, TCM argues that the Department satisfied these requirements in the previous review by
conducting verification of TCM's HM and U.S. sales, and further manufacturing expenses. Because the Department
was able to verify TCM's information in the previous review, TCM argues that no further verification is necessary
in this review.

Department's Position
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: With respect to administrative reviews, the Department is required to verify information under section 776(b)(3)
of the Tariff Act if the Secretary concludes that good cause for verification exists, or if a timely request for verification
is received from an interested party and the Department has not conducted a verification during either of the two immediately
preceding administrative reviews. The current administrative review is the second review of the antidumping order
in this case. Thus, verification is not required under section 776(b)(3) of the Act. TCM's HM sales, U.S. sales and
U.S. costs, including value-added cost data from TCM's related facilities in the United States, were verified in
the previous administrative review. The Department determined that TCM's data reporting methodology was sound
and reliable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because verification was not required and all other aspects of TCM's sales were successfully verified in the previous
review, because our analysis of TCM's response did not indicate any significant discrepancies, and because petitioners
did not make a compelling case that TCM's data was seriously flawed, we determined that presently there was no good
cause to verify TCM's submitted cost data.

: Petitioners argue that for the final results, the Department should revise the method it used to adjust for commissions
on TCM's sales. For PP transactions, petitioners submit that the commission offset rule directs the Department to
reduce USP by the lesser of the HM commission or U.S. ISE when commissions are paid in one market and not in the other.
Petitioners contend that TCM failed to report ISE for its PP sales and that the Department should accordingly deny
the commissions claimed by TCM for its HM sales.

With respect to ESP transactions, petitioners state that the preliminary margin program incorrectly deducted all
HM commissions from HM price and all U.S. commissions from USP. Petitioners state that commissions should be deducted
from both home market price and U.S. price only with respect to ESP comparisons that include a commission in both transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCM responds that the special rule governing commission offsets does not require that commissions be paid on every
sale in both markets. Rather, TCM contends that this rule applies only when no commissions are paid on any sales in one
of the markets under consideration. Because TCM pays commissions on certain sales in both markets, TCM concludes
that the Department should continue to treat commissions as direct selling expenses in both the U.S. and home markets,
and thereby not employ the offset rule in comparisons in which commissions are incurred in only one transaction.

Department's Position
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Petitioners' assertion that TCM failed to report U.S. ISE on PP transactions is incorrect. For the final results,
we modified our PP computer program to deduct HM commissions from FMV and then offset them by adding U.S. ISE up to the
amount of the HM commissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to ESP sales, we agree with petitioners to the extent that the mere existence of commissions on some sales
in both markets does not automatically preclude the use of the offset rule. Our standard practice requires that for
comparisons involving ESP for which a commission is incurred in both markets, we deduct the U.S. commission from ESP
and the HM commission from FMV. For comparisons in which there is a commission paid in one market and none in the other
market, we offset the commission with ISE incurred in the other market, to the extent of the lesser of the commission
in the one market or the ISE in the other. In order to follow this standard practice, we have modified our ESP computer
program for the final results because, in our preliminary results calculations, we did not offset the commission
with ISE for comparisons in which a commission was paid in one market and not in the other.

: Petitioners contend that HM transactions that have shipment dates prior to March 1, 1989 are not within the relevant
reporting period (March 1, 1989 to July 31, 1990) and therefore should be disregarded for comparison purposes. Petitioners
note that the questionnaire states that ``[t]here can be no new dates of sale after shipment and any subsequent price
modifications must be reported as either a rebate or a discount.'' Petitioners further contend that TCM's response
supports the use of shipment date as the appropriate date of sale, because it states that the date of sale is equivalent
to the estimated date of receipt by the customer. In the interests of consistency, petitioners also suggest matching
U.S. sales to HM sales on the basis of shipment dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In response, TCM argues that the date of sale, rather than the date of shipment, determines the reporting period for
HM sales. TCM further argues that, in accordance with Department practice, TCM reported as the date of sale the date
on which the parties were bound by the terms of sales. Because TCM followed the Department's requirements in determining
dates of sale and reporting HM sales, and because the Department did not request from TCM additional information regarding
sale dates, TCM concludes that the Department should not revise its reporting requirements for HM dates of sale.

We have therefore used the HM date of shipment as the date of sale instead of the date of delivery, which TCM reported

with regard to matching to the U.S. sale dates. We found that all but two of TCM's proposed matches were suitably contemporaneous,
and that these transactions were only used for matching with two ESP sales. We assigned these two sales the weighted-average
dumping margin calculated for ESP sales.

TCM responds that it reported the expenses in question in accordance with the Department's instructions. According
to TCM, it initially reported all SG&amp;A expenses that it incurred in the United States as either direct or indirect
selling expenses. The Department subsequently requested, however, that TCM segregate G&amp;A from selling expenses,
and allocate the G&amp;A expenses to TCM's U.S. further processing operations. Thus, TCM asserts that petitioners'

We agree with petitioners. The G&amp;A expenses in question pertain to all of TCM's U.S. sales of subject merchandise,

Petitioners claim that there are two errors in the U.S. ISE that TCM reported for sales by another related subsidiary,
Mitsui Machinery Distribution, Inc. (MMD). First, petitioners claim that sale-by-sale ISE shown in TCM's sales
listing does not reconcile with the formula provided by TCM (ISE factor x net price). In particular, petitioners state
that the amounts reported for certain ESP sales are lower than the amount that results from applying the formula. Petitioners
request that the Department recalculate this expense using the formula provided by TCM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, petitioners claim that TCM failed to report an amount for MMD's G&amp;A in TCM's reported ISE. Petitioners
request that the Department allocate a portion of the ``General G&amp;A'' reported by TCM to MMD's forklift truck
sales to derive a G&amp;A ratio for MMD, then multiply this factor by net sales price for each of MMD's sales to compute
G&amp;A expenses for each sale.

We agree with petitioners that TCM did not calculate a G&amp;A factor for MMD. We have corrected this omission using
the factor, calculated using TCM's data, provided by petitioners in their case brief because this factor offers a
reasonable estimate of MMD's G&amp;A expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree that TCM failed to calculate properly the amounts reported for ISE on MMD's sales. In reviewing petitioners'
Attachment 4 to the case brief, we found that petitioners included an incorrect amount for dealer inspection/prep
charge and that petitioners did not, as TCM's sample calculation showed, allocate a portion of the ISE to U.S. value-added.
After adjusting petitioners' calculations in Attachment 4 to account for the correct dealer inspection/prep charge
and the ISE reported in U.S. value-added, we found that for the calculations sampled, the results matched the amounts

Petitioners contend that TCM's brokerage expenses are understated because the brokerage allocation factor (total
brokerage costs for U.S. forklift sales divided by total revenue from U.S. forklift sales) was multiplied by transfer
price instead of sales price. Petitioners request that the Department recalculate this expense by multiplying the
brokerage factor by sales price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCM replies that the total revenue over which it allocated brokerage expenses was the revenue of TCM's factory in Japan,
which represents the aggregate of all TCM's transfer prices. Because it calculated its brokerage expense factor
by allocating brokerage expenses over transfer prices, TCM argues that it is appropriate to calculate per-unit brokerage
expenses by multiplying this expense factor by TCM's reported transfer prices.

We agree with TCM. We find TCM's allocation method for calculating Japanese brokerage charges to be reasonable. TCM
calculated a factor by dividing total Japanese brokerage paid on its exports of forklift trucks to the United States
by the total transfer prices (revenue recorded by the factory at Shiga) of the forklifts exported to the United States.
Because the Japanese brokerage charges would have been paid on the basis of the transfer price, it is reasonable that
TCM would use this in the denominator of the allocation equation.

TCM argues that petitioners misunderstand TCM's method for calculating trading company markups. According to TCM,
it pays trading companies a single fee that includes movement expenses incurred by the trading companies and the trading
companies' markup. In its response, TCM separately reported the movement expenses and the markup; the total of these
items represented the single fee that TCM paid to the trading company. In those instances in which the trading company
markup is negative, the actual movement expenses incurred by the trading company exceed the fee that the trading company
receives from TCM; thus, the negative markup reported by TCM is a downward adjustment to actual movement expenses,
paid by the trading company, to reflect the amount paid by TCM. Because TCM's reporting method is accurate and is based
on actual expenses, TCM asserts that the use of BIA is unwarranted. Should the Department determine to reject TCM's
negative trading company markup, TCM requests that the Department set any negative amounts equal to zero, in order
to reflect the actual movement expenses incurred by the trading companies.

Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As in the first review, we treated the trading company markups as a movement charge. The appropriate deduction to USP
for inland freight is the expense incurred by TCM. Because the addition of the negative markup yields the actual expense
incurred by TCM for this sale, we have, for the final results, recalculated inland freight using TCM's submitted data.

Comment 32: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that interest income claimed by TCM from long-term installment sales may have been earned on
sales from TCM's unrelated dealers to end-users rather than on sales from TCM to its dealers, and as such should not
be added to the price of TCM's sales. Petitioners assert that installment sales are generally sales to end-users rather
than to dealers. In addition, petitioners claim that TCM did not properly justify the interest rate it used in calculating
this income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCM argues that the credit income at issue is earned by TCM itself, not by its dealers. TCM further argues that such income
is a legitimate increase to U.S. price, because it is agreed to by the customer at the time of sale. Therefore, TCM claims
that the Department should continue to add credit income to U.S. price for the final results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with petitioners. Concerning the issue of whether the installment sales in question were made by TCM to
its unrelated dealers, as opposed to sales from the dealers to end-users, we have not found any evidence that these
transactions did not concern sales by TCM to its dealers. We also do not have any evidence that TCM did not collect the
credit income that it has reported, regardless of the interest rate that it charged. Therefore we have continued to
add credit income to USP for the final results.

Comment 33: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners, citing Color Picture Tubes from Korea (52 FR 44186, November 18, 1987), contend that TCM's U.S. advertising
expenses are direct selling expenses because the advertisements are aimed at a purchaser who buys the merchandise
from the first unrelated purchaser or from a subsequent purchaser, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the customer's customer. Petitioners further contend that a TCM advertisement submitted as Exhibit 6 of petitioners'
case brief is proof that these expenses are direct advertising expenses because the advertisement: (1) specifically
promotes internal-combustion forklifts subject to this review; (2) identifies TCM Manufacturing, USA, Inc., TCM
America, Inc., and C. Itoh Industrial Machinery, Inc., as the source of the advertisement; and (3) does not refer to
or promote specific TCM dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners submit that TCM failed to support its claim that all of its U.S. advertisements were indirect selling
expenses and state that the Department should therefore reject TCM's claim and treat all of the advertising expenses
as direct expenses. Petitioners provide calculations for allocating this expense as a direct selling expense to
forklifts sold through CIM and to forklifts sold through MMD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In rebuttal, TCM argues that the only advertising expenses related to subject merchandise were for general corporate
advertising, rather than advertising for specific products. TCM further argues that the advertising cited by petitioner
does not relate to subject merchandise, because it concerns forklift trucks manufactured in the United States. Because
TCM's advertising is either intended to promote the company as a whole, or is not related to forklift trucks produced
in Japan, TCM concludes that the Department should treat TCM's U.S. advertising expenses as indirect selling expenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners that these expenses are direct selling expenses because these advertisements, as evident
from the examples submitted by TCM, are aimed at the ultimate consumer. We disagree with TCM regarding TCM's claim
that the advertising in question is unrelated to subject merchandise because the trucks sold by TCM in the United States
were in fact manufactured in Japan, and were, at most, customized through further processing in the United States.
Therefore, we have treated these advertising expenses as a direct selling expense in the final results.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of administrative
review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, as provided
by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be the rates as listed
above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue
to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; and (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered by
this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will
be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise.

Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty order for the purposes of
establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping
findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department
has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative
review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation)
as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative
reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 39.45 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the amended final notice of the LTFV investigation
by the Department (53 FR 20882, June 7, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely
written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby
requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.

(50 FR 48819; November 27, 1985).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested
parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or no interested party requests
an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month.

On December 3, 1993, Florida Steel Corporation and Chaparral Steel Co., domestic producers and petitioners in the

The draft FMP proposes the following management measures: (1) Prohibit the harvest or possession of stony corals,
whether dead or alive, except for legally permitted research, education, and restoration programs; (2) prohibit
the harvest or possession of sea fans and gorgonians (octocorals) and any species in the fishery management unit if
attached or existing upon live-rock, live or dead, except for legally permitted research, education, and restoration
programs; (3) prohibit the sale or possession of any prohibited species unless the specimen entered the management
area in interstate or international commerce and is fully documented as to point of origin; (4) prohibit the use of
chemical, plants or plant-derived toxins, and explosives to harvest organisms in the coral fishery management unit,
except for legally permitted research, education, and restoration programs; (5) limit harvest of fishery management
unit organisms except for those listed in Appendix A, to hand-held dip-nets, slurp guns, hand and other non-habitat
destructive gear, except for legally permitted research, education, and restoration programs; (6) require an annual
permit to harvest or possess organisms in the fishery management unit; (7) require collectors, dealers, and exporters
of species managed under the coral plan to acquire an annual permit, to submit monthly records and report harvest,
shipments, and unit cost; and (8) establish a Marine Conservation District (MCD) in the exclusive economic zone,
due south of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, within the coordinates specified below; no possession while moored, fishing,
or harvesting of any organisms will be allowed in the MCD; no anchoring will be allowed in the MCD. Exceptions to the
above restrictions are allowed for legally permitted research, education, and restoration programs.

Inasmuch as no agreement was reached in recent consultations between the Governments of the United States and the
People's Republic of China on a mutually satisfactory solution regarding the extension of the bilateral textile
agreement, including quota limits, illegal transshipment of textile products from China, overshipping annual
limits, and other violations of the provisions of the bilateral agreement, the United States Government has decided
to establish limits for the period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994. The annual
limits for January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 shall be effective January 17, 1994.

It should be noted that CITA, under Executive Order 11651, as amended, and section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956,
as amended, intends to permanently deny entry to goods which have been shipped in excess of the 1994 limits.

This notice of availability is for the Final Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI)
prepared for the disposal and reuse of Cameron Station, Virginia. The EA has assessed the potential environmental
impacts for two proposed reuse alternatives: to develop Cameron Station for mixed use; or to place Cameron Station
into caretaker status. The first alternative involves the development of Cameron Station as follows: mixed residential
on 70 acres, commercial/retail on 16 acres, open space/recreation on 50.5 acres, and 16 acres for infrastructure
use. The second alternative would place all buildings and grounds in caretaker status.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy (DOE) has received an application by Tucson Electric Power
Company (TEP) to rescind the Prohibition Order issued on July 15, 1981 (46 FR 37960, July 23, 1981), pursuant to the
Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) 42 U.S.C. 8301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The order prohibited the burning of oil or natural gas in TEP's Irvington Generating Station Units 1, 2 and 3, located
near Tucson, Arizona. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 501.102(b), TEP filed its application based on a substantial change in the circumstances upon which
the Prohibition Order was originally issued. TEP claims this change in circumstances to be beyond its control. TEP
cites the sharp reduction in economic benefits to be realized from the conversion to coal and the potentially costly
environmental disincentives to using coal, combined with TEP's financial situation, as the impetus for the requested
relief. TEP requests rescission to permit the company to continue to use oil or natural gas above the percentage limits
specified in the prohibition order.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for relicensing of the existing Spencer
Mountain Hydroelectric Project, Project No. 2607&hyph;001. The project is located on the South Fork Catawba River
in Gaston County, North Carolina. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include economic and engineering analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in the final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice and the attached scoping document is to solicit comments from interested individuals,
organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns that will assist the staff in identifying
the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scoping document will: (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed projects, (2)
identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis, (3) identify reasonable
alternatives to be addressed in the EA, and (4) solicit all available information, especially quantified data, on
the resource issues, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments must be filed no later than March 1, 1994 with: Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol Street, NE., room 3100, Washington, DC 20426.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on December 23, 1993, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) of 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84111 filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;159&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.216 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to abandon minor pressure regulating facilities
under the blanket authorization issued by the Commission in Docket No. CP82&hyph;491&hyph;000 pursuant to section
7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questar proposes to abandon its Huntington District Regulator Station (HU0005 DRS) located adjacent to its six-inch
Jurisdictional Lateral (J.L.) No. 44 located in Emery County, Utah, used in conjunction with providing gas service
to Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel), Questar's local distribution company affiliate. Questar states
that the facilities to be abandoned at the HU0005 DRS comprise approximately 100 feet of three, four and six-inch piping
and one pressure regulating valve assembly. Questar states that the investment associated with the facilities to
be abandoned is $15,129. Questar states that because these facilities function solely to reduce delivery pressures
for individual downstream sales and transportation delivery meter stations, no actual deliveries were made directly
through these facilities. Questar states that following abandonment, the 3-inch Huntington Tap will remain in service.
Questar states that because Mountain Fuel will continue to deliver to its customers via individual meter and regulating
stations along the length of J.L. No. 44, there will be no abandonment of gas service to Mountain Fuel or its customers
as a result of granting it permission to abandon the HU0005 DRS.

Great Lakes states that MCV is an existing shipper to whom it provides firm transportation service of up to 80,000 Mcf
of gas per day under Part 284 of the Commission's regulations. Great Lakes states that it currently receives the gas
at its Emerson Receipt Point, located in Great Lakes' Western Zone, and delivers gas to MCV through the Chippewa Meter
Station on Great Lakes' mainline. Great Lakes states that the design capability of the Chippewa Meter Station has
now been exceeded and that MCV has requested it to construct and operate a new delivery point (Midland Meter Station)
to provide flexibility and the security of a second delivery point. Great Lakes states that the Midland Meter Station
will consist of taps, two turbine meters, a gas separator, and an electronic measurement system. Great Lakes estimates
that the cost to construct the facilities will be about $1.4 million. Great Lakes states that the Midland Meter Station
and existing transportation service will not impact its existing peak day and annual deliveries, and the transportation
service will continue to be provided, under Part 284 of the Commission's regulation, without detriment to service
to any other shipper on its system.

Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing, to become effective on February
1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

service for the twelve months ended September 30, 1993, as adjusted for known and measurable changes through June

expenses, increased costs of material and supplies, increased costs of transportation by others, increased depreciation
expense, increased taxes, stranded costs, and increased plant investment. The filed rate of return is based on a capitalization
of 65.73 percent common equity and 34.27 percent debt with an equity return of 14 percent.

CNG's filing includes primary and alternate tariff sheets. CNG states that the primary tariff sheets reflect the

Take notice that on December 30, 1993, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC
Gas Tariff, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A to the filing, to become effective March 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that the tariff sheets reflect an anticipated reduction in the level of firm service from its customer,
Atlanta Gas Light Company, and a reduced level of jurisdictional revenues from the level established under the compliance
filing in Docket No. RS92&hyph;10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that it has continued to employ the Straight Fixed Variable method for cost classification, cost
allocation and rate design and has utilized the mitigation methods required by the Commission in its Order of September
3, 1993. In order to prevent a significant increase to Southern's remaining firm customers as a result of the reduced
firm service entitlements Southern proposes to (1) design IT rates based on a 75% load factor basis, (2) charge separately
for injections and withdrawals into the Contract Storage Service (CSS) and the ANR Storage Service, and (3) revise
the allocation methodology for the ANR Storage Service to reflect the use of contract demands for allocating costs
to this incremental service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern requests waiver of the five-month suspension period in order to allow the proposed tariff sheets to become
effective March 1, 1994, the date the anticipated reduced service levels will become effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Southern states that the purpose of this filing is to set forth additional known and measurable GSR costs which have
been paid or incurred by Southern since the filing on December 1, 1993 of its first GSR cost recovery filing in Docket
No. RP94&hyph;67&hyph;000. Southern states that it sets forth in this filing the revised demand surcharges and revised
interruptible rates that will be charged in connection with its recovery of GSR costs associated with the reformation
of additional gas supply contracts that have become unnecessary and/or unmarketable as a result of the receipt by
Southern of revised service elections from its customers following the mandatory restructuring by Southern of its
pipeline services under Order No. 636. Southern requests that the tariff sheets be made effective on February 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that it seeks to recover $53.8 million in GSR costs which has been paid or incurred in connection with
the reformation of two gas supply contracts. Southern states that these GSR costs have arisen as a direct result of
the need to realign gas supply contracts following customers' elections during restructuring to terminate their
sales entitlements under Order No. 636. Southern further states that none of the GSR costs sought to be recovered in
the instant filing constitute take-or-pay settlement costs under gas supply contracts existing at March 31, 1989
which would be subject to the provisions of Southern's 1988 take-or-pay settlement in Docket No. RP86&hyph;63&hyph;000.

Take notice that on December 30, 1993, Viking Gas Transmission Company (Viking) tendered for filing as part of its
FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, revised tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing, to be effective
February 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Viking states that the purpose of this filing is to make several miscellaneous tariff modifications to reflect the
acquisition of Viking's stock by Northern States Power Company and changes in personnel, addresses and telephone
numbers occasioned by that acquisition. In addition, Viking proposes to: (1) Change the time for commencement of
the gas day from 8 a.m. to 12:00 noon; (2) establish a minimum delivery threshold for the installation of electronic
measurement equipment; (3) delete the PGA clause from its tariff, as no longer required; (4) eliminate references
to Order No. 497 that are no longer appropriate in view of the Commission's recent finding that Viking is currently
not subject to Order No. 497 (see East Tennessee Natural Gas Co., et al., Dockets Nos. MG91&hyph;4&hyph;001 et al.,
65 FERC Paragraph 61,389 (December 23, 1993), mimeo at 39&hyph;40); (5) delete a reference to common operating personnel
with Viking's former affiliate, Minnesota Intrastate Transmission System; (6) change the governing law in its pro-forma
service agreements from Texas to Minnesota; and (7) revise the index of shippers to reflect contract modifications
occasioned by implementation of Order No. 636. Finally, Viking has modified its tariff to correct several miscellaneous
typographical errors.

Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January
11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference
room.

Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a new ICR for gathering information on the design, operation, and performance of biological treatment technologies
from remediation experts and managers working at sites where biological treatment technologies are being tested
or implemented. The authority for collecting information on innovative treatment technologies is described at
Section 311 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, Section 8003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, Section 7001 of the Oil Pollution Act, and Section 10 of the Toxic Substance Control Act. The information will
help the EPA to deploy innovative technologies more quickly at Superfund and other sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selected respondents will be asked to complete and return, via mail, a two-part questionnaire. The first part requests
general site information, such as location, contacts, contaminants, and legislative authority under which the
site is being remediated. The second part requests site-specific biotechnology information, such as the stage of
the operation, wastes and media being treated, clean-up level goals, and the performance and cost of the treatment.
All responses will be strictly voluntary. Following the initial questionnaire, respondents will receive follow-up
questionnaires on a semi-annual basis to update the information already provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA will enter the information from completed questionnaires into computer databases that will be publicly accessible
through computerized bulletin boards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden Statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public reporting burden for respondents is estimated to average 1.6 hours per response with 5 hours per response for
the first-time respondents and 0.5 hours for respondents updating previous responses, including time for reviewing
instructions, gathering and compiling the data needed, and completing and reviewing the questionnaire.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, title VI, section 6002(b), 107 Stat. 312,
395 (1993), amended sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n) and 332, to
create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. Under the amended statute, certain private
land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' licensees and will be treated
as common carriers subject to the foreign ownership and control restrictions of section 310(b) of the Communications
Act. A ``grandfathering'' provision, however, in new section 332(c)(6) permits the Commission to grant waivers
of section 310(b) to private land mobile licensees that petition the Commission by February 10, 1994. This present
action clarifies the filing procedures for such petitions and reminds all potentially affected private radio licensees
of the February 10, 1994 filing deadline. The Commission will use the waiver petitions to determine whether each given
petitioner should be permitted to retain foreign ownership or control, pursuant to statute.

 Section 310(d) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires that common carriers and noncommon carrier
permittees or licensees contemplating a transfer of control apply for authority to make such transfer. In addition
to information specified on FCC Form 704, applicants may be required to file other information. Information is used
by FCC staff to determine whether an entity seeking control of an existing permittee or licensee is legally and financially
qualified to become a common carrier or noncommon carrier telecommunications licensee. If the information is not
submitted the above determination required by the Communications Act could not be made. The FCC Form 704 has been revised
to incorporate a certification pursuant to rules implementing the provisions of section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse
Act of 1988.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a final guideline entitled ``Guideline
for the Manufacture of In Vitro Diagnostic Products'' that contains production practices which are acceptable to
FDA for assuring the safety and effectiveness of in vitro diagnostic products. Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic
products may find the information in the guideline useful in developing procedures that comply with the current good
manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for these products. A draft document was previously made available for
public comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA first announced the availability for public comment of the draft guideline in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 7, 1988 (53 FR 11561). In that same issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (53 FR 11561), FDA announced the forthcoming meeting of the agency's Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory
Committee (the committee). As a result of the notice and the open public meeting, FDA received 17 letters providing
comments_14 from manufacturers, 2 from trade associations, and 1 from an attorney representing a manufacturer.
Presentations before the committee by industry and FDA resulted in committee recommendations that the agency: (1)
Continue to handle the document as a guideline; (2) change the title and/or scope of the document to clarify which products
are subject to the guideline; and (3) extend the comment period from June 6, 1988 to July 15, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA extended the comment period as recommended by the committee and revised the guideline based on the comments received.
A notice of availability of the second draft was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 19, 1990 (55 FR 14863).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since release of the second draft, four letters of comment have been received from two trade associations, one manufacturer,
and one user association. Meetings have also been held with the two trade associations_the Association of Microbiological
Diagnostic Manufacturers and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association. A total of 21 letters of comment were
received in response to all notices. These comments are on file with the Dockets Management Branch under Docket No.
88D&hyph;0087.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of availability of the draft guideline stated that it would be issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)),
which provides for the use of guidelines to establish procedures or standards of general applicability that are not
legal requirements but that are acceptable to the agency. The agency is now in the process of considering whether to
revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;10.90(b). Although that decision has not been made, the agency has decided to publish this guideline. However,
this notice and the final guideline are not being issued under the authority of &sect;10.90(b), and the final guideline,
although called a guideline, does not operate to bind FDA or any other person in any way. The agency advises that this
final guideline represents its current position on the requirements of the CGMP regulations for in vitro diagnostic
products. The guideline may be useful to manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic products. A person may also choose to
use alternate procedures even though they are not provided for in the guideline. If a person chooses to depart from
the practices and procedures set forth in the final guideline, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with
the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable
by FDA. This guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits
for or on any person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 23, 1993 (58 FR 61952), FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the medical device CGMP regulations.
Any revisions to the CGMP regulations may result in the need for changes to this guideline. Therefore, on issuing a
final rule to revise the CGMP regulations, FDA will review the guideline and make any necessary changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of this final guideline, along with previous drafts and submitted comments, are available for public examination
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may submit written comments on the final guideline to the Dockets Management Branch. Additional
comments will be considered in determining the future need for amending the final guideline. Two copies of comments
should be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments should be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. Windpower proposes to construct a 500 megawatt (MW) Wind Energy Project to be located on Foote Creek Rim and Simpson
Ridge in Carbon County, Wyoming. The project area is located approximately 40 miles (64.35 Km) southeast of Rawlins
and 40 miles (64.36 Km) northwest of Laramie, Wyoming. The Foote Creek Rim portion is in all or portions of approximately
10 sections in Townships 19N and 20N, Ranges 78W and 79W north and west of Arlington. Access to the Foote Creek Rim site
is from I&hyph;80 and State Highway 13. The Simpson Ridge portion is in all or portions of 92 sections in Townships 20N,
21N, and 22N, Ranges 80W and 81W, south of Hanna. Access to the Simpson Ridge portion is from I&hyph;80 and State Highway
287 and State Highway 72. Land ownership in the project area is approximately 62% private, 28% Public (administered
by BLM), and 10% State of Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project will be constructed in phases over a 10&hyph;12 year period. The first phase, involving 75 MW of electrical
power generated by approximately 215 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs), would be constructed on Foote Creek Rim in 1995&hyph;96.
Later phases would involve 50MW (approximately 75 WTGs/50 MW) increases per year, as utility contracts are approved,
until the 500 MW capacity is reached (for a total of 1,390 WTGs). Ancillary facilities include, but are not limited
to: above and below-ground electric and communication lines, access roads, substations, control/maintenance
building and transformer sites. The Bonneville Power Administration, Department of Energy, a Cooperating Agency
for the EIS, will execute a power output contract to purchase 25 MW of electricity from the project under element 2b
of BPA's Resource Supply Expansion Program. The Foote Creek Rim phase of the project would meet this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wind turbines will be erected on 80 to 120 ft (24 to 37 m) lattice towers with height determined by specific meteorological
and geographic characteristics. The WTGs are variable speed, up-wind, three-fiberglass-bladed machines with
a rotor diameter of 108 ft (33 m). The WTGs will be spaced approximately 162 to 216 ft (49 to 66 m) apart with approximately
1,080 to 1,620 ft (329 to 494 m) between each row. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two potential electrical utility interconnections are proposed. The first is with the PacifiCorp 230 kV system at
the Miner's substation at Hanna, WY. A wood pole 230 kV line would be erected from the project site northwest, approximately
25 mi (40 Km), to the Miner's substation. The second proposed interconnection would be with the Western Area Power
Administration's parallel 115 kV lines at a site in T21N, R77W, Sec. 34. A transmission line of approximately 7 mi (11
Km) would extend from the project site northeast to the proposed tap substation.

 Pursuant to the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;606), the Department of the Interior, Bureau
of Land Management, Steese/White Mountains District has prepared a Proposed Resource Management Plan (PRMP)/Final
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Fort Greely military withdrawal, which is located near Delta Junction,
Alaska, southeast of Fairbanks. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division (Light) assisted in drafting the plan. The
document addresses planning for nonmilitary use of the withdrawal. It addresses questions such as access, recreation,
timber and fuel wood harvesting, and wildlife habitat and cultural resource protection. Although mining is discussed,
none would be allowed in the immediate future because of potential conflicts with the military's mission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 (codified at 49 U.S.C. 10922(l)) imposed a 2-year moratorium (subject
to renewal) on the Commission's issuance of new grants of operating authority to motor carriers domiciled in or owned
or controlled by persons of Mexico or Canada. Under this statute, the President has the authority to remove or modify
the moratorium if he determines it to be in the national interest, that is, if overriding economic or foreign policy
considerations make such an action advisable, or if a negotiated settlement with one country or the other can be reached.
Under the moratorium, the President must notify the Congress in writing 60 days before the date on which the removal
or modification is to take effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Shortly after it went into effect, the President exercised his authority and removed the moratorium with respect
to Canada. The President indicated in a memorandum to the United States Trade Representative that the United States
and Canada had reached a bilateral understanding that would ensure fair and equitable treatment for both U.S. and
Mexican motor carriers on both sides of the International Boundary line. 47 FR 54053. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The moratorium remained in place for Mexican motor carriers because the Mexican Government continued to restrict
U.S. motor carriers' access to Mexico. Under the terms of the statute, the President extended the moratorium for 2-year
periods in 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, and, most recently, in 1992. On November 3, 1993, however, in a Statement of Administrative
Action, the President gave notice to Congress that he would lift the moratorium with respect to Mexican charter and
other tour services on NAFTA's effective date, that is, on January 1, 1994.

This satisfies the 60-day notice period called for under 49 U.S.C. 10922(l). In any event, Congress, in approving
NAFTA, specifically consented to the President's modifying the moratorium as announced on November 3, 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Phase 1 of NAFTA, Mexican domiciled or owned or controlled passenger carriers may now apply for authority under
49 U.S.C. 10922(c) to transport passengers in charter and tour bus service in the United States in foreign commerce,
that is, the service must begin or end in Mexico (or Canada). Wholly domestic interstate operations in the United States
cannot be authorized or permitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAFTA authorizes the granting of authority for charter operations and tour bus service only. By statute, we may authorize
motor common carriers of passengers to operate over either regular or irregular routes, but irregular-route services
must be limited to charter and special operations. Regular-route operations ordinarily involve the expeditious
transportation of passengers between fixed termini, over defined routes and according to established schedules.
Charter operations, on the other hand, ordinarily contemplate providing transportation for a group, assembled
by someone other than the carrier, which group contracts for the exclusive use of certain equipment for the duration
of a particular trip or tour. Generally, a flat rate for the use of the vehicle is charged, on either a ``mileage'' or
an ``hourly'' basis, and the passengers travel together for the entire trip.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we recognized most recently in Adirondack Transit Lines, Inc._Adirondack Trailways, 8 I.C.C.2d 330, 334 n.5 (1992),
special operations originally were described as services rendered (generally on weekends, holidays, or other special
occasions) to a number of passengers that the carrier itself has assembled into a travel group through its own sales
of a ticket to each individual passenger covering a particular trip or tour. Fordham Bus Corp. Common Carrier Application,

operations nor the usual operations of a regular-route carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, ``tour service'' is only one form of special operations, as the Commission discussed in Passenger Transportation
in Special Operations, 112 M.C.C. 160, 165&hyph;67, 171&hyph;74 (1970), which clearly distinguishes the requirements
of ``tour service'' from those of ordinary special operations. Thus, under the Bingler criterion, to constitute
a ``tour service'', the carrier must furnish something substantial in addition to, or different from, bare expeditious
transportation between two points. This contemplates a common interest of passengers visiting a particular place(s)
or event(s) and does not include ordinary, point-to-point transportation, over either regular or irregular routes.

 It appears that the ``tour service'' that NAFTA is intended to cover is this type of special operations.

Special operations that are not ``tour services'' might include, for example, limousine services in which door-to-door
service is provided, over irregular routes (according to the specific locations to be served on any particular trip),
to and from any point in a given territory. Such services will not be authorized by authority to provide ``tour service''.

Over irregular routes, in foreign commerce, transporting passengers, in charter operations and in special operations,
in tour service, between ports of entry on the international boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, on the one hand,
and, on the other, points in the United States (except Alaska and Hawaii).

Because this notice is occasioned by a partial lifting of the moratorium, no special rules or rulemaking are necessary.
The same application procedure and regulations apply to Mexican and United States carriers alike. For example, carriers
must abide by all U.S. Department of Transportation safety regulations, comply with the Commission's insurance
requirements (49 U.S.C. 10927), publish and file with the Commission applicable tariffs (49 U.S.C. 10761, 10762),
and file with the Commission agents for service of process (49 U.S.C. 10330). We will, however, provide a short comment
period to enable interested persons to submit written views, arguments or representations regarding this subject.
Because we have little or no discretion in this area, we do not contemplate a subsequent decision unless we receive
comments raising substantial issues it would be helpful or necessary to address. Notice of this proceeding will be
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ICC Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and interested parties will have 7 days from the date of publication to comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the current application form OP&hyph;1 requires all applicants for ICC operating authority to certify
that they are not domiciled in Mexico or owned or controlled by persons of Mexico. We will modify that certification
requirement when we revise the application form. For the present, Mexican charter and special operations applicants
should either disregard the certification section, or simply indicate ``not applicable.'' Applicants not completing
the certification affirmatively will receive charter and special operations tour service authority limited to
movements in foreign commerce.

 The Copyright Office publishes this notice to inform the public that the North American Free Trade Agreement which
entered into force on January 1, 1994, and its implementing legislation (Pub. L. No. 103-182) authorizes the Copyright
Office to establish procedures for copyright restoration of certain works first fixed or published in Mexico or Canada
after January 1, 1978 and before March 1, 1989. This notice is intended to summarize the content of that legislation.
Copyright owners of affected works must file a statement of intent with the Copyright Office to restore copyright
for eligible works; details of new procedures to file these statements will be published within the next 60 days.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The North American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. No.
103-182) provide for the restoration of copyright for certain works that are currently in the public domain in the
United States. Under new section 104A of title 17, copyright protection may be restored for certain motion pictures
that were first fixed or published in Mexico or Canada, and any work included in such motion pictures that was first
fixed or published with these motion pictures, if the work ``entered the public domain in the United States because
it was first published on or after January 1, 1978, and before March 1, 1989, without the notice required by sections
401, 402, or 403 of [title 17], the absence of which has not been excused by the operation of section 405 of [title 17],
as such sections were in effect during that period.'' 17 U.S.C. 104A(a) (1993). A motion picture or underlying work
(such as original music or dramatic text embodied in the motion picture) meeting these requirements ``shall have
copyright protection under [title 17] for the remainder of the term of copyright protection to which it would have
been entitled in the United States had it been published with such notice.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Copyright owners of qualifying works must file a ``statement of intent'' with the Copyright Office between January
1, 1994 (the date on which the Agreement entered into force) and January 1, 1995 to notify the public of their intent
to restore copyright protection for these works in the United States. After January 1, 1995, the Copyright Office
must publish in the Federal Register, the list of works for which statements have been filed and which are determined
to be properly qualified for protection. The restoration of copyright protection for these works will be provided
at that time in accordance with section 104A of title 17. Section 104A(c) of title 17 provides that persons who are copying,
performing or selling copies of such works may continue such activities for a period of one year following publication
of the 1995 Federal Register notice. This exemption applies only to copies produced or acquired before the date of
enactment of the implementing legislation (December 8, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the next 60 days, the Copyright Office will announce in the Federal Register the procedures necessary to file
a ``statement of intent'' with the Office, including the applicable statements and materials that must be submitted.
In the meantime, copyright owners and other interested parties can contact Eric Schwartz, Policy Planning Advisor,
Copyright Office, at (202) 707-8350, for additional information.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange seeks to discount its transaction, comparison and floor brokerage transaction and assessment fees
encompassing all transactions executed on the Phlx in equities, equity options, index options and foreign currency
options on the Phlx for the billing cycle beginning settlement date November 29, 1993, to settlement date December
31, 1993. The discount shall be a 33 percent reduction across-the-board for all fees, charges and assessments as described
above for the limited period from November 29, 1993, to December 31, 1993 (Phlx's final month's billing cycle) in recognition
of record volume and cost efficiencies anticipated to continue through December. In this regard, discounts will
not apply to non-transaction related fees and charges such as the floor facilities fees, booth and post rental fees,
as well as membership dues, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among members using its facilities. The proposed fee schedule change also aligns
service fees more closely to the cost of providing those services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were neither solicited nor received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore has
become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. At any
time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change
if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A two-part study assessing the capability of escort tugs to control disabled tankers in Prince William Sound, Alaska,
was commissioned by the Disabled Tanker Towing Study Group (DTTSG). The study will specifically review the present
equipment, personnel, and procedures aboard the tankers and escort vessels operating in Prince William Sound, as
well as the assist capabilities of the vessels presently in service for escorting these tankers. Part 1 of the study
has been completed, and the U.S. Coast Guard has been granted permission to make it available to the public. Certain
technical findings of this study will aid the U.S. Coast Guard in promulgating national-level tug escort regulations
under section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90).

Background and Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the aftermath of the EXXON VALDEZ grounding, the state of Alaska established a contingency plan that includes provisions
requiring laden tankers to be escorted through Prince William Sound. The escort vessels are expected to provide immediate
assistance to a tanker in the event it suffers a propulsion or steering failure. The escort vessels also have some spill
response capabilities. At present, there are 11 tugs and escort vessels in this service, operating out of Port Valdez
and escorting tankers to Hinchinbrook Entrance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Disabled Tanker Towing Study Group (DTTSG) was formed to review the present escort vessel practices in Prince
William Sound. The DTTSG is formed of representatives from the Regional Citizen's Advisory Council (RCAC) for Prince
William Sound, the Prince William Sound Tanker Association, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the Alaska Department
of Environmental Conservation, and the U.S. Coast Guard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DTTSG commissioned The Glosten Associates, Inc., to prepare a two-part study. The first part was to conduct an
expert review and evaluation of the emergency towing equipment aboard the tankers and escort vessels operating in
Prince William Sound. The second part was to determine, by means of actual tanker/tug trials and computer simulation
analyses, the capabilities of the escort vessels to actually control disabled tankers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4116(c) of OPA 90 requires the Secretary of Transportation to initiate issuance of regulations that define
areas where single hull tankers over 5,000 gross tons transporting oil in bulk must be escorted by at least two towing
vessels (as defined under 46 U.S.C. 2101), or by other vessels which the Secretary considers appropriate. These defined
areas must include Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Rosario Strait and Puget Sound, Washington (including those
portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca east of Port Angeles, Haro Strait, and the Strait of Georgia subject to U.S. jurisdiction).
The Secretary has delegated this responsibility to the Coast Guard.

Federal Regulatory Action to Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Coast Guard's regulatory response to this section of OPA 90 has been divided into two rulemaking projects: the
first project (CGD 91&hyph;202) focuses on the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters specifically identified
in the statute, the second project (CGD 91&hyph;202a) focuses on other navigable waters where escorts might be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to issue effective national escort rules, the Coast Guard finds it necessary to determine the realistic capabilities
of the various types of tugs that may be used for escort service. To this end, the Disabled Tanker Towing Study (DTTS)
is expected to provide valuable technical information. In addition to its participation in the DTTSG, Coast Guard's
other actions to date have been as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 7, 1992 (57 FR 30058). Because the original public comments did not include sufficient information on certain
issues, the comment period was reopened March 26, 1993 (58 FR 16391), with a request for more-detailed comments on
some specified issues. Altogether, more than 100 public comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking public comment on other navigable waters where escort
vessels should be required was published April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25766). This ANPRM also requested detailed comments
on some specified issues. More than 45 public comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Three public hearings were held: in Anchorage, Alaska, on June 3, 1993; Valdez, Alaska, on June 5, 1993; and Seattle,
Washington, on June 7, 1993. Both Alaska hearings had teleconferencing arrangements to include outlying communities
in the Exxon Valdez impacted areas. All three hearings were well attended. Locally-interested parties, including
individuals and representatives of environmental, commercial fishing, and recreational groups, tug operators,
pilots, and tanker operators, made presentations at each hearing. Transcripts of the three hearings have been put
in files 43, 44, and 45 of Coast Guard docket 91&hyph;202a.

Summary of the Study
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Executive Summary from Part 1 of the DTTS, ``Evaluation of Existing Equipment, Personnel and Procedures,'' is
reprinted here verbatim:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``This study has been undertaken by The Glosten Associates, Inc., to evaluate the existing capability for emergency
towing at Prince William Sound and to examine alternatives that could enhance the escort and assist capabilities
for disabled tankers within the waterway from the Alyeska Oil Terminal at the Port of Valdez to the Gulf of Alaska outside
Hinchinbrook Entrance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 1, reported herein, is an objective evaluation by an experienced salvage towing master of the existing tugs,
emergency towing equipment, towing practices, and discussion of alternate tug types. Part 2 will evaluate alternative
equipment and deployments, using engineering methods, including simulation, that could improve the safety or cost-effectiveness
of the response system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Part 1 investigation was performed by subcontractor Smit Tak BV, based in Rotterdam. Captain Jan ter Haar, a senior
Smit Tak salvage master, conducted interviews and observed normal operations and emergency drills in the Valdez
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Captain ter Haar feels that, with some changes such as improved bow fendering, the existing escort/response vessels
(ERVs) are adequate to control a ship's heading in the event of a steering failure and to tow it in the event of loss of
propulsive power. He reserves any final opinion on the number of such vessels required to control an incident, in relation
to the size of tanker and the weather conditions, to the results of simulations in Part 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All tankers calling at Valdez are required to carry specific emergency towing gear for rapid deployment and connection
to a rescue tug. This ``Prince William Sound Emergency Towing Package'' is stowed and deployed differently on various
vessels. Captain ter Haar recommends that all vessels adopt systems that can be readied for deployment in 15 minutes
or less by a crew of two without using winch power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Captain ter Haar demonstrated in drills several effective alternative methods of making towing connections with
the tugs' own gear, without deploying the ship's Prince William Sound Towing Package. Drills were also used to assess
crew skills in towing large tankers in adverse weather with multiple tugs. He concludes that additional drills and
training, both in the makeup and towing operations, would be beneficial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to escort vessel operations, Captain ter Haar recommends that, in the Valdez Narrows area, escort position
should be in close proximity to tankers for faster response to a steering failure. However, in the more open waters
of Prince William Sound, where a power or steering failure will not result in immediate peril of grounding, close escort
does not increase the level of safety of the system. Escort vessels strategically positioned at key locations would
appear to provide the same level of protection. This deployment issue will be analyzed more thoroughly in Part 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Captain ter Haar concludes that the vessels presently under contract are suitable for rescue towing in Prince William
Sound under a full range of weather conditions. In the open waters of the Gulf of Alaska, at and beyond Hinchinbrook
Entrance, he concludes that a larger salvage tug would improve the capability to prevent a major casualty.''

Anticipated Course of Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second phase of the DTTS (tanker/tug maneuvering trials and computer simulation analyses) is currently underway.
The Coast Guard has been informed that the technical data collection should be completed by January, 1994, and that
Part 2 of the study will be released by spring, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the meantime, the Coast Guard is now reviewing all public comments and studying various technical submittals,
including Part 1 of the DTTS. Because the Federal regulations that it ultimately proposes as a result of this review
will probably differ from those proposed in the NPRM, the Coast Guard plans to issue a Supplementary Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (SNPRM). The Coast Guard anticipates issuing the SNPRM after Part 2 of the study has been reviewed and analyzed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Partners must submit a signed Partnership Agreement Form and enclose it with the application. As indicated in 34 CFR
472.2, it is essential that the partners sign and submit this document in order for their application to be considered
complete. If the agreement is retyped, the applicant should make sure that none of the wording is changed. Any changes
in wording could alter the meaning of the agreement and thus render the application ineligible. Any reference in the
application to an organization as a partner in the project is considered to mean a bona fide partner in the partnership
who must sign the partnership agreement. If the document is not signed by all organizations identified as partners
and submitted with the application or if the wording is changed and alters the meaning of the agreement, the Secretary
will return the application without further consideration for funding pursuant to 34 CFR 75.216. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preference is given under this program to an application that includes one or more small businesses as a partner. For
the purpose of this program, to claim a small business preference, the applicant must certify which of the partner
enterprises is a small business under the Small Business Administration's Size Standards: Final and Interim Final
Rules (13 CFR part 121) and furnish the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code in the Final and Interim Final
Rules within which each such enterprise classifies itself. The SIC code for a small business partner must be entered
in the space provided on the Partnership Agreement Form.

 The National Workplace Literacy Program includes a statutory requirement that Federal funds supplement, and not
supplant, non-Federal funds. 34 CFR 75.563 requires programs of this type to use a restricted indirect cost rate.
34 CFR 75.564&hyph;75.568 provides the formula for determining the restricted indirect cost rate and provides definitions
of terms used in the formula. A grantee other than a State or local government may use the restricted indirect cost rate
or eight percent, whichever is less. Copies of part 75 of 34 CFR may be obtained from the Government Printing Office
by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. Telephone:
(202) 783&hyph;3238. These regulations may also be found at many local libraries.

Prepare a detailed Budget Narrative for the first year of the project that justifies, and/or clarifies the budget
figures shown in sections A and B. (Please note that the National Literacy Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;73) amended
the section of the Adult Education Act that authorizes the National Workplace Literacy Program to permit any eligible
organization to use 100 percent Federal funds for administrative costs incurred in establishing a project during
a start-up period. 34 CFR 472.32(b) requires that an applicant minimize the start-up period, if any, proposed for
its project and that the start-up period not exceed six months.) Explain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The basis used to estimate certain costs (professional personnel, consultants, travel, indirect costs) and any
other cost that may appear unusual; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How the major cost items relate to the proposed project activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The costs of the project's evaluation component; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What matching occurs in each budget category; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Instructions for Part V_Application Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before preparing the Application Narrative, an applicant should read carefully the description of the program and
the selection criteria the Secretary uses to evaluate applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The narrative should encompass each function or activity for which funds are being requested and should_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Begin with an Abstract; that is, a summary of the proposed project including a list of the members of the partnership;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Describe the proposed project in light of each of the selection criteria in the order in which the criteria are listed
in this application package; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Include any other pertinent information that might assist the Secretary in reviewing the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary strongly requests the applicant to limit the Application Narrative to no more than 50 double-spaced,
typed, 81/2
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; x 11
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; pages (on one side only), although the Secretary will consider applications of greater length. Be sure that
each page of your application is numbered consecutively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Include as an appendix to the Application Narrative supporting documentation, also on 81/2
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; x 11
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; paper (e.g., letters of support, footnotes, resumes, etc.), or any other pertinent information that might
assist the Secretary in reviewing the application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted, regardless of the circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. We just missed the deadline for a previous Department of Education competition. May we submit the application we
prepared for it under this competition? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. However the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications
of the competition to which it is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We are happy to discuss any questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various competitions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How can I best ensure that my application is received on time and is considered under the correct competition? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Applicants should carefully follow the instructions for filing applications that are set forth in this notice.
Be sure that Block 10 of the face page of the application (Standard form 424) clearly indicates the CFDA number 84.198,
and the title of the program_National Workplace Literacy Program_representing the competition in which the application
should be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Will you help us prepare our application? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priority. Applicants should understand that this previous contact is not required,
nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How long should an application be? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The Department of Education is making a concerted effort to reduce the volume of paperwork in discretionary program
applications. However, the scope and complexity of projects is too variable to establish firm limits on length. Your
application should provide enough information to allow the review panel to evaluate the significance of the project
against the criteria of the competition. We recommend that you address all of the selection criteria in an ``Application
Narrative'' of no more than 50 pages in length. Supporting documentation may be included in appendices to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application Narrative. Some examples: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Staff qualifications. These should be brief. They should include the person's title and role in the proposed project
and contain only information about his or her qualifications that are relevant to the proposed project. Qualifications
of consultants should be provided and be similarly brief. Resumes may be included in the appendices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Copies of evaluation instruments proposed to be used in the project in instances where such instruments are not
in general use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Copies (samples) of any curricula that reflect the applicant's experience and the scope and direction of any current
or previous projects related to this application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that a Budget Narrative describing specific uses of funds requested in the budget form also is required. No applications
will be funded without this material. The Budget Narrative is not included in the recommended 50 page limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How should my application be organized? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The applicant should assemble its package in the following order: The SF 424 on top, followed by the abstract, Partnership
Agreement Form, table of contents, Budget Information Form, Budget Narrative, Application Narrative, assurances
and certifications, and appendices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Do not substitute your own cover for the SF 424. Please include one extra, loose copy of the SF 424 for use by the Application
Control Center. Please number all pages. The Application Narrative should be organized to follow the exact sequence
of the components in the selection criteria in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can project funds be used to cover travel expenses? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Travel associated with carrying out the project can be funded using program funds if necessary and reasonable.
The Secretary anticipates that the project director, one business or labor representative, and the evaluator will
attend three developmental staff meetings over the course of the project (one start-up conference, one mid-point
conference, and one close-out conference). Therefore, you may wish to include the costs of nine trips to Washington,
D.C. in the travel budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How can I ensure that my application is filed on behalf of a validly formed partnership? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The requirements for forming a partnership and filing an application on its behalf are explained in &sect;472.2
of the program regulations. A partnership requires a signed agreement between at least one entity described in &sect;472.2(a)(1)
and at least one entity described in &sect;472.2(a)(2). Note that State and local governments_like any other entities_may
not qualify as partners unless they fall within these descriptions. For example, under the regulations, a State or
local educational agency or a municipal employment and training agency is an eligible partner, but a State or city
government is not an eligible partner. No agency of the Federal government is an eligible partner. Federal employees
including members of the armed services are not eligible for training. If you are not sure whether a particular entity
is an eligible partner, please call the program officers listed as information contacts in the application notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can entities that are not eligible partners be involved in a workplace literacy project? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. They could potentially be involved as ``contractors,'' ``helping organizations,'' or ``sites,'' as defined
in &sect;472.5 of the regulations. Note that entities that are ``helpers'' or ``sites'' may not receive funds from
the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Must the signed partnership agreement be submitted with the application? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The agreement is required both to establish the partnership's legal eligibility and to ensure each partner's
continuing commitment during the workplace literacy project. Prior to submitting an application, partners should
ensure that each partner clearly understands its role and responsibilities in the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department interprets even a single reference in the application to an organization as a partner to mean that it
is a bona fide partner in the partnership and, thus, is required to sign the partnership agreement. The applicant should
be careful to designate partners, helpers, contractors, etc. in the same way wherever they are mentioned throughout
the application. Because partnership requirements are established by law, the Department reviews each agreement
form to be certain that it meets the terms of the law requiring all entities named as partners to sign the agreement.
The Department wishes to underscore that if any of the entities named as partners in the application have not signed
the agreement form, the application will be returned to the applicant without further consideration for funding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How does the Department define ``small business''? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. In 34 CFR 472.5, the Department defines ``small business'' as a business entity that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is organized for profit, with a place of business located in the United States and that makes a significant contribution
to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor, or both; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) May be in the legal form of an individual proprietorship, partnership, corporation, joint venture, association,
trust or a cooperative, except that where the form is a joint venture there can be no more than 49 percent participation
by foreign business entities in the joint venture; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Meets the requirements found in 13 CFR part 121 concerning Standard Industrial Classification codes and size
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you are not sure whether or not you meet the definition of a small business, you may want to contact your local district
office or regional office of the Small Business Administration (SBA) for advice. If you are unable to locate those
offices you may call the SBA's Office of Size Standards at (202) 205&hyph;6618. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. May an application including a business partner that is a small local affiliate of a larger corporation receive
the small business priority points? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The overall size of the business partner and its affiliates will determine the answer. Size determinations must
include the business partner and all its domestic and foreign affiliates regardless of whether the affiliates are
organized for profit. 13 CFR 121.401 describes affiliating circumstances for size determination purposes and establishes
exceptions thereto. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. May an application including a business partner that operates as the small local franchisee or licensee of a larger
corporation receive the small business priority points? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Small business priority points may be awarded when a business partner meets the following three conditions: It
(1) is a local franchisee or licensee within the size determination standards, (2) has the right to profit from its
efforts and (3) bears the risk of loss commensurate with ownership. Exceptions to this general interpretation may
arise where affiliation results from other means than the franchise or license agreement such as common ownership,
common management or excessive restrictions on the sale of the franchise interest. See &sect;121.401(m) of 13 CFR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Must a small business participant be a partner for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application to qualify for the small business priority points? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The small business participant must be a partner who has signed the Partnership Agreement for the application
to qualify for the extra points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Must an applicant provide the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for the small business partner in
order to receive the small business priority points? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The SIC code must be entered on the line provided on the Partnership Agreement form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What is meant by a required percent of non-Federal cost-sharing or matching funds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. In this program, the recipient of Federal funds is required to ``match'' the Federal grant by paying at least a minimum
percentage of total program costs. Total program costs include both the Federal funds received and the non-Federal
contribution. For example, a partnership that is required to pay 30 percent of total program costs of $100,000 would
have to contribute $30,000 to match a Federal award of $70,000 ($30,000 = 30 percent of $100,000 ($30,000 plus $70,000)).
All partnerships must contribute at least 30 percent of total program costs, except that partnerships may receive
full reimbursement for their necessary and reasonable administrative costs incurred in establishing a project
during the project start-up period. That period should be minimized and may not exceed six months, at which time the
project is expected to provide services to adult workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What costs may be included in the 30 percent match (cash or in-kind)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Any cost that can be paid with Federal funds from this program is allowable as match (see Education Department General
Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR 74.50&hyph;74.57 and 34 CFR 80.24). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What costs are not allowed using project funds (Federal or non-Federal match)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The following items are not allowable costs in the National Workplace Literacy Program: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Life skills such as balancing a checkbook, learning to read to children, writing personal correspondence,
etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Personal counseling such as counseling for alcoholism, mental health, health, domestic problems, or housing
issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull; Job skills or vocational training such as direct training in statistical process control (SPC) rather than
literacy skills needed for SPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Computer literacy, defined as any training above the level of computer competence needed to operate a computer-assisted
program of instruction used in a workplace literacy project. Non-allowable costs include teaching of word processing,
WordPerfect, Lotus, dBase, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Stipends or tuition payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Training of supervisors, other than those one step up from targeted workers such as maintenance crew supervisors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Construction costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutional allowance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any unreasonable or unnecessary cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. May a project provide vocational or job training activities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Projects must provide adult education programs that teach literacy skills needed in the workplace. Workplace
literacy activities include only the adult education activities listed in the Description of Program section of
the Notice Inviting Applications. This list does not include vocational or job training activities such as auto mechanics,
dye casting, tailoring, and statistical process control. Workplace literacy instruction, however, may enable
individuals to benefit subsequently or simultaneously from advanced vocational skills training provided from
other funds. If you are not sure whether a particular activity is eligible under this program, please call one of the
program officers listed as information contacts in the application notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. May a project provide training in operating a computer? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Training to operate a computer that is part of the performance of a job is a form of vocational or job training and is
not an eligible activity under this program. However, computers could be used as a means of instruction if this were
necessary and reasonable under the circumstances of a particular project. In such a context, it would be permissible
to ensure that students possessed those rudimentary skills that are necessary to interact with computer-assisted
literacy instruction.

Q. What should be disseminated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The criterion ``Demonstration'' encourages applicants to use certain dissemination strategies but does not
preclude the use of additional strategies that are appropriate for a particular project. Projects should distribute
materials that will help others to adopt promising practices arising from the project, such as assessment instruments,
recruitment materials, job task analysis materials, staff development materials, curricula, etc. The Department
does not expect or anticipate that partnerships will disseminate trade secrets or other protected information.
However, a project's dissemination activities should clearly benefit businesses and workplaces outside of the
partnership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What is the Department of Education's Program Effectiveness Panel? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. As mentioned in the note to the criterion ``Evaluation plan,'' the Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP) is a mechanism
that the Department has developed for validating the effectiveness of educational programs developed by schools,
universities, and other agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific criteria for PEP review are found at 34 CFR 786.12 or 787.12. For further information about PEP, prospective
applicants may wish to read Making the Case: Evidence of Effectiveness in Schools and Classrooms, which contains
criteria and guidelines for submitting project results to PEP. This publication is available from the U.S. Department
of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement, 555 New Jersey Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20208&hyph;5645.

Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The original application should be bound and clearly marked as the original application bearing the original signatures.
In addition six copies should be submitted and marked as copies. Local or State Agencies may choose to submit two copies
with the original. Applications should not include foldouts, photographs, audio-visuals, or other materials that
are hard to duplicate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. You can expect to receive notification within 8 to 9 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of competitions with closing dates at about the same time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We do not return applications. Therefore, applicants should retain at least one copy of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What happens during negotiations between high ranking applicants and the U.S. Department of Education grants
office? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. During negotiations, technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are issues
that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions may
also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification
or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion
of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may
provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions
will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification
for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved.
